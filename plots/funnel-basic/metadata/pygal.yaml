review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native Funnel chart type with proper data structure
  - Clean, distinct color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Values displayed on each segment with proper number formatting (comma separators)
  - Legend correctly identifies all stages with matching colors
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic sales funnel data matching the specification example exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Value formatter includes percentage but only raw numbers display on the chart
  - Large vertical gap between funnel visualization and bottom legend creates visual
    imbalance
  - Horizontal funnel orientation differs from spec description of top to bottom narrowing
    (pygal library design choice)
