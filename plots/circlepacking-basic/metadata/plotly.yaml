review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world file system storage scenario that makes the hierarchy intuitive
  - 'Good use of Plotly-specific features: shapes for circles, annotations for labels,
    invisible scatter traces for hover info'
  - Clean color coding by category with consistent Python-themed palette
  - Circle sizes correctly scale by area using sqrt for radius calculation
  - White borders effectively separate hierarchy levels
  weaknesses:
  - Leaf node circles (level 2) are drawn but have no visible labels - only subcategory
    labels are shown, missing the 3rd level visualization
  - No legend to explain what the four colors represent (Documents, Media, Projects,
    System)
  - Title includes Storage Analysis prefix instead of just the required format spec-id
    library pyplots.ai
  - Four separate quadrants with gap in center rather than a proper packed layout
    with root circle
