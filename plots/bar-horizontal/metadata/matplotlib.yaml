review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for all elements
  - Proper sorting of bars (largest at top) for easy visual comparison
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed top/right spines
  - Value labels positioned perfectly at bar ends with proper formatting
  - Realistic data scenario that is immediately understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Could highlight the top 1-3 languages with a different color to draw attention
    as suggested in spec
  - Bar edge color adds visual complexity without clear benefit
