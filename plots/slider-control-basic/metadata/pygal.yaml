review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent HTML implementation with functional slider control, year display, and
    smooth transitions between years
  - Good use of pygal SVG capabilities to pre-render charts for each year in the HTML
    version
  - Clean, well-organized code with realistic seasonal sales data showing year-over-year
    growth
  - Proper use of fixed y-axis range (0-220) for consistent comparison across years
    in the interactive version
  - Nice styling with custom colors, value formatting, and professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - PNG preview shows grouped bar chart with ALL years instead of single-year view
    with slider indication - fundamentally misrepresents the slider-control spec
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the core slider functionality that defines this
    plot type
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart titled "Quarterly Sales
    by Year · slider-control-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai". The x-axis shows quarters
    (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and the y-axis shows "Sales (thousands USD)" ranging from $0K
    to $200K+. Five color-coded series represent years 2020-2024: blue (2020), yellow
    (2021), darker blue (2022), muted yellow-green (2023), and gray (2024). Each quarter
    shows 5 bars grouped together, demonstrating year-over-year growth with Q4 having
    the highest values. The legend appears at the bottom with labels for each year.'

        comment: '**MAJOR ISSUE**: PNG shows grouped bar chart with ALL years, NOT
          a slider-controlled single-year view. The spec requires "slider widget that
          allows users to dynamically control a parameter" - PNG cannot demonstrate
          slider functionality'
