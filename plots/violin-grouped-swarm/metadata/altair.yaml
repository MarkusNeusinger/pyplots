review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative API with transform_density for violin shapes
  - Good implementation of jitter using transform_calculate for swarm effect
  - Clean faceted layout separates task types clearly
  - Appropriate transparency on violins allows swarm points to remain visible
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful patterns (experts faster, less variance)
  - Proper color-coding with swarm points matching violin colors
  weaknesses:
  - Swarm points appear slightly misaligned with violin positions in some facets (particularly
    Simple Novice)
  - Missing subtle grid lines would improve readability
  - Legend title says Expertise Level but data column is Expertise - minor inconsistency
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm overlay showing
    response times across three task types (Simple, Moderate, Complex) faceted horizontally.
    Each facet contains two violin shapes colored by expertise level: Novice in steel
    blue (#306998) and Expert in golden yellow (#FFD43B). Individual data points are
    overlaid as circles with slight horizontal jitter, matching their respective violin
    colors. The title "violin-grouped-swarm · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The y-axis shows "Response Time (s)" ranging from 0-13, and the x-axis labels
    each facet by Task Type. A legend on the right identifies the Expertise Level
    with appropriately sized symbols. Violins have 50% opacity allowing swarm points
    to show through. The data demonstrates expected patterns: novices have higher
    and more variable response times, with complexity increasing times for both groups.'
