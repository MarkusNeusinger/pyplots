review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of ggbunch to compose a complex multi-plot layout
  - Appropriate color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic iris-like data with meaningful correlations between species
  - Clean KISS code structure following repository standards
  - Tooltips provide detailed information on hover
  weaknesses:
  - 'Missing key interactive features: linked brushing/selection across subplots (core
    spec requirement)'
  - Legend shows invisible points (alpha=0.0) - should show visible colored markers
  - 'Redundant axis labeling: both row/column edge labels AND per-cell axis titles
    create visual clutter'
  - No zoom/pan functionality as specified
  - Some unused imports in the code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) visualizing
    relationships between four iris flower measurements: Sepal Length, Sepal Width,
    Petal Length, and Petal Width. The diagonal cells contain histograms showing the
    distribution of each variable, while off-diagonal cells show scatter plots comparing
    pairs of variables. Three species are color-coded: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor
    (orange #E67E22), and Virginica (teal #16A085). The title "scatter-matrix-interactive
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Row labels appear on the left side
    (Sepal L, Sepal W, Petal L, Petal W) and column labels at the bottom. A horizontal
    legend at the bottom identifies the three species. The plot shows clear clustering
    patterns with Setosa well-separated from Versicolor and Virginica, particularly
    in petal measurements.'
