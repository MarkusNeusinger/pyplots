review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of letsplot show_half parameter (-1 and 1) to create proper split
    violins
  - Well-designed data scenario with varied distributions showing different improvement
    levels per department
  - Includes inner boxplots for better distribution visualization as recommended in
    spec
  - Proper color scheme using Python Blue/Yellow that is colorblind-safe
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML export
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scale export
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear slightly more prominent than ideal despite alpha=0.3 setting
  - Star import with many noqa comments reduces code clarity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a split violin visualization comparing employee
    satisfaction scores before and after office redesign across four departments:
    Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Design. Each violin is split with yellow (Python
    Yellow #FFD43B) on the left representing "Before" and blue (Python Blue #306998)
    on the right representing "After". Inner boxplots are embedded within each violin
    half showing quartiles and median lines, with a few outlier points visible. The
    y-axis spans from 15 to 105 (satisfaction score 0-100), x-axis shows department
    names, and a legend on the right indicates the Period (Before/After). All text
    is clearly legible with appropriately sized fonts.'
