review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative faceting syntax with .facet() for clean
    2D grid creation
  - Well-structured agricultural scenario that naturally demonstrates multi-dimensional
    data exploration
  - Clean color palette (blue, yellow, green) that is both aesthetically pleasing
    and colorblind-safe
  - Proper use of Altair encoding types (:Q for quantitative, :N for nominal)
  - Good axis labels with units and appropriate scale configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned at the edge of the canvas rather than integrated closer to
    the plot area
  - Could benefit from interactive selections (Altair's distinctive feature) to highlight
    crop types across all facets
