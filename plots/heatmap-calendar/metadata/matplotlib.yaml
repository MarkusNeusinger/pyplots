review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style calendar heatmap implementation with proper week/day structure
  - Custom colormap using LinearSegmentedColormap closely matches GitHub contribution
    colors
  - Realistic data generation with weekday bias and occasional high-activity days
  - Clean removal of axis spines for a modern, minimalist look
  - Month labels positioned at top exactly as specified
  - Proper inversion of y-axis so Monday appears at top (standard convention)
  - White cell borders provide clear visual separation between days
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar could be larger (shrink=0.4 makes it relatively small) for better readability
  - The code iterates through DataFrame rows inefficiently - could use vectorized
    operations
  - Missing some edge cases in data patterns (e.g., extended no-activity periods,
    project deadline spikes)
