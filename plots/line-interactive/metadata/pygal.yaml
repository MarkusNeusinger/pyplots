review:
  strengths:
  - Clean seasonal temperature pattern with realistic daily variation demonstrates
    time series well
  - Excellent custom Style configuration with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Proper tooltip customization with formatted date and temperature values
  - Good axis labeling with units (°C) and descriptive titles
  - Smart x-axis label management showing only major labels every 30 days to prevent
    clutter
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static/interactive versions
  weaknesses:
  - PNG output is inherently static; the interactive features (hover, zoom, pan, range
    selection) specified in the spec are only available in the HTML output - this
    is a limitation of the PNG format, not a code issue
  - Single data series limits feature demonstration; could show multiple locations
    or metrics for comparison
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing daily temperature data
    for 2024. The chart uses a blue color (#306998 - Python Blue) for the line with
    small dots marking each data point. The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging
    from approximately -2 to 36 degrees. The x-axis shows "Date" with major labels
    approximately every 30 days (Jan 01, Jan 31, Mar 01, Mar 31, etc.) rotated at
    45 degrees. The title reads "Daily Temperature 2024 · line-interactive · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend labeled "Temperature" appears at the bottom.
    The data shows a clear seasonal sinusoidal pattern with winter lows around 0-8°C
    and summer highs around 25-36°C, with daily noise variation creating the jagged
    appearance. The background is white with subtle horizontal grid lines.

        comment: Good use of pygal's Style customization, custom tooltips with formatted
          labels, and dual SVG/PNG/HTML output; could leverage more pygal-specific
          features like built-in animations or explicit interactivity configurations
  verdict: APPROVED
