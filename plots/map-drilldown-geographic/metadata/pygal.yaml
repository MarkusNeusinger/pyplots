review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color palette with distinct tiers
  - Comprehensive hierarchical data structure covering 5 countries, states, and cities
  - Realistic business scenario (regional sales) with appropriate value ranges
  - Good use of pygal_maps_world for choropleth visualization
  - Clean separation between PNG (static overview) and HTML (interactive drill-down)
  - Title follows correct spec format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears truncated ($1B+ click to drill cut off)
  - PNG is inherently limited for demonstrating drill-down capability (core spec requirement)
  - Breadcrumb text World > Click any country... is misleading for a static PNG image
  - String-based JSON conversion is fragile compared to using json module
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map (choropleth style) showing regional
    sales data at the top level. Five countries are highlighted with distinct colors
    representing sales tiers: United States in dark blue (largest, $1B+ Sales), Japan
    in orange ($500M-$1B Sales), Germany and Brazil in teal/green ($300M-$500M Sales),
    and Australia in purple (<$300M Sales). The remaining countries are shown in light
    gray with no fill. The title "map-drilldown-geographic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center. At the bottom, there is a breadcrumb text "World > Click any
    country to drill down to states/provinces" and a legend showing the four sales
    tier categories with their corresponding colors. The legend items are displayed
    horizontally at the bottom.'
