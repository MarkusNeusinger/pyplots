review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the slope chart concept with clear visual distinction
    between increasing and decreasing trends
  - Labels at both endpoints follow the spec requirement perfectly with product names
    and values
  - Color coding (blue for increase, yellow for decrease) is intuitive and colorblind-accessible
  - Good use of Bokeh Label model for precise text positioning
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with readable fonts
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool for interactive exploration of exact values when viewing HTML
    version
  - Label text could be slightly larger (20pt instead of 18pt) for optimal readability
    at the target resolution
