review:
  strengths:
  - Clean rectangular cladogram layout accurately representing primate evolutionary
    relationships
  - Excellent use of scale bar with proper units (substitutions per site)
  - Clade annotations (Hominini, Homininae, Hominidae) add scientific context
  - Good color scheme with distinct leaf nodes (yellow) and internal nodes (blue)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain node color meanings (leaf vs internal nodes)
  - Clade labels are somewhat small and could be more prominent
  - Could add hover tooltips showing species details for better interactivity
  - Right side of canvas has significant empty space; tree could be better centered
