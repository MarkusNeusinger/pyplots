review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizontal bar chart with proper sorting by importance
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper layering (zero_line, bars, error_bars)
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity showing feature name, mean importance,
    and std dev
  - Sequential blue color gradient effectively emphasizes high-importance features
  - Error bars clearly visible and properly positioned
  - Realistic housing price ML scenario with plausible feature names and importance
    values
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines that would help readers trace values across the chart
  - Could benefit from adding .interactive() for zoom/pan capabilities on the HTML
    version
