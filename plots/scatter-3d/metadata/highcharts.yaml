review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format following the required pattern with clear subtitle
  - Three clearly distinguishable clusters using colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow,
    teal)
  - Proper 3D visualization with subtle frame planes providing depth cues
  - All axis labels include units as recommended in the spec
  - Good marker sizing and opacity (radius 14, opacity 0.8) for 150 data points
  - Code is reproducible with np.random.seed(42)
  - Generates both PNG screenshot and interactive HTML output
  - Clean 3D perspective with appropriate alpha/beta angles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning could be improved; currently isolated with significant empty
    space between chart and legend
  - Missing explicit drag-to-rotate interactivity which is a signature Highcharts
    3D feature mentioned in the spec
  - Uses raw JavaScript config rather than highcharts-core Python library, making
    it less maintainable
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3D scatter visualization with three distinct
    clusters rendered in Highcharts. The title "scatter-3d · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold with a subtitle "Three-dimensional clustered data visualization".
    Three clusters are shown: Cluster A (dark blue/Python Blue, #306998) positioned
    in the upper-right area, Cluster B (yellow/Python Yellow, #FFD43B) in the middle-left
    area, and Cluster C (teal, #17BECF) scattered in the lower portion. Each axis
    is labeled with units: "X Position (units)", "Y Position (units)", and "Z Position
    (units)". The 3D perspective includes subtle blue-tinted frame planes at the bottom,
    back, and side. A vertical legend on the right identifies the three clusters.
    The overall layout is clean with good use of the canvas space.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts 3D module with scatter3d type, 3D frame planes, interactive
          tooltips, and hover states; however, interactive rotation (drag-to-rotate)
          which is Highcharts' signature 3D feature is not explicitly enabled
  verdict: APPROVED
