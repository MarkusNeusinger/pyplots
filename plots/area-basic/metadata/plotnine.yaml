review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three well-placed annotations (peak, maintenance
    dip, LOWESS trend label) and an informative subtitle
  - 'Strong aesthetic choices: Python Blue + gold palette, custom panel background,
    refined grid styling, intentional typography hierarchy'
  - Idiomatic plotnine usage with grammar-of-graphics layering and geom_smooth(method=lowess)
    for trend visualization
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with rich data features (weekly cycles, upward
    trend, maintenance dip, brief plateau)
  weaknesses:
  - The y-axis starting at 0 wastes vertical space — the solid-blue region below ~1,000
    visitors adds no information and compresses the actual data variation into the
    upper portion
  - The 6-layer gradient fill creates visible step banding rather than a smooth gradient;
    increasing the number of layers or using a different approach would improve visual
    smoothness
  - Adding gradient_layers individually (indices 0-5) is verbose; code could be more
    elegant
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart of daily website visitors
    over January 2024. The filled area uses a layered gradient effect in Python Blue
    (#306998), with six semi-transparent layers creating a gradient from lighter blue
    at the bottom to darker blue near the data line. A dark blue outline (#1e4d6d)
    at size 1.8 traces the data values. A golden-yellow LOWESS trend line (#FFD43B)
    smoothly shows the overall upward trajectory. The title "area-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top (~24pt), with an italic subtitle describing
    the data narrative. The x-axis reads "Date (January 2024)" with tick labels from
    Jan 01 through Jan 29 (~5 labeled ticks). The y-axis reads "Daily Visitors (count)"
    with comma-formatted values from 0 to 7,500. Three annotations are present: "Peak:
    8,213" in bold dark blue at upper right, "Maintenance: 3,242" in italic gray near
    the mid-month dip around Jan 15, and "Trend (LOWESS)" in golden-brown near the
    trend line. The background is white with a subtle light-gray panel. Major y-gridlines
    in light gray and faint x-gridlines are visible. Weekly cyclical patterns are
    clearly visible, with an overall upward trend from ~5,000 to ~8,000 visitors.'
