review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of 100% stacked area chart using Highcharts native stacking:
    percent feature'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between all three areas
  - Well-configured tooltip showing percentage values for interactive use
  - Realistic market share scenario that perfectly demonstrates the chart purpose
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins and text sizing
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines on the chart area, which could help readers trace values
    more precisely
  - 'Legend symbols use symbolRadius: 0 (squares) which is fine but circular markers
    might match the data point markers better'
