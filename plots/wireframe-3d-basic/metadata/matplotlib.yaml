review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the ripple function z = sin(sqrt(x² + y²)) as specified
  - Proper viewing angle (elevation 30°, azimuth 45°) matching specification exactly
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Subtle grid styling with transparent panes enhances 3D visibility
  - Good use of 40x40 grid resolution within recommended 20-50 range
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels use generic X, Y, Z instead of more descriptive labels
  - Wireframe linewidth at 1.5 is slightly thin for 4800x2700 output; 2-3 would be
    more visible
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D wireframe visualization of the ripple
    function z = sin(sqrt(x² + y²)). The wireframe is rendered in Python Blue (#306998)
    with consistent linewidth creating a mesh grid structure. The surface shows the
    characteristic concentric ripple pattern emanating from the center (0,0), with
    peaks at approximately z=1 and troughs at z=-1. The viewing angle is set at elevation
    30° and azimuth 45°, providing a good perspective of the 3D structure. All three
    axes (X, Y, Z) are labeled with clear tick marks ranging from -6 to 6 for X and
    Y, and -1.0 to 1.0 for Z. The title "wireframe-3d-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The grid panes have subtle gray edges and a dashed grid pattern
    with low alpha. The overall layout is well-balanced with the 3D plot utilizing
    good canvas space.
