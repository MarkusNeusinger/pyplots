review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of modified Prim's algorithm for circular maze generation
    ensuring exactly one solution
  - Clean visual design with black walls on white background suitable for printing
  - Proper use of Arc patches for curved concentric walls with gaps for passages
  - Good scaling of sectors per ring (8→32) to maintain reasonable sector sizes
  - Clear entry (START) and goal (GOAL) markers at appropriate locations
  - Square figure format is ideal for circular maze visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Ring width of 0.15 creates somewhat narrow passages that may be challenging for
    pen solving
  - The figsize of (12, 12) at 300 dpi produces 3600x3600 which is valid but could
    use the larger 16:9 format for more detail
  - No visual differentiation between difficulty levels mentioned in spec (easy/medium/hard
    passage density)
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings
    on a white background. The maze features black walls forming ring-shaped corridors
    divided into sectors, with more sectors in outer rings (8 inner to 32 outer).
    At the center is a bright yellow circle with "GOAL" text in black. The entry point
    is marked "START" in blue text at the bottom outer edge of the maze. The title
    "maze-circular · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text. The
    maze uses Prim's algorithm for generation, ensuring connectivity with exactly
    one solution path. The layout is square (12x12 inches) with balanced whitespace
    margins. Walls are consistently thick (2.5 linewidth) and suitable for pen/pencil
    solving. The overall aesthetic is clean and print-friendly.

        comment: Good use of matplotlib.patches.Arc for curved walls, plt.Circle for
          goal marker, but could leverage PathPatch for more complex path rendering
