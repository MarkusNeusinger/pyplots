review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of step function with clear horizontal and vertical transitions
  - Realistic server load scenario that demonstrates the plot type well
  - Perfect text sizing and legibility at target resolution
  - Good use of markers to highlight actual data points on the step line
  - Clean color scheme (Python blue/yellow) with good colorblind accessibility
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - sns.set_style("whitegrid") is called after figure creation, which may not apply
    the style correctly (should be called before plt.subplots)
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features - the implementation relies heavily on
    matplotlib drawstyle parameter passed through seaborn
