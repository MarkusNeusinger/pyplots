review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all box plot components (median, quartiles, whiskers,
    outliers)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each category
  - Proper 1.5*IQR whisker calculation with outliers displayed separately
  - Clean separation of box series and outlier scatter series
  - Good use of highcharts-core Python API with proper container specification
  - Data shows meaningful variation across groups demonstrating all box plot features
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Category, Value) - could use more contextual labels like
    Department and Score
  - Legend shows Distribution and Outliers which is functional but takes up space
    without adding much value for this simple plot
