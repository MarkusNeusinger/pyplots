review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native errorbar series type with proper caps/whiskers
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow Python colors)
  - Good realistic financial forecasting scenario with appropriate asymmetry
  - Proper inclusion of highcharts-more.js for errorbar support
  - Clear legend explaining what the asymmetric bounds represent (10th-90th percentile)
  - Subtitle provides context for the confidence interval interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Library version shows as "unknown" in the header comment (minor metadata issue)
  image_description: The plot displays a quarterly sales forecast with asymmetric
    error bars on a white background. Six data points (Q1 2024 through Q2 2025) are
    shown as yellow diamond markers with blue outlines, positioned along the x-axis
    by quarter. Each point has a blue vertical error bar extending asymmetrically
    above and below, with visible horizontal caps (whiskers) at both ends. The title
    "errorbar-asymmetric · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at top center in bold,
    with a subtitle explaining the 10th-90th percentile confidence intervals. The
    y-axis shows "Sales Forecast (Million USD)" ranging from ~10.5 to 24, and the
    x-axis shows "Quarter". A legend in the upper-right corner identifies "Point Estimate"
    (diamond) and "10th-90th Percentile Range" (blue line). The layout is clean with
    good use of canvas space and subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Diamond markers are well-sized and visible. Error bars have good
          stem width and visible caps. Markers could be slightly larger for optimal
          visibility.

        comment: Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins. Plot area uses
          space well, though legend positioning slightly compact.

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate. Legend is functional but could have
          slightly better symbol representation.
