review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and data elements
  - Clear demonstration of asymmetric error bars with larger downside risk
  - Good use of caption to explain what the error bars represent (as spec recommends)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial forecasting scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Error bar asymmetry pattern is uniform (all bars have larger downside) - mixing
    in some with larger upside would better demonstrate the concept
  - 'Grid/legend scoring: caption is good but a proper legend entry could enhance
    clarity'
  image_description: 'The plot displays 6 quarterly data points (Q1 2024 through Q2
    2025) on a clean white background with a subtle gray grid. Each point is marked
    with a solid blue circle (#306998) with asymmetric error bars extending above
    and below. The error bars have horizontal caps at both ends. The downside error
    bars are visibly larger than the upside bars, correctly representing conservative
    financial projections with greater downside risk. The title "errorbar-asymmetric
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The y-axis is labeled "Revenue
    (Million USD)" and the x-axis is labeled "Quarter". A caption at the bottom right
    explains: "Error bars show 10th-90th percentile forecast range".'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar (aes, geom_errorbar, geom_point, theme_minimal,

          or scales
  verdict: APPROVED
