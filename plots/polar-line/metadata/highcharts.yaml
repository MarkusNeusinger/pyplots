review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of monthly temperature data to demonstrate cyclical polar line
    visualization
  - Clear visual contrast between continental and oceanic climate patterns
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue and yellow)
  - Good text sizing throughout for the 3600x3600 canvas
  - Polygon grid interpolation creates a clean spider-web style grid
  - Different marker symbols (circle vs diamond) enhance series differentiation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned too far from the chart with excessive whitespace between
    the chart area and the legend
  - The Y-axis title appears rotated/sideways in the center which is slightly awkward
    to read
