review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visual presentation with well-proportioned bars and spacing
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business scenario (quarterly revenue by product line) that clearly demonstrates
    grouped bar comparison
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Simple, maintainable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend order (alphabetical: Hardware, Services, Software) does not match the
    visual bar order, causing slight confusion when reading the chart'
  - 'Two shades of blue (dark #306998 and light #4B8BBE) could be harder to distinguish
    for colorblind users; consider using more distinct hues'
  - Does not leverage plotnine-specific features like scale_fill_brewer for built-in
    colorblind-safe palettes
