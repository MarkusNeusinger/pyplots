review:
  strengths:
  - Explosion effect is clearly visible with R&D (0.3) and Sales (0.2) noticeably
    separated
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color
  - Percentage labels are well-formatted and positioned on each slice
  - White stroke between slices provides good visual separation
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with meaningful data
  - Proper use of lets-plot geom_pie with explode aesthetic
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Pie chart is slightly left-of-center due to legend placement
  image_description: 'The plot shows an exploded pie chart with 6 department budget
    segments on a white background. The title "pie-exploded · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The pie chart displays: R&D (green, 32.0%) and Sales
    (orange, 20.0%) as exploded/separated slices, with Marketing (blue, 18.0%), Operations
    (yellow, 15.0%), HR (purple, 8.0%), and IT (light blue, 7.0%) as non-exploded
    slices. Each slice has a white percentage label. A legend titled "Department"
    appears on the right side listing all categories with colored dots. The chart
    uses distinct, colorblind-friendly colors with white stroke separating slices.'
