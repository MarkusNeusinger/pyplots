review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with clear, properly sized Unicode chess pieces
  - Perfect board orientation following chess standards (white at bottom, light square
    at h1)
  - Scholar's Mate is an excellent educational example position
  - Clean code structure with well-organized constants
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  - Appropriate square aspect ratio for chess board
  weaknesses:
  - Could add hover tooltips to show piece names when hovering over pieces
  - The PIECE_SYMBOLS dictionary could be more compact
  image_description: The plot displays a chess board visualizing Scholar's Mate position.
    The board uses traditional colors with tan/beige (#F0D9B5) for light squares and
    brown (#B58863) for dark squares. The 8×8 grid is properly oriented with white
    at the bottom (ranks 1-2) and black at the top (ranks 7-8). File labels (a-h)
    appear below the board and rank labels (1-8) on the left side. Chess pieces are
    rendered using Unicode symbols in black color - white pieces shown as outlined
    symbols (♔♕♖♗♘♙) and black pieces as filled symbols (♚♛♜♝♞♟). The white queen
    on f7 delivers checkmate to the black king on h8. The title "Scholar's Mate ·
    chessboard-pieces · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A dark border frames
    the board. The square aspect ratio is appropriate for a chess board diagram.
