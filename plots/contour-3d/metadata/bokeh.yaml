review:
  strengths:
  - Creative 3D projection implementation using painter's algorithm for depth sorting
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's ColorBar, HoverTool, and HTML export features
  - Clean isometric projection with custom axis arrows
  - Base plane contour projection provides good reference per spec requirements
  - Viridis colormap is accessible and perceptually uniform
  weaknesses:
  - Text elements (title, axis labels, colorbar) appear small relative to the high-resolution
    output
  - Uses deprecated matplotlib allsegs API; should use get_paths() for future compatibility
  - Axis labels lack descriptive context (just X, Y, Z instead of meaningful variable
    names with units)
  - Layout leaves significant white space at the bottom of the canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D contour surface visualization using an
    isometric projection technique. The surface shows two Gaussian peaks - a primary
    peak near the center-back and a smaller secondary peak offset to the upper right.
    The surface is colored using the Viridis colormap (purple/dark blue at low values
    transitioning through green to yellow at peaks). Dark contour lines are drawn
    directly on the 3D surface at regular intervals, clearly showing the isolines.
    Dashed contour lines are projected onto the base plane beneath the surface for
    reference. Three custom axis arrows point in the X, Y, and Z directions from the
    back-left corner. A colorbar on the right displays "Height (Z)" ranging from approximately
    0.2 to 1.0. The title "contour-3d · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.
