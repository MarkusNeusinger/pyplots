quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with plant growth across fertilizer treatments showing
    clear differentiation between groups
  - Proper use of geom_jitter with appropriate width parameter to prevent point overlap
  - Clean, publication-quality appearance with well-chosen text sizes and minimal
    theme
  - Smart decision to hide legend since categories are already on x-axis
  - Good use of outliers in Complete group to demonstrate data variation
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for enhanced data exploration
  - Grid lines only on y-axis (x grid disabled) which is appropriate but minor grid
    could add depth
