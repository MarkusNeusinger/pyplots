quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent jitter implementation using XY chart with calculated x-positions
  - Clean, professional color scheme with four distinct, accessible colors
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic business context (department performance scores)
  - Good distribution variation showing different spreads and an outlier
  - Well-configured custom Style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Performance Score (%)" if percentages)
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (current alpha via style is acceptable but
    could improve)
