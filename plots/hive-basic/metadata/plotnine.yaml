review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of a hive plot using plotnine basic geoms (segments and
    points) since plotnine has no native network/hive plot support
  - Excellent use of Bezier curves for edge visualization with appropriate curvature
    for same-axis vs cross-axis connections
  - Well-chosen software dependency network example that clearly demonstrates the
    hive plot concept
  - Good color scheme with colorblind-accessible palette (blue, yellow, teal)
  - Node sizing by degree adds meaningful information encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels on the UTILITY axis have some crowding (crypto, parser, validator)
    making them harder to read
  - The plot occupies the upper portion of the canvas with significant whitespace
    at the bottom
  - Node positioning along axes uses index rather than a meaningful metric like degree
    (spec suggests degree-based positioning)
