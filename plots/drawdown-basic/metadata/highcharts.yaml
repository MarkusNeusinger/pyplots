review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent gradient fill creates visual depth showing drawdown severity
  - Zero baseline with Peak (0%) label clearly marks reference point
  - 'Statistics displayed in subtitle (Max Drawdown: -22.2%, Recovery: 164 days)'
  - Clean datetime axis with quarterly tick intervals
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML versions generated
  - Professional typography with appropriately scaled fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit marker or annotation at the maximum drawdown point (spec requests
    highlighting max drawdown period)
  - Red color choice noted in library rules as potentially problematic for colorblind
    accessibility (though single-series mitigates impact)
  - Legend could use larger text size relative to chart dimensions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart spanning from January 2022
    to late 2023 (approximately 2 years of data). The chart shows percentage decline
    from peak value on the Y-axis (ranging from +5% to -24%) and dates on the X-axis.
    The drawdown values are represented by a red area chart (#DC2626 red color) with
    a gradient fill that becomes more opaque toward the bottom. A blue horizontal
    line at 0% marks the peak reference baseline with a "Peak (0%)" label on the right
    side. The title "drawdown-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in bold, with a subtitle showing "Max Drawdown: -22.2% | Recovery: 164 days".
    The chart shows multiple drawdown periods with the maximum drawdown reaching approximately
    -22% around June 2022. Multiple recovery points (where the line touches 0%) are
    visible throughout the time series. The legend at the bottom shows "Drawdown"
    with a red indicator.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts area chart with gradient fill, datetime axis, plotLines
          for zero baseline, and interactive HTML export; could leverage more Highcharts-specific
          features like zones or data labels
