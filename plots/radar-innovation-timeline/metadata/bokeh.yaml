review:
  strengths:
  - Correct 270-degree radar layout with all spec features implemented (rings, sectors,
    labels, legend)
  - Excellent data quality with 25 realistic, recognizable technology items properly
    categorized
  - Clean ring background fills provide good visual separation of time horizons
  - Smart label positioning logic adapts text alignment based on angular position
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Bokeh's web capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Red (#E57373) and green (#4CAF50) sector colors create a red-green colorblind
    accessibility problem — replace with colorblind-safe alternatives (e.g., orange/teal)
  - Item labels at 14pt are slightly small for 3600px canvas — increase to 16-18pt
    for better readability
  - Label crowding in the Adopt ring (RAG Pipelines, K8s GitOps, LLM Agents area)
    — increase angular spacing or adjust radial jitter
  - Missing ColumnDataSource usage, which is a core Bokeh idiom
  - No visual hierarchy or emphasis to guide the viewer — consider varying marker
    sizes by ring or adding subtle annotations for key items
  - Ring labels could be more prominent — currently easy to miss in italic gray
  image_description: 'The plot displays an innovation radar chart on a 3600×3600 white
    canvas using a 270-degree (three-quarter circle) layout. Four concentric rings
    represent time horizons: Adopt (innermost), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost),
    each with subtle background fills in light blue-gray, light gray, warm cream,
    and faint pink tones. Four angular sectors divide the radar: AI & ML (blue, #306998,
    top), Cloud & Infra (coral/red, #E57373, left), Sustainability (green, #4CAF50,
    bottom-left), and Biotech (purple, #9C27B0, bottom-right). Sector headers appear
    in bold colored text along the outer edge. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess,
    Hold) are shown in italic gray text along the starting radial boundary. 25 technology
    items are placed as colored circular markers with adjacent text labels (e.g.,
    "LLM Agents", "CRISPR Diagnostics", "Fusion Energy"). The upper-right 90-degree
    gap is left open. A legend on the right side lists all four sectors with matching
    colored markers. The title "radar-innovation-timeline · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top.'
