review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents text overlap
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate marker sizes and connector lines
  - Well-chosen color palette with distinct colors for each project phase
  - Proper use of seaborn scatterplot with hue parameter for categorical coloring
  - Good realistic data scenario (software project milestones) that demonstrates timeline
    use case
  - Legend placement and styling is well-executed with horizontal layout
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are missing (though dates on x-axis are self-explanatory for a timeline)
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features; most visualization logic uses matplotlib
    directly
  - Red and green colors used together may cause issues for red-green colorblind users
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization for a
    software development project spanning January 2024 to March 2025. Nine milestones
    are shown as large circular markers on a gray horizontal axis. Labels alternate
    above and below the axis (e.g., "Project Kickoff" and "Architecture Design" above;
    "Requirements Done" and "UI Mockups" below) connected by vertical colored lines.
    Five project phases are color-coded: blue (Planning), yellow (Design), green (Development),
    red (Testing), and purple (Deployment). The legend appears at the bottom center
    with all five phase categories in a horizontal row. Date labels on the x-axis
    are rotated 45 degrees showing bi-monthly intervals. The title "timeline-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with hue/palette correctly, but timeline is
          primarily matplotlib-based with seaborn for the scatter points only
  verdict: APPROVED
