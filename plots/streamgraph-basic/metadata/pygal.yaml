review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements a centered streamgraph using pygal StackedLine chart with
    mathematical baseline shifting
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with high contrast between adjacent layers (dark
    blue, orange, teal, crimson, gold)
  - Smooth flowing curves achieved through cubic interpolation
  - Realistic data scenario with seasonal patterns and genre trends
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels are truncated showing Jan... instead of full Jan 23 labels despite
    truncate_label=-1 setting
  - Y-axis label includes (centered) which is a technical detail not a meaningful
    unit
  - Grid lines are not visible in the output despite configuration
