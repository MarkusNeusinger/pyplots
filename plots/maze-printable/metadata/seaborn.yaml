review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn heatmap function to render the maze grid efficiently
  - Clean black-and-white design optimized for printing as specified
  - DFS algorithm properly implemented ensuring a single solution path
  - Good use of seaborn styling (set_style, set_context, despine) for clean output
  - Start/Goal markers are visually distinct with contrasting colors
  - Square aspect ratio is perfect for maze puzzles
  weaknesses:
  - Start (S) and Goal (G) markers could be slightly larger relative to passage width
    for better visibility when printed
  - Figure size (12x12) could be increased to better match the 3600x3600 target resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 cell rectangular maze puzzle with black
    walls on a white background. The title "maze-printable · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. The start position is marked with a blue
    circle containing a white "S" in the top-left corner of the maze. The goal position
    is marked with a yellow/gold circle containing a black "G" in the bottom-right
    corner. The maze is algorithmically generated using DFS and shows consistent wall
    thickness throughout. The design is clean and print-friendly with high contrast
    black-and-white passages and walls. The maze fills the square canvas well with
    adequate margins.
