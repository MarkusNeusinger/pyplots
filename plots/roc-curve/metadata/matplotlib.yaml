review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized lines (linewidth=3.5) and readable
    text at all sizes
  - Three models demonstrating different performance levels (excellent, good, fair)
    provides comprehensive feature coverage
  - Proper inclusion of diagonal reference line for random classifier baseline
  - AUC values displayed prominently in legend with proper formatting
  - Good use of fill_between to emphasize area under curves
  - Colorblind-accessible color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions (compute_roc and compute_auc) which violates the
    KISS principle - should be inline computation or use sklearn
  - Legend placement in lower right corner slightly crowds the curve convergence area
  - Axis labels lack explicit mention that these are rates/proportions (though standard
    for ROC curves)
  image_description: 'The plot displays three ROC curves comparing classifier performance:
    Random Forest (blue, AUC=0.98), Logistic Regression (yellow/gold, AUC=0.91), and
    Decision Tree (green, AUC=0.66). A dashed gray diagonal line represents the random
    classifier baseline (AUC=0.50). The blue curve has a light blue filled area beneath
    it. The x-axis shows "False Positive Rate" (0.0-1.0) and the y-axis shows "True
    Positive Rate" (0.0-1.0). The title reads "roc-curve · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. A legend is positioned in the lower right corner. The background has
    a subtle grid with dashed lines.'

        comment: Uses fill_between for area under curve which is a nice matplotlib
          feature, but could have used more advanced features like annotations or
          custom styling
  verdict: APPROVED
