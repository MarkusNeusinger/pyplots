review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating above/below layout prevents text overlap and creates clear
    visual hierarchy
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for timeline visualization
  - Creative SVG injection to add dashed timeline axis as visual anchor
  - Realistic software project milestone data with meaningful categories
  - Color-coded categories with distinct, accessible colors
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical canvas utilization could be improved - timeline occupies narrow horizontal
    band with large empty areas above and below
  - Legend placement at bottom left is distant from the actual data points
