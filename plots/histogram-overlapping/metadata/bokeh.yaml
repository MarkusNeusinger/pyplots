review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of aligned bins across all three distributions for accurate comparison
  - Proper semi-transparent fills (alpha 0.5) allowing overlapping regions to be clearly
    visible
  - Well-chosen contrasting colors (blue, yellow, green) for the three departments
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful variation between groups
  - Includes interactive tools and HTML export leveraging Bokeh strengths
  - Text sizes appropriately scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning leaves excessive whitespace on the right side of the plot
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
  - HoverTool could be customized to show bin range and count information
  image_description: 'The plot displays three overlapping histograms showing employee
    response times (in milliseconds) by department. The Engineering distribution (blue,
    #306998) is centered around 250ms with moderate spread. The Sales distribution
    (yellow/gold, #FFD43B) is centered around 320ms with wider spread, showing some
    values extending to 600ms. The Support distribution (green, #4CAF50) is centered
    around 280ms with tighter spread. All three histograms use semi-transparent fills
    (alpha 0.5) allowing overlapping regions to be visible. The title "histogram-overlapping
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. Axis labels show "Response Time
    (ms)" on x-axis and "Frequency" on y-axis. A legend in the top right identifies
    all three departments. The grid uses subtle dashed lines. Interactive Bokeh toolbar
    is visible in the top right corner.'

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.3, dashed), but legend is placed in top-right
          with excessive empty space on the right side of the plot; legend could be
          positioned better

        comment: Uses Bokeh's quad glyph appropriately, includes interactive tools
          (pan, wheel_zoom, box_zoom, reset, hover), exports both PNG and HTML. Could
          leverage ColumnDataSource or HoverTool customization for richer interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
