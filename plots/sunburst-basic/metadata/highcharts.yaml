review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple) with brightness
    variations for hierarchy levels
  - Well-structured hierarchical data representing a realistic corporate budget breakdown
    scenario
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - 'Effective use of Highcharts sunburst-specific features: level configurations,
    color variations, label rotation modes'
  - Good canvas utilization with the chart filling most of the available space
  - Clear visual separation between hierarchy levels through color brightness
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring labels on smaller segments are difficult to read due to rotation
    and font size
  - Library version shows as unknown in the file header instead of actual version
    number
