review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn pairplot function, which is specifically designed for
    scatter matrices
  - Iris-like data is a perfect, realistic example that demonstrates species clustering
    and correlations
  - Clean implementation with appropriate sizing and transparency for the data density
  - KDE plots on diagonal with fill provide good visual distribution representation
  - Title format and axis labels with units are correct
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses two similar blues (Setosa and Virginica) which could be confusing;
    consider using three more distinct colors
  - Accessing private attribute g._legend is not ideal; consider using legend_data
    parameter or seaborn move_legend function
  - Marker size (s=80) could be slightly smaller given the data density in some cells
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (pairplot) showing
    pairwise relationships between four iris-like variables: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal
    Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). The diagonal shows kernel
    density estimates (KDE) with filled distributions for each variable. Three species
    (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) are color-coded using a blue, yellow, and lighter
    blue palette. Scatter points have white edge outlines and appropriate transparency.
    The title "scatter-matrix · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold.
    A legend for species is positioned on the right side. Axis labels include units
    (cm) and are clearly readable. The grid uses a subtle whitegrid style.'

        comment: Title is large and bold, axis labels are readable with units, tick
          labels are appropriately sized. Slightly smaller than optimal for some tick
          values.

        comment: Uses seaborn's pairplot which is ideal for this task, with KDE diagonals
          and hue coloring. Could have used corner=True for more compact display or
          regression lines.
  verdict: APPROVED
