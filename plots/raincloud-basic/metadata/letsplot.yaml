review:
  strengths:
  - 'Correct raincloud metaphor: cloud (half-violin) above, boxplot centered, rain
    (jitter) below for each category'
  - 'Excellent use of lets-plot distinctive features: show_half parameter, rich interactive
    tooltips with layer_tooltips chaining, flavor system'
  - Well-chosen realistic data scenario with three meaningfully different distributions
    including bimodal Treatment B
  - All text sizes explicitly set for 4800x2700px output
  - Clean, idiomatic grammar-of-graphics code structure
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations highlighting that Treatment A shows faster
    responses, or that Treatment B has a bimodal pattern with two response clusters'
  - Box plots are too narrow (width=0.1) making quartile/median information hard to
    read — increase to 0.15-0.2
  - 'Canvas utilization could improve: reduce vertical spacing between groups or add
    visual elements to fill the whitespace'
  - Consider making the bimodal nature of Treatment B more visually dramatic by adjusting
    the generation parameters
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction Time
    (ms) on the x-axis ranging from approximately 200 to 700ms. Each condition has
    three visual layers: a half-violin (cloud) extending above the category baseline
    showing the distribution shape, a narrow white box plot centered on the baseline
    showing quartiles and median, and jittered scatter points (rain) falling below
    the baseline. Colors are blue (#306998) for Control, yellow (#FFD43B) for Treatment
    A, and green (#5BA85B) for Treatment B. The violins are filled with transparency
    (alpha 0.7). Control is centered around 450ms, Treatment A around 380ms, and Treatment
    B shows a wider spread suggesting its bimodal nature though the bimodality is
    not extremely pronounced visually. The title reads "raincloud-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top left. A legend sits in the upper right corner.
    The background is light with subtle vertical gridlines on the x-axis only. The
    layout uses a 16:9 aspect ratio with generous vertical spacing between categories.'
