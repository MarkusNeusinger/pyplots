review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive tools (WheelZoom, BoxZoom, PanTool, ResetTool)
    with wheel zoom as default active scroll
  - Well-configured HoverTool with vline mode and formatted date/temperature display
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with readable fonts throughout
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data pattern demonstrating time series characteristics
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper ColumnDataSource usage
  - Dual output (HTML for interactivity, PNG for preview) is best practice for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top_left overlaps with data peaks in winter months - consider
    top_right or outside placement
  - Missing RangeSlider or RangeTool widget for quick time range navigation as specified
    in requirements
  - Marker size could be reduced to 6-8 with alpha 0.6 for 365 data points to reduce
    visual clutter
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive line chart showing daily temperature
    readings over a full year (January 2024 to January 2025). The line is rendered
    in Python Blue (#306998) with small circular markers at each data point that have
    a yellow border. The chart shows a clear seasonal sinusoidal pattern with temperatures
    ranging from approximately -5°C in winter to ~35°C in summer. The title "line-interactive
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in blue at the top left. The y-axis is labeled "Temperature
    (°C)" and the x-axis is labeled "Date". A legend box labeled "Daily Temperature"
    is positioned in the upper left. The background is light gray (#FAFAFA) with subtle
    dashed grid lines. The bokeh toolbar with zoom/pan controls is visible on the
    right edge.

        comment: Good use of ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with custom tooltips, interactive
          tools (WheelZoom, BoxZoom, Pan, Reset). Could leverage RangeSlider widget
          for enhanced navigation per spec.
  verdict: APPROVED
