review:
  strengths:
  - Correct circular maze structure with 7 concentric rings
  - Entry point clearly marked with blue arrow on outer edge
  - Goal/finish marked with red star at center
  - Proper use of Kruskal algorithm for maze generation
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced layout
  - Correct title format
  - Print-friendly black walls on white background
  weaknesses:
  - Maze walls appear chaotic with many overlapping/intersecting line segments making
    paths difficult to trace
  - The rendering approach creates visual noise - lines appear to cross inappropriately
  - Entry arrow is somewhat small relative to the maze
  - Title font size could be larger for the canvas dimensions
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle on a white background
    with black walls. The maze consists of 7 concentric rings with radial walls creating
    sectors. The outer boundary is complete except for a single entry gap on the right
    side, marked with a blue arrow pointing inward. At the center, there is a red
    star shape indicating the goal. The title "maze-circular · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in small gray text. The walls are thick black lines forming
    the maze pathways. However, the visual appearance is chaotic with many line segments
    appearing to overlap and intersect inappropriately, making it difficult to trace
    valid paths through the maze.
