review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data choice with Pacific Northwest rainfall pattern showing
    clear seasonal variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct title format
  - Good color accessibility with single blue shade
  - Acknowledges pygal limitations for rose charts in comments
  - Clockwise month arrangement with January at top follows conventions
  weaknesses:
  - 'Wrong chart type: Creates a radar/spider chart (connected polygon) instead of
    a rose/coxcomb chart (wedge-shaped segments with equal angles and radii proportional
    to values)'
  - Legend placement is poor - isolated in bottom-left corner with excessive whitespace
  - Chart does not utilize canvas space efficiently
