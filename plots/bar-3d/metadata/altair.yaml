review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution to simulate 3D in a 2D library using isometric projection with
    multiple rect faces per bar
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with opacity variation for shading effect
  - Well-structured painter's algorithm approach (sorting by depth) ensures proper
    occlusion
  - Good tooltip implementation for interactivity in the HTML output
  - Clear labeling with product names and quarter indicators
  weaknesses:
  - The 3D simulation, while creative, results in some visual artifacts where bar
    faces don't perfectly align
  - Y-axis shows Relative Height which is abstract - would benefit from showing actual
    sales values
  - Quarter labels positioned on the right could be more integrated into the 3D perspective
  - Missing Altair's .interactive() feature for zoom/pan which would allow better
    exploration
