review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text readability with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Clean, professional design with removed top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Value labels above bars enhance data communication
  - Realistic product sales scenario with plausible dollar amounts
  - Proper use of matplotlib Axes API (ax.bar, ax.annotate, ax.set_*)
  weaknesses:
  - Data is sorted in descending order which is less visually interesting than a mixed
    arrangement showing natural category variation
  - Could use matplotlib FuncFormatter for y-axis tick labels to show dollar signs
    consistently
