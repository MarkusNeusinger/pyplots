review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_sina which is lets-plot native swarm/beeswarm geometry
  - Thoughtful data generation with different distribution shapes (normal, wide spread,
    bimodal, outliers) showcasing swarm plot capabilities
  - Clean mean markers using geom_crossbar that do not obscure individual points
  - Appropriate point sizing and alpha for the data density (~175 points)
  - 'Proper use of lets-plot idioms: ggsize for dimensions, scale=3 for high-resolution
    output'
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Performance Score could include units or scale indication like Performance
    Score (0-100)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm (sina) plot showing Performance Scores
    across four departments: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales (green),
    and Support (red/crimson). Individual data points are spread horizontally to avoid
    overlap, creating the characteristic beeswarm pattern. Each department shows a
    different distribution shape - Engineering has a tight cluster around 80, Marketing
    shows wider spread with some low outliers, Sales displays a bimodal pattern with
    clusters around 65 and 90, and Support has a moderate spread with visible outliers
    at the low end (around 45-48). Black horizontal crossbars indicate the mean score
    for each department. The title correctly reads "swarm-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai".
    The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle gray horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: geom_sina is the lets-plot equivalent of swarm/beeswarm, uses scale_color_manual/scale_fill_manual,
          theme customization, crossbar for means
  verdict: APPROVED
