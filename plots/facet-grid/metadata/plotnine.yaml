review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of facet_grid for 2D faceting (rows and columns) demonstrating plotnine
    grammar of graphics strength
  - Well-designed realistic plant growth experiment scenario with meaningful condition
    differences
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good color palette with colorblind-accessible colors
  - Appropriate text sizing for all elements following the library guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines not visible in panels despite theme_minimal - panels appear empty except
    for data points
  - 'Redundant color encoding: Light Condition is shown both by facet column AND point
    color'
  - Legend shows Light Condition but each column already represents one Light Condition
    making it partially redundant
