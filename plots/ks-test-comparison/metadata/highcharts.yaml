review:
  strengths:
  - 'Complete spec compliance: all required features present including ECDFs, K-S
    statistic, max divergence highlight, p-value, and proper legend'
  - Effective use of Highcharts annotations module with callout shape, shadow, and
    connector for the max divergence point
  - 'Strong data storytelling: subtitle narrates the statistical conclusion, annotation
    provides focal point, plot band guides visual attention'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good luminance contrast between blue and orange
  - Clean code structure with proper seed, realistic credit scoring scenario, and
    both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has unused whitespace on the right side — tightening margins or adjusting
    axis range could improve canvas utilization
  - Axis labels are descriptive but could include units or range context (e.g., "Credit
    Score (200–1000)")
  - The two ECDF lines rely solely on color for differentiation — adding a different
    dash style to one would improve accessibility further
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparison using
    two ECDF step functions on a light gray (#f5f6f8) background. The blue line (#306998)
    represents "Good Customers" and the orange line (#e67e22) represents "Bad Customers,"
    plotted against Credit Score (x-axis, ~200–950) and Cumulative Proportion (y-axis,
    0–1). A dark dashed vertical line near Credit Score ~620 marks the point of maximum
    divergence, with diamond-shaped markers at both endpoints of the line. A white
    callout annotation with a border and shadow reads "D = 0.7300 / Strong separation."
    A subtle light gray plot band highlights the max divergence region on the x-axis.
    The subtitle reports "K-S Statistic = 0.7300 │ p-value = 9.54e-78 │ Distributions
    are significantly different." The title follows the required format "ks-test-comparison
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold, large text. The legend is horizontally centered
    at the bottom with three entries: Good Customers, Bad Customers, and Max Distance
    (D = 0.7300). Dashed grid lines appear on the y-axis with low opacity. The overall
    layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
