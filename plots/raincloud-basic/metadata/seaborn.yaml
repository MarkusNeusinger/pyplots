review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud structure with correct cloud-right, rain-left layout matching
    spec requirements
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B effectively demonstrates the advantage of
    rainclouds over boxplots
  - Colorblind-accessible palette with good contrast between conditions
  - Realistic experimental context with appropriate reaction time values
  - Clean, readable code with proper random seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Violin clipping approach uses direct vertex manipulation rather than seaborn-native
    methods
  - Legend overlaps slightly with data points in the upper left corner
