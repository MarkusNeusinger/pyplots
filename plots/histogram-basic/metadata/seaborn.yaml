review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and well-proportioned layout
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate data range
  - Clear bin separation with white edges enhances readability
  - Title follows the exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Could showcase seaborn-specific features like KDE overlay (kde=True) to differentiate
    from matplotlib
  - Data shows only unimodal distribution; adding slight skew or outliers would better
    demonstrate histogram capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of test scores with a clear bell-curve
    (normal) distribution. The bars are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998) with
    white edges separating each bin. The x-axis shows "Test Score (points)" ranging
    from approximately 35 to 120, while the y-axis shows "Frequency (count)" ranging
    from 0 to 60. The distribution is centered around 75-80 points with the highest
    bars reaching about 59 counts. The title "histogram-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is clearly visible at the top. A subtle dashed grid is applied to the y-axis only.
    The layout is well-balanced with no overlapping elements.
