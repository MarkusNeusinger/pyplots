review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme (blue-white-red) perfectly suited for correlation
    visualization
  - Lower triangle masking reduces visual redundancy as recommended in spec
  - Clear cell annotations with proper formatting (2 decimal places)
  - Realistic financial portfolio data demonstrating varied correlation patterns
  - Proper use of coord_fixed(ratio=1) for square cells
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Title follows exact pyplots.ai format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned slightly closer to the heatmap to reduce whitespace
  - Data does not include any extreme negative correlations (below -0.35) to show
    the full range of the diverging colormap blue end
