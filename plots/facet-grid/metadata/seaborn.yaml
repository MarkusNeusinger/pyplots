review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn FacetGrid for creating a 3×4 grid layout with row and
    column faceting
  - Clean, realistic business data scenario (marketing spend vs sales revenue)
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for the data density
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Systematic variation in data relationships across regions and quarters
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label repeats on every row when shared axes could display it only once
    on the left edge
  - Could benefit from regression lines (lmplot or regplot) to highlight the varying
    relationships across facets
