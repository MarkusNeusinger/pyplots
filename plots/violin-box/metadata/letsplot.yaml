review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of violin and box plot showing both KDE density and summary
    statistics
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper layering
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with four distinct colors
  - Realistic server response time scenario with varied distributions
  - Proper font sizing following lets-plot guidelines (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Outliers clearly visible as hollow circles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is hidden (legend_position=none) - while x-axis labels work as identifiers,
    keeping a legend could add clarity
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for the HTML export
  - Bimodal distribution in Premium group is somewhat subtle, could be more pronounced
