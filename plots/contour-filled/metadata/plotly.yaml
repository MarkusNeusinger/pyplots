review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap providing colorblind-safe visualization
  - Multiple Gaussian peaks and valley demonstrate full capability of filled contours
  - Contour labels with white text provide precise value identification
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Correct aspect ratio with scaleanchor maintaining square coordinate system
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated as expected for Plotly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) without units or more descriptive
    context
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hovertemplate to show
    (x, y, z) values on interaction
