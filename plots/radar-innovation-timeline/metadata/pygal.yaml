review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, amber, teal, purple) with strong visual distinction
    between sectors
  - Comprehensive, realistic technology data covering 24 innovations across 4 sectors
    and 4 time horizons
  - Clean, well-structured code with smart slot-based angular layout for positioning
    items within sectors
  - Good use of pygal major/minor label distinction to differentiate sector headers
    from innovation names
  weaknesses:
  - Connecting lines between data points create confusing polygon shapes — an innovation
    radar should show independent plotted points, not connected spider chart polygons
    (pygal limitation)
  - Minor x-labels (innovation names) at 18pt are too small and heavily rotated, reducing
    readability around the perimeter
  - Full 360-degree layout used instead of the spec-suggested half-circle or three-quarter
    layout that would leave room for legend/title area
  - No background fill per ring to visually separate time horizons as suggested by
    the spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/spider chart on a square canvas with
    a white background and light gray (#f4f5fa) plot area. Four colored series represent
    thematic sectors: AI & ML (blue, #2563eb), Cloud & Infra (amber/orange, #d97706),
    Sustainability (teal, #0d9488), and Biotech & Health (purple, #7c3aed). Concentric
    ring guides are visible as subtle gray circles, with ring labels "Adopt", "Trial",
    "Assess", and "Hold" displayed along one radial axis (innermost to outermost).
    Innovation names (e.g., "LLM Agents", "Kubernetes", "Green Software", "mRNA Therapeutics")
    appear as rotated minor labels around the perimeter, while sector headers ("AI
    & ML", "Cloud & Infra", "Sustainability", "Biotech & Health") are shown in larger
    bold text as major labels at cardinal positions. Each series connects its data
    points with lines forming polygon shapes, with filled dots (size 16) at each data
    point. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all four sector categories with
    colored squares. The title "radar-innovation-timeline · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top.'
