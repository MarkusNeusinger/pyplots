review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using plotnine grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_segment
    + geom_point)
  - Good color scheme with meaningful route type coding (blue=Express, yellow=Regional,
    red=Airport, green=Local)
  - Effective use of arrow() for direction indication on edges
  - Well-implemented edge offset calculation to separate overlapping routes
  - Appropriate use of theme_void() for network visualization
  - Realistic transport network data with meaningful station names and schedules
  weaknesses:
  - Edge labels near Central-East routes overlap slightly due to multiple routes on
    same path
  - Edge label font size (8pt) is somewhat small compared to other text elements
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a static transport network diagram showing 12 stations (nodes) connected by directed routes (edges). Stations are rendered as white circles with blue outlines (size=12, stroke=2), labeled with names like "Central", "North", "South", "East", "West", "Airport", "University", "Industrial", "Northeast", "Northwest", "Southeast", and "Southwest" in bold gray text positioned above each node.

    Directed edges show travel connections with color-coded route types:
    - Blue (#306998) for Express routes (RE1-RE4)
    - Yellow (#FFD43B) for Regional routes (RB1-RB4)
    - Red (#E74C3C) for Airport Express (AE1)
    - Green (#27AE60) for Local/S-Bahn routes (S1-S2)

    Each route displays a label with route ID and departure/arrival times in the format "RE1 | 06:30→06:55". The edges have arrowheads (closed type, angle=25) indicating travel direction. Multiple routes between the same stations are offset perpendicular to the route line to prevent complete overlap.

    The title "network-transport-static · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in 24pt bold text. A legend on the right side identifies the four route types with colored lines and labels (Airport, Regional, Express, Local).

    The overall layout uses theme_void() for a clean presentation without axes, utilizing the full 16x9 canvas with the network centered and well-distributed across the available space. The geographic positioning places Central at the hub with peripheral stations arranged logically.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_segment, geom_point, geom_text, arrow(),
          scale_color_manual, theme_void; network diagrams aren't plotnine's primary
          strength but implementation is solid
