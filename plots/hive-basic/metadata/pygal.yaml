review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hive plot structure with 3 clear radial axes at 120-degree separation
  - Creative use of Bezier curves for edge bundling with different curve intensity
    for same-axis vs cross-axis edges
  - Good color differentiation with semi-transparent edges grouped by source axis
  - Comprehensive software module dependency example with realistic node labels and
    degrees
  - Proper interactive SVG/HTML output alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Legend has redundant entries showing both axis names (Core, Utility, Interface)
    and module group names (Core Modules, etc.) - could consolidate
  - Axis endpoint labels are represented as tiny dots rather than visible text labels
    identifying each axis on the plot itself
  - The small axis label markers at the endpoints are barely visible compared to the
    main data nodes
