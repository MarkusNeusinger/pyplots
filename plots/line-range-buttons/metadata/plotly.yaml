review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all required range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD,
    1Y, All)
  - Active button highlighting works correctly with custom activecolor
  - Range slider provides additional manual date selection capability
  - Proper hover template with formatted date and value
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Appropriate font sizes for 4800×2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Value lacks units or more specific context (e.g., Price ($) or Stock
    Value)
  - Grid could have slightly higher alpha (0.1 is very subtle, 0.2-0.3 might improve
    readability)
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart spanning from January
    2022 to late 2024, showing approximately 3 years of daily price data. The line
    is rendered in a blue color (#306998) with appropriate width. The chart features
    range selector buttons at the top-left (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, All) with the "All"
    button currently highlighted in blue, indicating the active selection. A range
    slider is visible at the bottom of the chart for manual date range selection.
    The y-axis shows "Value" ranging from ~80 to ~220, and the x-axis shows "Date"
    with tick marks at January and July of each year. The title "line-range-buttons
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The data shows realistic stock-like
    behavior with volatility, ranging from ~80 at the low point to peaks above 210.
