review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Gaussian kernel with Silverman's rule
    for bandwidth selection
  - Creative approach using XY chart to draw custom violin shapes since pygal lacks
    native violin support
  - Good visual distinction between categories with colorblind-safe palette
  - 'Complete box plot components: median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers all present'
  - Proper legend entries distinguish between categories and statistical components
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range extends to 140 despite data being clipped to 0-100, wasting vertical
    space
  - Legend mixes category names with box plot element names, creating visual complexity
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots representing Performance
    Scores (0-100 scale) across four departments: Engineering (blue, #306998), Marketing
    (yellow, #FFD43B), Sales (green, #4CAF50), and Operations (orange, #FF5722). Each
    violin shows the KDE distribution shape with an embedded white box plot showing
    the IQR (Q1-Q3). Gray horizontal lines indicate medians, and vertical whiskers
    extend to the data bounds. Black dots represent outliers (visible for Engineering
    at ~53, ~115, ~118 and Marketing at ~14, ~143). The title "violin-box · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" is at the top. X-axis shows "Department" with labels, Y-axis shows
    "Performance Score (0-100 scale)" ranging from 0 to 140. A legend appears on the
    left side listing Engineering, IQR Box, Whiskers, Median Line, Outliers, Marketing,
    Sales, and Operations with corresponding color markers.'

        comment: Legend is cluttered with too many entries (some labeled "None" entries
          may appear). The legend organization could be cleaner.

        comment: Uses pygal's XY chart with custom Style, fill and stroke options,
          legend positioning. Manual KDE implementation is necessary but not a library
          distinctive feature.
  verdict: APPROVED
