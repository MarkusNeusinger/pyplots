quality_score: 94
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean implementation of mean bias and limits of agreement as separate series with
    meaningful labels
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate data distribution
  - Good color differentiation between measurements, mean line, and LoA boundaries
  - Proper use of ddof=1 for sample standard deviation calculation
  weaknesses:
  - LoA values annotated only in legend, not directly on the plot as text annotations
    (spec requests annotations on the plot)
