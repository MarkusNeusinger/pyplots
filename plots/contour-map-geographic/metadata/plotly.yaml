review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data simulation with latitude gradient, Gulf Stream effect,
    and natural variation
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with good use of Plotly graph objects
  - Well-labeled contour lines with appropriate 2°C intervals
  - Good use of RdYlBu_r colormap appropriate for temperature data (red=warm, blue=cold)
  - Includes interactive HTML export leveraging Plotly interactivity strength
  - Custom hover template provides useful coordinate and value information
  weaknesses:
  - Missing actual geographic basemap with coastlines/borders - annotations used instead
    of geographic base layer
  - Title includes extra descriptive prefix beyond standard format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour map of North Atlantic Sea
    Surface Temperature covering the region from 30°N to 60°N latitude and -60° to
    0° longitude. The visualization uses a RdYlBu (reversed) colormap with warm red/orange
    tones for higher temperatures (up to ~22°C in the south) transitioning through
    yellow to cool blue tones for lower temperatures (~6°C in the north). Contour
    lines are drawn at 2°C intervals with white labels (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,
    20, 22) visible along the isolines. The plot includes geographic reference annotations
    for "Newfoundland", "Ireland", and "Azores" in gray text. The title follows the
    correct format: "North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature · contour-map-geographic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai". Axis labels show "Longitude" and "Latitude" with appropriate
    degree symbols and °N suffix for latitude. A vertical colorbar on the right displays
    the temperature scale with "Temperature (°C)" label. The grid is subtle with light
    gray lines. The aspect ratio is properly constrained to maintain geographic proportions.'
