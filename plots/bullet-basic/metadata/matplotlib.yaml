review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent multi-metric bullet chart implementation showing diverse KPIs with different
    scales and units
  - Clean visual hierarchy with grayscale bands providing context without distraction
  - Proper use of matplotlib barh for horizontal bars with correct layering (zorder)
  - Value labels positioned consistently to the right of each metric for easy reading
  - Legend is comprehensive and well-placed, explaining all visual elements
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with meaningful metrics
  weaknesses:
  - No x-axis label (though justified by different units per metric)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays 4 horizontal bullet charts stacked vertically, each representing a different KPI metric. From top to bottom: Revenue (275$K actual vs 250 target), Profit (45% actual vs 50 target), New Customers (85 actual vs 100 target), and Satisfaction (4.2/5 actual vs 4.5 target). Each bullet chart features:
    - A blue (#306998) horizontal bar showing the actual value
    - A black vertical marker line indicating the target
    - Three grayscale background bands (light gray for Poor, medium gray for Satisfactory, darker gray for Good)
    - Value labels displayed to the right of each bar with appropriate units
    The title "bullet-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend in the lower right corner explains the color coding. The layout is clean with subtle dotted vertical grid lines.

        comment: No random seed needed (deterministic data), but data is hardcoded
          so this is acceptable - however marking 0 since there's no explicit seed

        comment: Uses matplotlib's barh, custom legend with Patch and Line2D objects,
          appropriate styling. Could have used more advanced features like FancyBboxPatch
          or custom transforms, but implementation is solid.
  verdict: APPROVED
