review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of Altair geographic capabilities with Mercator projection and topo_feature
  - Good color scheme choice (red-yellow-blue diverging) appropriate for temperature
    data
  - Well-structured layered composition (base map, filled contours, contour markers,
    labels)
  - Realistic temperature pattern with physically plausible features (latitude gradient,
    Gulf Stream effect, Alpine cold spot)
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional data exploration capability
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra text before the required spec-id format
  - Contour lines are represented by scattered points rather than true isolines -
    Altair transform_contour() could create proper contour lines
  - No axis labels showing latitude/longitude coordinates on map edges
  - Point-based contour representation creates a somewhat pixelated appearance rather
    than smooth isolines
  image_description: The plot displays a temperature contour map of Europe using Altair.
    The visualization uses a red-yellow-blue color scheme (reversed) where red/orange
    represents warm temperatures (25-30°C) in the south and blue represents cold temperatures
    (-10 to 5°C) in the north. The data is rendered as small squares creating a heat
    map effect over a Mercator projection of Europe. A gray basemap with country outlines
    is visible underneath the temperature data. Contour labels showing "0°C", "10°C",
    and "20°C" are placed at strategic positions with white stroke for legibility.
    The colorbar on the right shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from -10 to 30. The
    title reads "European Temperature Contours · contour-map-geographic · altair ·
    pyplots.ai". Contour lines are represented by small dark circles marking isotherm
    boundaries rather than actual continuous lines. The geographic coverage extends
    from approximately -25 to 55 longitude and 30 to 72 latitude, covering most of
    Europe including the British Isles, Scandinavia, and the Mediterranean region.
