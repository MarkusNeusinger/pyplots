review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar: layer composition with +, typed
    encodings, and alt.Title with subtitle'
  - Strong data storytelling with trend line, correlation annotation (r=0.92), and
    descriptive subtitle
  - All font sizes explicitly configured for readability at target resolution
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principle with realistic educational
    data scenario
  - Interactive features (.interactive(), tooltips) leverage Altair web-native strengths
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout has wasted space: y-axis domain extends to 105 when max data is 100 and
    x-axis padding is generous; tighter axis domains would improve canvas utilization'
  - The r=0.92 annotation at position (9.2, 38) sits in a visually dead zone; repositioning
    it closer to the trend line or in a subtitle/caption would be more effective
  - Trend line and annotation share the same red (#c44e52) which does not maximize
    the color hierarchy; a softer or contrasting color for the trend line could reduce
    visual competition with the data points
  - Grid opacity and dash styling is good but could be further refined (e.g. removing
    top/right axis domain lines entirely for a cleaner look)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with approximately 100 blue
    filled circular markers (#306998) with white stroke edges on a white background.
    The x-axis is labeled "Study Hours per Day" (range 0-11) and the y-axis "Exam
    Score (%)" (range 20-110). The title reads "scatter-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    in dark text (~28pt) with a gray subtitle "Positive correlation between daily
    study hours and exam performance." A dashed red (#c44e52) trend line runs diagonally
    from lower-left to upper-right showing the positive linear relationship. A bold
    red annotation "r = 0.92" appears in the lower-right area. The grid is subtle
    (dashed, low opacity). Data points cluster along the trend line with natural scatter,
    showing low hours (~1.5-3.5) corresponding to scores ~35-55, mid hours (~4-7)
    to scores ~50-85, and high hours (~8-10) to scores ~77-100 with clipping at 100.
