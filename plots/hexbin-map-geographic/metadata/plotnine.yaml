review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using geom_polygon to implement hexbin functionality that plotnine
    does not natively provide
  - Excellent data scenario with realistic NYC taxi pickup patterns and multiple density
    clusters
  - Good use of grammar of graphics composition with layers (coastline + hexbins)
  - Proper geographic context with coastline overlay and water background color
  - Well-formatted legend with descriptive title Pickup Count
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a function definition (hexbin_geo_polygons) which violates KISS structure
    requirement - should be inline procedural code
  - Title format includes extra prefix Taxi Pickup Density - should be just hexbin-map-geographic
    plotnine pyplots.ai
  - Grid styling is barely visible - spec mentions base map features should show through
    but transparency settings do not achieve this well
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning map showing taxi pickup
    density in a NYC-like metropolitan region. The hexagons are colored using a YlOrRd
    (yellow-orange-red) sequential colormap where darker red indicates higher pickup
    counts (up to ~1200) and lighter yellow indicates lower counts (~400). The background
    features a light blue color representing water/ocean, with a gray polygon outline
    showing a simplified coastline boundary. Three distinct high-density hotspots
    are visible: one downtown area (dark maroon, highest density ~1200+ pickups),
    a midtown cluster (orange, ~800 pickups), and an airport zone (red-orange, ~1000
    pickups). Lower density residential areas appear as pale yellow hexagons scattered
    throughout. The title reads "Taxi Pickup Density · hexbin-map-geographic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axes show Longitude (°) from -74.0 to -73.7 and Latitude
    (°) from 40.5 to 40.9.'
