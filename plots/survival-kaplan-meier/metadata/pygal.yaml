review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Kaplan-Meier step function implementation with proper survival curve visualization
  - Excellent color contrast with colorblind-safe blue and yellow palette
  - Realistic clinical trial context with meaningful treatment group comparison
  - Good use of pygal XY chart type for step function rendering
  - Clean axis labels with units and properly formatted title
  weaknesses:
  - Missing confidence interval bands around survival curves (required by spec)
  - Missing censored observation tick marks on curves (required by spec)
  - Code contains function definitions which violates KISS principle (should be inline)
  - Legend placement could be improved (currently outside plot area)
