review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent two-way faceting implementation with clear row and column structure
  - Realistic temperature vs energy consumption scenario that varies meaningfully
    across regions and seasons
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate use of pandas for data management
  - Good color palette that distinguishes regions while remaining colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of shared axes (sharex=True, sharey=True) for easy comparison across
    facets
  - Effective use of supxlabel/supylabel for shared axis labels
  - White edge on markers improves visibility when points overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Grid and legend score could be improved by adding a small legend explaining region
    colors
  - Row labels positioned with xy=(1.05, 0.5) are functional but tight_layout rect
    may clip them slightly
  - South summer temperatures reaching ~50°C are on the extreme end for realistic
    data
