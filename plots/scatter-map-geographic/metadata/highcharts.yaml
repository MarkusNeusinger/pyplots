review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic positioning of earthquake data along realistic tectonic boundaries
  - Effective use of Highmaps mapbubble series for geographic scatter visualization
  - Clean exponential scaling for magnitude representation
  - Well-organized legend with clear regional color coding
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of alpha transparency on markers for overlapping regions
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw dictionary configuration instead of highcharts-core Python API (but this
    is acceptable for complex map configurations)
  - Legend text size could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map (light gray basemap with country
    boundaries) overlaid with colored bubble markers representing global earthquake
    epicenters. Points are distributed across seismically active regions including
    the Pacific Ring of Fire (Japan in red, North America/Alaska in emerald green,
    South America in blue), Indonesia (amber), Mediterranean/Middle East (purple),
    Central/South Asia (yellow), Pacific/New Zealand (cyan), and Caribbean (pink).
    Point sizes vary according to earthquake magnitude using an exponential scale
    - the largest bubbles represent magnitude 9+ earthquakes (Alaska, Japan, Indonesia,
    Chile) while smaller bubbles represent magnitude 6-7 events. A vertical legend
    on the right side identifies all 8 regions with corresponding colored symbols.
    The title follows the correct format: "Global Earthquake Epicenters · scatter-map-geographic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the size encoding.'
