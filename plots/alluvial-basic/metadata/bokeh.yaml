review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram concept using Bokeh primitives (patch,
    quad, Label)
  - Smooth bezier curves create visually appealing flow bands between time points
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.5) for overlapping flows improves readability
  - Realistic voter migration data scenario with plausible values and meaningful transitions
  - Good color scheme with distinct colors for each party category
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels at 16pt could be larger (20pt+) for better readability at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Helper function bezier_curve breaks the pure KISS structure (imports → data →
    plot → save)
  - No explicit color legend - colors are only identifiable via node labels
  - The M suffix for millions appears without context (no subtitle or note explaining
    units)
