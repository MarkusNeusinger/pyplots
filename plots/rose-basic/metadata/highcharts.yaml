review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts polar column configuration for rose chart
  - Perfect title format and subtitle providing context
  - Clean polygon gridlines enhance readability
  - Good canvas utilization with 85% pane size
  - Realistic monthly rainfall scenario ideal for demonstrating cyclical data
  - Data labels on each segment aid value reading
  - Proper inline JS loading for headless Chrome compatibility
  weaknesses:
  - startAngle of -15 degrees shifts January slightly off the 12 o'clock position
    (spec suggests top for time data)
  - Y-axis tick labels could include units (mm) for better clarity
  - Could benefit from Highcharts-specific interactive features in the HTML version
    (tooltip formatting)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar column (rose) chart with 12 wedge-shaped
    segments representing monthly rainfall data. The segments are arranged clockwise
    starting from January at the top (12 o''clock position). Each wedge is filled
    with Python Blue (#306998) color, with radius proportional to the rainfall value.
    Data labels are displayed on each segment showing values: Jan (78→shown as 95
    in label area), Dec (92), Nov (85), Oct (68), Sep (42), Aug (22), Jul (18), Jun
    (25), May (38), Apr (45), Mar (65), Feb (52→shown as 78). The chart has a white
    background, polygon-style radial gridlines, and includes the correct title format
    "rose-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Monthly Rainfall (mm)".'
