review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of streamline tracing using Euler integration with proper
    handling of bounds and speed thresholds
  - Beautiful color gradient from teal to yellow representing velocity magnitude -
    visually appealing and informative
  - Arrowheads at streamline ends clearly indicate flow direction
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled text elements
  - Clean, well-structured code that is easy to understand
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use "X Position (arbitrary units)" or similar)
  - Could demonstrate more varied flow patterns to showcase streamline capabilities
    beyond simple vortex
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's ColumnDataSource for data organization
  - No interactive features (hover tooltips showing velocity magnitude would enhance
    the Bokeh implementation)
  image_description: The plot displays a vortex flow field visualized as streamlines
    arranged in concentric circular patterns around the origin. The streamlines use
    a gradient color scheme that transitions from teal/gray-green colors in the center
    (representing lower velocity magnitude) to golden-yellow colors at the outer edges
    (representing higher velocity magnitude). Each streamline terminates with an arrowhead
    indicating the flow direction (counterclockwise rotation). The background is a
    light off-white (#fafafa). The title "streamline-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    in the upper-left corner, with "X Position" and "Y Position" axis labels. Axis
    tick marks range from approximately -3 to 3. A subtle dashed grid is visible in
    the background.

          leverage ColumnDataSource more explicitly or add interactivity features
          like hover tools
