review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud visualization with all three components (half-violin, boxplot,
    jittered points) correctly positioned
  - 'Outstanding data quality: includes bimodal distribution (Treatment B) that demonstrates
    the key advantage of raincloud plots over simple boxplots'
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - Correct title format following the specification
  - Clean, reproducible code with proper random seed
  - Interactive features enabled for HTML output
  - Realistic reaction time data that tells a coherent scientific story
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are quite subtle (alpha 0.3) making them barely visible
  - Jittered points could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a raincloud visualization comparing reaction
    times across three conditions: Control (blue), Treatment A (yellow), and Treatment
    B (green). Each condition shows the classic raincloud components: half-violin
    density curves (clouds) extending to the right, boxplots with white median lines
    in the center, and jittered individual data points (rain) scattered to the left.
    The title "raincloud-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis
    shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from 200-600ms. X-axis labels identify each
    condition clearly. A legend in the top-right corner identifies the three conditions
    with colored circles. Treatment B notably shows a bimodal distribution in its
    density curve. The colors are colorblind-friendly (blue, yellow, green).'

        comment: Uses Altair's layering, transform_density, and interactive() features.
          However, the implementation is complex with manual positioning rather than
          leveraging Altair's more declarative strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
