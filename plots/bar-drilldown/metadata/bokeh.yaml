review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hierarchical drilldown with 3 levels of data (Region
    → Country → City)
  - 'Professional use of Bokeh interactive features: CustomJS, TapTool, Button widgets,
    dynamic ColumnDataSource updates'
  - Clean breadcrumb navigation with proper state management
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static preview and interactive use
  - Realistic business data scenario with appropriate scale
  - Good color contrast and colorblind-safe palette
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis category labels are rotated diagonally making them harder to read; horizontal
    labels would be clearer for these short region names
  - Legend not visible in static PNG export despite being defined in code
  - Axis tick labels and category labels appear relatively small compared to the large
    canvas size
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the interactive drilldown functionality which is
    the core feature
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart showing sales data by region with
    three vertical bars: North America (450, blue #306998), Europe (380, yellow #FFD43B),
    and Asia Pacific (320, blue #4B8BBE). The title "bar-drilldown · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    is positioned at the top left. A breadcrumb navigation element "📍 All" appears
    in the top-left corner above the chart. Value labels are displayed above each
    bar. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (millions $)" and the X-axis is labeled "Category".
    An instruction text at the bottom reads "Click on a bar to drill down into subcategories
    | Click breadcrumb links to navigate back". The X-axis category labels are rotated
    diagonally. The chart uses a clean design with subtle horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: Title and value labels are readable but axis labels and x-axis category
          labels appear small relative to the large canvas; x-axis labels are rotated

        comment: 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: CustomJS callbacks for
          interactivity, TapTool for click detection, ColumnDataSource for reactive
          data, Div for HTML breadcrumbs, Button widget, layout composition. Could
          benefit from HoverTool for hover indicator.'
