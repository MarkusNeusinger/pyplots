review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polynomial regression with R² calculation using numpy
  - Clear visualization of diminishing returns economic concept
  - 95% confidence band adds statistical depth
  - Polynomial equation prominently displayed with proper formatting
  - Color scheme (Python blue/gold) is distinctive and accessible
  - All text elements properly sized for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in lower right overlaps slightly with data region; could be placed
    outside or in an empty corner
  - Uses only basic matplotlib/numpy; scipy.stats or sklearn could provide more sophisticated
    polynomial fitting
  - Generic axis units (units) rather than more specific economic terms
