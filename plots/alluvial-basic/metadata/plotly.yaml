review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Sankey diagram with manual node positioning to create
    alluvial-style layout
  - Transparent flow colors (rgba with 0.4 alpha) make overlapping transitions readable
  - Consistent color scheme across all time points makes tracking categories intuitive
  - Year labels as annotations provide clear column headers
  - HTML export enables interactive exploration of the data
  - Well-structured data with realistic voter migration patterns showing both retention
    and movement
  weaknesses:
  - No explicit legend showing the color-to-party mapping (relies on node labels only)
  - Could add hover templates to show exact flow values on interaction
