review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable Chernoff face implementation with clear species differentiation
    through color
  - Good use of the Iris dataset as a realistic, classic multivariate example
  - Well-documented feature mapping explanation at bottom of plot
  - Proper data normalization to 0-1 range before facial feature mapping
  - Faces show meaningful variation especially between species (Setosa sad faces vs
    Virginica happy faces)
  weaknesses:
  - The heatmap code (lines 54-68) exists but does NOT appear in the rendered image
    - this is a critical issue where code does not match output
  - No actual seaborn plotting function visible in final output - only uses seaborn
    for styling, data loading, and color palette which violates AR-05 spirit
  - Face size (figsize 12x12) results in image dimensions that may not match the recommended
    4800x2700 or 3600x3600 at 300 dpi
  - Within-species variation is subtle and hard to distinguish (all Setosa faces look
    nearly identical)
