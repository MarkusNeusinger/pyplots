review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color coding distinguishing increases (blue) from decreases (yellow)
    with colorblind-safe palette
  - Clear entity labels at both endpoints with values in parentheses for easy reading
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid) and lineplot function
  - Well-proportioned layout with appropriate margins for labels
  - Realistic tech company revenue scenario that demonstrates the visualization purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap around the 125-175 revenue range where multiple entities cluster
  - Seaborn lineplot used in a loop rather than leveraging native grouping capabilities
  - Could benefit from more dramatic rank changes in the data to better showcase slope
    chart strength
  image_description: The plot displays a slope chart comparing Q1 vs Q4 revenue for
    8 tech companies. Lines connect data points between two vertical axes labeled
    "Q1 Revenue ($M)" and "Q4 Revenue ($M)". Blue (#306998) lines indicate revenue
    increases (TechCorp, DataFlow, NetWorks, CodeBase, LogicPro - 5 companies), while
    yellow (#FFD43B) lines show decreases (CloudNine, ByteSize, SoftEdge - 3 companies).
    Each endpoint is labeled with the company name and value in parentheses. The title
    "slope-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in the lower
    right distinguishes "Increase" and "Decrease" categories. The layout has appropriate
    margins with labels positioned clearly outside the plot area.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot and sns.set_style but slope charts aren't a seaborn
          specialty; matplotlib does heavy lifting for annotations
