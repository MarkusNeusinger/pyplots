review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts packedbubble chart type with splitSeries to achieve
    circle packing effect
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme with distinct blues, yellows, and purples
  - Well-structured realistic data representing software project components
  - Parent bubbles with semi-transparent fill and stroke create clear visual hierarchy
  - Data labels with value-based filtering prevent clutter on small bubbles
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Only 13 nodes across 2 hierarchy levels, spec suggests 20-200 nodes across 2-4
    levels
  - API Routes label appears outside its bubble, slightly affecting visual clarity
  - Legend colors appear lighter than actual bubble colors due to parent node styling
  - Layout simulation may produce slightly different arrangements between renders
