review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style calendar heatmap implementation with proper week/day structure
  - Custom colormap using LinearSegmentedColormap closely matches GitHub contribution
    colors
  - Realistic data generation with weekday bias and occasional high-activity days
  - Clean removal of axis spines for a modern, minimalist look
  - Month labels positioned at top exactly as specified
  - Proper inversion of y-axis so Monday appears at top (standard convention)
  - White cell borders provide clear visual separation between days
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar could be larger (shrink=0.4 makes it relatively small) for better readability
  - The code iterates through DataFrame rows inefficiently - could use vectorized
    operations
  - Missing some edge cases in data patterns (e.g., extended no-activity periods,
    project deadline spikes)
  image_description: The plot displays a GitHub-style calendar heatmap showing daily
    activity (commits) for the year 2024. The layout consists of a grid with 7 rows
    (Mon-Sun weekdays labeled on the y-axis) and 53 columns (weeks of the year). Month
    labels (Jan-Dec) appear at the top. Each cell represents a day, colored using
    a green sequential colormap from light gray (#ebedf0) for zero activity to dark
    green (#196127) for high activity. The cells are separated by white borders. A
    horizontal colorbar at the bottom shows the scale from 0.0 to ~18+ commits, labeled
    "Daily Activity (commits)". The title "heatmap-calendar · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in a large, readable font. The visualization clearly shows
    weekday vs weekend patterns, with weekdays generally showing more activity (more
    green) than weekends.

        comment: Uses pcolormesh effectively, LinearSegmentedColormap for custom colors,
          proper axes manipulation. Could have used imshow with extent or other matplotlib-specific
          features for cleaner code
  verdict: APPROVED
