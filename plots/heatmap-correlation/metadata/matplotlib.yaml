review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging colormap (RdBu_r) properly centered at zero with fixed -1
    to 1 range
  - Smart text color contrast (white on dark backgrounds, black on light)
  - Lower triangle masking reduces redundancy as recommended in spec
  - Realistic economic indicator correlations that tell a coherent story
  - Clean square layout perfect for correlation matrices
  - Proper annotation with 2 decimal places as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Could include more extreme negative correlations (e.g., -0.85 to -0.95 range)
    to fully demonstrate the colormap range
  - Missing explicit axis labels (though variable names serve this purpose for correlation
    matrices)
