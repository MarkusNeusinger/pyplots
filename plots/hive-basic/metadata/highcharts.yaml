review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts SVGRenderer API for custom hive plot visualization
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple) with good contrast
  - Clear axis labels and well-positioned legend
  - Curved edges with transparency effectively show connection patterns without clutter
  - Realistic software dependency network scenario with meaningful module names
  - Clean, well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Plot uses only ~40% of canvas area; could be scaled larger to fill more space
  - Node labels are readable but could be slightly larger for better legibility at
    full resolution
  - Missing interactive features like tooltips on hover that would showcase Highcharts
    capabilities
  - Edge thickness/weight visualization not implemented despite spec mentioning optional
    weight attribute
