review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual fidelity with classic wooden board colors
  - Perfect adherence to chess board standards (white at bottom, light square at h1)
  - Scholar's Mate is a meaningful, educational position
  - Clean Unicode chess symbols that are clearly recognizable
  - Proper coordinate labeling matching chess conventions
  weaknesses:
  - CQ-02 scored 1/3 because while deterministic, no explicit seed statement exists
    (minor since no randomness is used)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8×8 chess board with the classic wooden
    board color scheme (light tan #F0D9B5 and brown #B58863 squares). The board shows
    the Scholar''s Mate position with chess pieces rendered as Unicode symbols. White
    pieces (outlined style) occupy the bottom ranks with King on d1, Rook on a1 and
    h1, Knight on b1, Bishop on c1 and c4, pawns on a2-d2, f2-h2, and e4, plus the
    Queen delivering checkmate on f7. Black pieces (filled style) are on the top ranks
    with King on e8, Queen on d8, Rooks on a8 and h8, Knight on b8, c6, and f6, Bishop
    on c8, and pawns on a7-d7, e5, g7-h7. File labels (a-h) appear below the board
    and rank labels (1-8) on the left side, both in blue (#306998). The board has
    a blue border matching the coordinate labels. The title "Scholar''s Mate · chessboard-pieces
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue bold text. White is correctly
    at the bottom (rows 1-2) and the light square is correctly at h1.'
