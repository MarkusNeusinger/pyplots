review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using centered horizontal bars to simulate funnel appearance
  - Excellent color progression from Python blue to gold yellow
  - Clear value and percentage labels with appropriate text color contrast (white
    on dark, dark on light)
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed axes and spines
  - Uses exact data from specification example
  weaknesses:
  - Not a true trapezoidal funnel shape - uses rectangular bars instead of narrowing
    trapezoids
  - No random seed set (minor, since data is deterministic)
  - Could benefit from conversion rate indicators between stages
