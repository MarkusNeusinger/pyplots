review:
  strengths:
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (Q, N, O)
  - Good use of layered composition (pie + text_labels + pct_labels)
  - Interactive selection highlighting on hover/click
  - Comprehensive tooltips with formatted budget values
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic business data scenario with appropriate hierarchical structure
  weaknesses:
  - The breadcrumb navigation is purely visual/static in the PNG - actual drilldown
    navigation only works in HTML version
  - Two blue color shades (Engineering and Operations) are too similar and could cause
    confusion
  - The breadcrumb text spacing is uneven and looks fragmented
  - Missing animated transitions for drill navigation as specified
  - The hierarchical sub-level data is defined but never rendered - implementation
    only shows top level
