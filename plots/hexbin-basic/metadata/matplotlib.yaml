review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of three distinct density clusters that tell a clear urban sensor
    story
  - Inferno colormap on warm background creates strong visual impact with professional
    polish
  - LogNorm scaling reveals the full density range without losing detail in sparse
    areas
  - Clean annotations with styled boxes guide the viewer without cluttering
  - All spec requirements fully implemented including colorbar, perceptually uniform
    colormap, gridsize, and log scale
  weaknesses:
  - Subtitle (14pt) and annotation text (12-13pt) could be slightly larger for optimal
    legibility at full resolution
  - Axis labels use Longitude/Latitude (km) which is a minor terminology inconsistency
    (degrees vs km)
  improvements: []
  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization titled "hexbin-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Urban sensor density across three city
    zones — 10,000 readings." Hexagons are colored using the inferno colormap, ranging
    from black (low density, ~1 count) through purple and orange to bright yellow
    (high density, ~100+ counts). Three distinct density clusters are visible: "Downtown
    (high density)" centered around coordinates (2, 2) showing the brightest yellow
    hexagons, "Industrial District" centered around (-2, -1) with moderate-to-high
    density, and "Suburbs" centered around (1, -2) as a smaller concentration. Each
    cluster is labeled with a text annotation in a dark rounded box with light text.
    The x-axis is labeled "Longitude (km)" ranging from -6 to 8, the y-axis "Latitude
    (km)" ranging from about -4 to 7. A vertical colorbar on the right shows "Sensor
    Reading Count" on a logarithmic scale (10^0 to ~10^2). The background is a warm
    light gray (#f5f5f0), top and right spines are removed, and white hexagon edges
    provide clean visual separation.'
