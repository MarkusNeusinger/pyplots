review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the complex Skew-T Log-P thermodynamic diagram
  - Proper logarithmic and inverted pressure axis with clear tick formatting
  - All required reference lines (isotherms, dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing
    ratio) present with appropriate colors and line styles
  - Clean, readable code structure with good organization
  - Custom legend using Line2D handles is well-implemented
  - Temperature and dewpoint profiles clearly distinguishable
  weaknesses:
  - Reference lines slightly clutter the background; could use more subtle alpha values
  - The VQ-07 grid styling could be improved - multiple reference line types create
    visual complexity
  - Wind barbs could enhance the diagram (though optional per spec)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a
    logarithmic pressure axis (inverted, 1000 hPa at bottom to 100 hPa at top) and
    temperature on the x-axis ranging from -80°C to about 50°C. Two main data profiles
    are shown: a solid red temperature line with circular markers and a dashed blue
    dewpoint line with circular markers. Background reference lines include: dark
    red isotherms (skewed ~45°), green dashed dry adiabats, blue-gray dash-dot moist
    adiabats, and purple dotted mixing ratio lines. Pressure level annotations (1000,
    850, 700, 500, 300, 200 hPa) appear in gray on the left side. A legend in the
    upper right identifies all line types. The title "skewt-logp-atmospheric · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold.'

        comment: Good use of log scale, ScalarFormatter, Line2D for custom legend,
          but could use SkewT transform from metpy or custom transforms for more authentic
          skew behavior
