review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required ROC curve features (diagonal reference,
    AUC in legend, multiple model comparison)
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate font sizing for the large canvas
  - Well-structured KISS code with proper reproducibility (seed 42)
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for branding consistency
  - Dashed reference line provides clear visual distinction from model curves
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner outside plot creates slight visual imbalance
  - ROC curves for two models only; adding a third classifier would demonstrate more
    variation
  - Model A AUC of 0.98 is unrealistically high for most real-world scenarios
