review:
  strengths:
  - Clean forest plot structure with all required meta-analysis elements (studies,
    CIs, pooled diamond, null reference line)
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme using blue for studies and yellow/gold for pooled
    estimate
  - Marker size correctly varies by study weight, showing visual encoding of study
    importance
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic meta-analysis data with appropriate variation in effect sizes and CI
    widths
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title "Mean Difference (95% CI)" is not visible in the rendered plot image
    (appears cut off or not rendered)
  - Excessive whitespace at the bottom of the plot below the pooled estimate
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like enhanced tooltips showing
    exact values, weight percentages, or interactive hover states
