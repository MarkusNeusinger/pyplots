review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy.signal.spectrogram for proper FFT-based spectrogram computation
  - Viridis colormap is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended in
    spec
  - dB scale conversion (10 * log10) provides better dynamic range visualization
  - Clean chirp signal generation with appropriate parameters demonstrates frequency
    sweep clearly
  - Proper axis labels with units (seconds, Hz, dB) as specified
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good text sizing for legibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Interactive HTML output also generated
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to help read values at specific time-frequency points
  - Y-axis shows 0-500 Hz but chirp only goes to 200 Hz, wasting some visual space
  - Could benefit from minor grid for easier value reading on the heatmap
  image_description: The spectrogram displays a time-frequency heatmap showing a chirp
    signal with frequency increasing over time. The plot uses the viridis colormap
    with colors ranging from dark purple (low power, ~-80 dB) through teal/green (mid
    power, ~-40 to -60 dB) to bright yellow (high power, ~-20 dB). The X-axis shows
    "Time (seconds)" from 0 to 2, and the Y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" from 0 to
    500. A clear diagonal bright yellow band sweeps from low frequency (~10 Hz) at
    time 0 to approximately 200 Hz at time 2 seconds, demonstrating the characteristic
    chirp pattern. The title reads "spectrogram-basic · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" at
    the top. A colorbar legend on the right shows "Power (dB)" with the scale. The
    background noise appears as scattered teal/green tiles outside the main signal
    band.
