review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for all elements
  - Proper sorting of bars (largest at top) for easy visual comparison
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed top/right spines
  - Value labels positioned perfectly at bar ends with proper formatting
  - Realistic data scenario that is immediately understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Could highlight the top 1-3 languages with a different color to draw attention
    as suggested in spec
  - Bar edge color adds visual complexity without clear benefit
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing "Top 10 programming
    languages by popularity". The chart uses a blue color (#306998) for all bars with
    a darker edge. Python is at the top with 68.2%, followed by JavaScript at 62.5%,
    then Java, C++, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, and Swift at the bottom with 18.3%.
    Bars are sorted from largest (top) to smallest (bottom). Each bar has a percentage
    label at its end. The x-axis shows "Popularity (%)" ranging from 0 to 80, and
    the y-axis shows "Programming Language". The title correctly uses the format "bar-horizontal
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed grid appears on the x-axis. Top and
    right spines are removed for a cleaner look.
