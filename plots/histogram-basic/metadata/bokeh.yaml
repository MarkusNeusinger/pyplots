review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with median/mean annotations, group labels, and descriptive
    subtitle
  - Sophisticated intensity-mapped color gradient gives visual emphasis to the peak
  - Typography hierarchy is carefully crafted with explicit font sizes at all levels
  - Clean, polished visual refinement (subtle grid, removed spines, custom margins)
  - Realistic marathon finish time scenario with well-constructed bimodal distribution
  - HoverTool adds interactivity in the HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Manual RGB color interpolation loop is over-engineered; Bokeh's linear_cmap mapper
    or a palette-based approach would be more idiomatic and concise
  - Right side of the canvas has some wasted space where the annotation labels don't
    fully balance the layout
  - The 'Slower group' annotation label position at y=max_count*0.60 could overlap
    with bars in certain data configurations
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of marathon finish times for ~500
    runners. The x-axis is labeled "Finish Time (min)" ranging from ~120 to ~400,
    and the y-axis is labeled "Number of Runners" ranging from 0 to ~60. The title
    "histogram-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in bold dark text in the upper
    left. A gray subtitle reads "N = 500 runners | Right-skewed bimodal distribution."
    Bars use an intensity-mapped blue color gradient — taller (higher-count) bars
    are darker (#306998), shorter bars are lighter (#4A8BBE) — with white edge lines
    separating each bin. A solid red vertical line marks the median at ~251 min, with
    a red label in the upper right area. A dashed teal/green vertical line marks the
    mean at ~259 min, with a matching green label below the median label. Two blue
    text annotations with down-arrow symbols identify the "Main group (~4 hr pace)"
    above the main peak and "Slower group (~5 hr pace)" over the right shoulder. The
    background is white with subtle horizontal y-axis gridlines only. No top or right
    spines are shown. The distribution is clearly right-skewed and bimodal with a
    long tail of outliers extending past 350 min.
