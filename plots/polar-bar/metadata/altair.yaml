review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of mark_arc for creating polar bar chart wedges with proper theta/theta2
    angle calculations
  - Clean direction label positioning using calculated x/y coordinates from polar
    coordinates
  - Effective color encoding with sequential blues scheme that enhances data interpretation
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional data exploration capability
  - Realistic wind frequency data with prevailing westerlies pattern demonstrates
    domain knowledge
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title shows Frequency (days) but the scale numbers do not include units
    in tick labels
  - Scale factor 4.5 produces approximately 4050x4050 pixels which does not match
    the standard 3600x3600 or 4800x2700 target sizes
  - Could demonstrate stacked bars for wind speed ranges as mentioned in spec notes
