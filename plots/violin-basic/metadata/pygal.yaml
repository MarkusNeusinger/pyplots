review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution implementing violin plots in pygal which lacks native
    violin chart support
  - Clean manual KDE implementation with proper bandwidth calculation using Silvermans
    rule
  - 'Properly includes all spec requirements: mirrored density, quartile boxes, and
    median lines'
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette
  - Good separation and layout of four categories
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is redundant since x-axis already shows category labels
  - Quartile boxes inside violins are quite small and subtle, could be more prominent
  - Performance scores exceeding 100 seems unusual for a score context (typically
    0-100)
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes representing performance
    score distributions for Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Operations departments.
    Each violin is rendered in a distinct color: blue (Engineering), coral/orange
    (Marketing), dark gray (Sales), and olive/gold (Operations). The violins show
    mirrored kernel density estimates with small rectangular quartile boxes inside
    and horizontal median lines. The title "violin-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. X-axis shows "Category" with department labels, Y-axis shows "Performance
    Score" ranging from 20 to 130. A legend at the bottom repeats the category names
    with color indicators.'
