review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn heatmap function with mask parameter for triangle display
  - Well-chosen real estate context with realistic correlated variables showing diverse
    correlation strengths
  - 'Perfect implementation of spec requirements: diverging colormap, centered at
    0, fixed -1 to 1 range, 2-decimal annotations'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good font sizing and layout for the high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Colorbar label is set twice (via cbar_kws and separately on cbar.ax),
    which is redundant but not harmful'
