review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of Sankey diagram using bezier curves for smooth
    flow bands
  - Good use of seaborn color palettes (HUSL for sources, Set2 for targets) creating
    visual distinction
  - Clear node labels with energy values in TWh units provide context
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper handling of flow stacking at nodes prevents overlapping bands
  weaknesses:
  - Dual legends are redundant since node labels already display names - consider
    removing legends or integrating flow percentages
  - Limited seaborn-specific features used (only styling/palettes) since seaborn lacks
    native Sankey support
  - Source totals are too uniform (Coal=Gas=60 TWh) - more variety in magnitudes would
    better demonstrate proportional scaling
