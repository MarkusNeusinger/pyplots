review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and properly sorted bars within
    each cluster
  - Correct implementation of silhouette plot with all required features from the
    spec
  - Good use of colorblind-safe color palette with strong visual contrast
  - Proper use of Iris dataset as a realistic, educational example
  - Clean, reproducible code following KISS principles
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be better positioned to avoid proximity to the average
    line annotation
  - Missing negative silhouette values in the visualization which would better demonstrate
    the full range of the metric
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover data
    showing sample indices
  image_description: 'The plot displays a silhouette plot with three horizontal bar
    clusters representing K-means clustering results on the Iris dataset. The clusters
    are colored in Python blue (#306998) for Cluster 0 at the bottom, bright yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Cluster 1 in the middle, and coral red (#E84A5F) for Cluster 2 at
    the top. Each cluster shows sorted horizontal bars representing individual sample
    silhouette coefficients. A red dashed vertical line indicates the average silhouette
    score (0.553) with a label at the top. The x-axis shows "Silhouette Coefficient"
    ranging from -0.2 to 1.0, and the y-axis shows "Samples (grouped by cluster)"
    with cluster labels on the left side. The legend in the upper right shows each
    cluster with its average score (Cluster 0: 0.42, Cluster 1: 0.80, Cluster 2: 0.45).
    The title follows the correct format: "silhouette-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Uses go.Bar and basic Plotly features, but misses opportunity for
          interactive hover enhancements beyond basic template, could use subplot
          annotations more effectively
  verdict: APPROVED
