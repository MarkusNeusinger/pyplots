review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for clean data binding and annotations
  - Proper categorical x-axis configuration with x_range parameter
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (customer satisfaction survey) that demonstrates
    the count plot purpose
  - Data is automatically counted and sorted by frequency as recommended in spec
  - Both static (PNG) and interactive (HTML) outputs generated
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be slightly more subtle (alpha 0.3 is at the upper end of recommended
    0.2-0.4 range)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing customer satisfaction
    survey responses. Five blue bars (#306998) are arranged in descending order by
    count: Satisfied (66), Very Satisfied (56), Neutral (36), Dissatisfied (27), and
    Very Dissatisfied (15). Each bar has a count label positioned above it in matching
    blue text. The title "count-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The x-axis is labeled "Response Category" with slightly rotated category names,
    and the y-axis is labeled "Number of Responses" with values from 0 to ~70. The
    background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines. The
    bars have a darker blue border and slight transparency (alpha=0.85).'
