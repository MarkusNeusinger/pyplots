review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly graph_objects for custom shape drawing with go.Scatter
    fill=toself
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors (blue, yellow, green) at appropriate
    transparency
  - All 7 Venn regions labeled with counts and descriptive text for exclusive regions
  - Proper mathematical calculation of exclusive region sizes
  - Outputs both static PNG and interactive HTML leveraging Plotly interactivity capability
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining the data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Square format (1200x1200 scaled to 3600x3600) deviates from recommended 1600x900
    landscape in library rules (minor, justified for this plot type)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3-circle Venn diagram on a white background.
    The three circles represent Python (blue, top), JavaScript (yellow, bottom-left),
    and SQL (green, bottom-right). Each circle is filled with semi-transparent color
    (approx. 50% opacity) allowing overlap regions to be visible. Set labels appear
    outside each circle with total counts in parentheses: Python (100), JavaScript
    (80), SQL (60). Each region displays its count: Python only (60), JavaScript only
    (35), SQL only (25), Python & JavaScript (20), Python & SQL (10), JavaScript &
    SQL (15), and All three (10) in the center. The title "venn-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The diagram uses an equilateral triangle arrangement with
    good spacing.'
