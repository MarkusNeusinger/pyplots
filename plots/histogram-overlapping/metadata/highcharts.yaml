review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of overlapping effect using grouping: false in plot
    options'
  - Colorblind-safe palette (yellow, purple, blue) with good transparency (0.55 alpha)
  - Clear, realistic data scenario with meaningful sample sizes in legend
  - Proper bin alignment across all three distributions
  - Good subtitle adding context to the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box is slightly isolated in upper right corner; could be positioned closer
    to the chart area
  - Y-axis label Frequency (Count) is slightly redundant
  - Image height is 2561px instead of target 2700px
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays three overlapping histograms showing employee performance score distributions across three departments. The chart uses semi-transparent column bars with:
    - **Yellow** (Sales, n=150) - widest distribution, lower center
    - **Purple** (Marketing, n=150) - middle layer
    - **Blue** (Engineering, n=150) - highest concentration around 71-78 range

    The title reads "histogram-overlapping · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Employee Performance Score Distribution by Department". X-axis shows "Performance Score" (ranging from 16 to 125), Y-axis shows "Frequency (Count)" (0-56). A boxed legend in the upper right identifies each department with sample sizes. Bars overlap correctly with transparency (~0.55 alpha), allowing visibility of all three distributions. The overlapping regions show blended colors where distributions intersect.

        comment: Uses grouping:false for overlap effect, shared tooltips, proper Highcharts
          column series configuration. Could leverage more interactive features like
          hover states or data labels.
  verdict: APPROVED
