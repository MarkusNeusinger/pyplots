review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario demonstrating energy consumption vs temperature
    with realistic U-shaped relationship
  - R² value and polynomial equation prominently displayed with proper formatting
  - Clean use of plotnine geom_smooth with formula parameter for polynomial regression
  - Confidence band adds valuable statistical context
  - Color scheme provides excellent contrast and accessibility
  - Text sizing follows recommended guidelines perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Annotation text size (14pt) is slightly small compared to axis labels; could be
    more prominent at 16-18pt for better visibility
  - The confidence band uses the same color as the regression line which reduces visual
    distinction
