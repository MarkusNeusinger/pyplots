review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent code structure following KISS principles with clean data generation
    using NumPy meshgrid
  - Good use of viridis colormap which is colorblind-accessible
  - Creative solution using mark_rect() with explicit x2/y2 bounds to create a gridded
    visualization
  - Appropriate canvas sizing (1400x800 with 3x scale factor) achieving target resolution
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Not a true filled contour plot - displays as a continuous heatmap rather than
    discrete color bands between contour levels as specified
  - Missing overlaid contour lines which the spec suggests for precise level identification
  - Colorbar label Intensity is generic - could be more descriptive of the mathematical
    function being visualized
