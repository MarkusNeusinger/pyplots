  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme using consistent color families per department
    (blues for Engineering, yellows for Marketing, greens for Sales, purples for Operations)
  - 'Smart labeling strategy: labels only larger segments (>0.25 radians) to avoid
    clutter'
  - Center text showing total budget provides valuable context
  - Good use of Bokeh annular_wedge for creating proper donut rings with gap between
    inner/outer
  - White line separators create clear visual distinction between segments
  - Appropriate square format (3600x3600) for circular chart type
  weaknesses:
  - Figure dimensions differ from library guide recommendation (4800x2700), though
    square is appropriate for donut
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance interactivity in the HTML output
  - Inner ring label font size could be slightly larger given the segment sizes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a nested donut chart showing budget allocation
    data. The **inner ring** shows 4 department totals: Engineering ($800K, dark blue),
    Marketing ($430K, golden yellow), Sales ($450K, green), and Operations ($330K,
    purple/mauve). The **outer ring** shows expense categories within each department
    using lighter shades of the parent color - Engineering has Salaries, Equipment,
    Training, Cloud; Marketing has Advertising, Events, Content; Sales has Salaries,
    Travel, Tools; Operations has Facilities, IT Support, Utilities. The center displays
    "Total $2010K" in blue text. Title "donut-nested · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. White line separators divide segments. Labels show category names
    and values in $K format. The chart uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with good canvas
    utilization.'
