review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent contour visualization with 8 clearly visible density levels
  - Smart approach using matplotlib for KDE contour extraction then rendering in Bokeh
  - Good color gradient from light blue (low density) to dark blue (high density)
  - Scatter point overlay provides valuable context for the underlying data
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Two-cluster data effectively demonstrates density variation
  weaknesses:
  - The legend text "Data points" is minimal and could be more descriptive
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib for contour extraction rather than using a more Bokeh-native
    solution
  image_description: The plot displays a density contour plot with two distinct bivariate
    clusters. The contours are rendered in a blue gradient from light blue (outer,
    lower density) to dark blue/black (inner, higher density). There are 8 contour
    levels visible, clearly showing two separate density peaks - one centered around
    (25, 35) and another around (40, 50). Yellow/gold scatter points are overlaid
    showing the actual data distribution with appropriate transparency. The title
    "contour-density · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top left. X-axis is labeled
    "Measurement A (units)" and Y-axis is labeled "Measurement B (units)". A legend
    for "Data points" appears in the top left. The plot has a clean white background
    with subtle dashed grid lines.

        comment: Grid is appropriately subtle (alpha 0.3, dashed), but legend is very
          sparse (just "Data points") and positioned in a way that overlaps slightly
          with the title

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and export_png correctly, but relies on matplotlib
          for the heavy lifting (contour extraction). The Bokeh-native approach would
          be more distinctive.
  verdict: APPROVED
