review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clear cluster separation visible - Setosa distinctly separated from Versicolor/Virginica
  - Proper use of transparency (0.5 opacity) to show overlapping curve density
  - Well-implemented Andrews curve transformation following Fourier series formula
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  - Normalized data using StandardScaler as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function andrews_curve() deviates from pure KISS structure (minor)
  - Y-axis label f(t) could be more descriptive for general audience
