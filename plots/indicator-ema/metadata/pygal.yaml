review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with distinct line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for
    each series
  - Proper use of pygal Style class for customizing fonts and colors to work at the
    large canvas size
  - Price line is appropriately thicker than EMA lines as per spec
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of major x-axis labels to reduce clutter while maintaining date readability
  weaknesses:
  - The grid only shows horizontal lines (y-guides); adding subtle vertical guidelines
    could improve date reference
  - Crossover points between EMAs are not highlighted as suggested in the spec Notes
    section
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing stock price data with
    two EMA overlays over 120 trading days (January to May 2024). The close price
    is shown as a solid blue line with visible volatility and a general downtrend
    from ~$150 to ~$130. The 12-day EMA is displayed as a yellow/gold dashed line
    that closely follows the price movements. The 26-day EMA appears as a red dotted
    line that is smoother and slower to react. The title "indicator-ema · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from
    approximately 126 to 162, and the X-axis shows "Date" with rotated date labels
    at 45 degrees. A legend at the bottom shows "Close Price", "EMA 12-day", and "EMA
    26-day" with their respective colors and line styles. The plot has subtle horizontal
    grid lines and a clean white background.
