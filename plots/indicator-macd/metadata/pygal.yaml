review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of MACD chart using pygal capabilities creatively
  - Proper use of filled areas to represent histogram (green for positive, red for
    negative)
  - 'Clear color coding: blue MACD, orange Signal, green/red histogram, gray dashed
    zero line'
  - Good font sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  - Clean code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram representation using filled area rather than discrete bars (library
    limitation workaround)
  - Layout could utilize more vertical canvas space
  image_description: The plot displays a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    technical indicator chart rendered in pygal. The chart features a title "indicator-macd
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top in dark gray text. The MACD Line (blue) is a
    continuous line showing the MACD values (12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA), oscillating
    between approximately -3.5 and +1.5. The Signal Line (orange) is a smoother line
    showing the 9-day EMA of MACD, tracking the MACD line. The Histogram (+) (green
    filled area) displays positive histogram values as filled areas above the zero
    line, while the Histogram (−) (red filled area) shows negative histogram values
    as filled areas below the zero line. A dashed gray horizontal Zero Reference Line
    sits at y=0. The X-axis is labeled "Date" with dates from Feb 20 through May 20,
    showing every 20th date at 45-degree rotation. The Y-axis is labeled "MACD Value"
    ranging from approximately -3.5 to +1.5. The legend is positioned at the bottom
    showing all 5 series (MACD, Signal, Histogram +/-, Zero). The layout uses a white
    background with subtle gray grid lines on the Y-axis.
