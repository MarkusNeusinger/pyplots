review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wireframe using Scatter3d traces for both x and y
    grid lines
  - Clean, elegant visual design with consistent Python Blue color scheme
  - Perfect title format and professional axis labeling with mathematical notation
    for Z axis
  - Appropriate viewing angle that showcases the 3D structure effectively
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Code follows KISS principle with clear structure
  weaknesses:
  - X and Y axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis) rather than descriptive with
    units
  - Could utilize Plotly hover capabilities to show (x, y, z) coordinates on wireframe
    lines
  - Single uniform color misses opportunity for height-based coloring mentioned as
    optional in spec
