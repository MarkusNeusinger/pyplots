review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of the spec using small multiples for a library without
    native animation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of yellow highlight markers to indicate the current data point in each
    stage
  - Realistic and engaging website traffic scenario with trend and seasonality
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/Legend score reduced due to no legend present (minor for single-series)
  - Could add a gradient or arrow to better indicate direction of progression
  - Does not leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features which would enhance the
    visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples layout showing website
    traffic progression over time. Each panel represents a different time snapshot:
    "1. Q2 2023" (top-left), "2. Q4 2023" (top-right), "3. Q2 2024" (bottom-left),
    and "4. Q4 2024" (bottom-right). The line is rendered in a bold blue color (#306998)
    with small blue circular markers at each data point. Each panel highlights the
    most recent data point with a larger yellow/gold marker (#FFD43B). The x-axis
    shows time periods (Jun ''23 through Dec ''24) and the y-axis shows Monthly Visitors
    ranging from 30,000 to 100,000. The title "line-animated-progressive · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large bold text. The background is light gray
    (#FAFAFA) with subtle grid lines. The progressive reveal concept is well executed
    - each subsequent panel shows more of the time series being "drawn."'
