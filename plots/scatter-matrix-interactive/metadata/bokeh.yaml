review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of shared ColumnDataSource enabling linked brushing across all scatter
    plots
  - Clean selection/nonselection styling with appropriate alpha values (0.9 selected,
    0.15 nonselected)
  - Proper colorblind-friendly color palette
  - Good use of the Iris dataset showing clear species clustering
  - Correct title format and well-structured 4x4 grid layout
  - Interactive tools (box_select, pan, zoom, reset) properly configured
  weaknesses:
  - Diagonal histograms are static and do not update based on selection (spec requires
    this)
  - No hover tooltips showing point details (would improve interactivity)
  - Legend placement in a scatter plot cell is functional but not ideal
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) visualizing
    the Iris dataset with 4 variables: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and
    Petal Width. The diagonal cells contain blue histograms showing the univariate
    distribution of each variable. Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots of variable
    pairs, with points colored by species: blue (#306998) for Setosa, yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Versicolor, and green (#4CAF50) for Virginica. A legend in the top-right subplot
    identifies the three species. The title "scatter-matrix-interactive · bokeh ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left. Axis labels include units "(cm)" and are
    positioned on the edges (left column for Y-axis, bottom row for X-axis). The grid
    is subtle with alpha=0.3. The Bokeh toolbar is visible on the right side with
    box_select, pan, wheel_zoom, and reset tools.'
