review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of combining violin and box plots with clear visual hierarchy
  - 'Outstanding data variety: four groups showcasing symmetric, bimodal, skewed,
    and outlier-heavy distributions'
  - Python-themed color scheme (blue violins, yellow boxes) is visually appealing
    and colorblind-safe
  - Perfect text sizing following matplotlib guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Clean code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a simple legend to explain what the colors represent (violin = density,
    box = summary statistics)
  - Could use matplotlib's more advanced violin customization options like showing
    quantiles directly in the violin
  image_description: 'The plot shows a violin plot with embedded box plots for 4 experimental
    groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C). The violins are rendered
    in Python blue (#306998) with 70% opacity, showing KDE density shapes. Inside
    each violin is a narrow yellow (#FFD43B) box plot showing median (red line), quartiles
    (box), and whiskers. The plot has a subtle dashed y-axis grid with alpha 0.3.
    The title reads "violin-box · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in large font at the top.
    X-axis is labeled "Experimental Group" and Y-axis "Response Value (units)". All
    four groups show distinctly different distributions: Control is symmetric/normal,
    Treatment A shows bimodal distribution, Treatment B shows right-skewed distribution
    with upper outliers, and Treatment C shows wide spread with both upper and lower
    outliers visible as blue dots.'

        comment: Uses violinplot and boxplot correctly but overlaying them manually
          is a workaround rather than using a more distinctive feature
