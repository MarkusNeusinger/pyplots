review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PCA biplot with clear separation of species clusters
  - Smart label positioning with manual offsets to avoid overlap between Petal Length/Width
    labels
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot for the observation scores with proper hue/palette
    handling
  - Axis labels include variance explained percentages as specified
  - Clean, readable code with manual PCA implementation using numpy
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot content (lower right is slightly
    isolated)
  - Seaborn is primarily used for scatter plot while loading arrows rely on matplotlib
    annotations - could potentially use additional seaborn features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot using the Iris dataset. Observation
    scores are shown as scatter points colored by species: blue (#306998) for setosa
    (positioned on the right side of PC1), yellow (#FFD43B) for versicolor (center-left),
    and olive green (#6B8E23) for virginica (left side). Four loading arrows originate
    from the origin, representing the original variables: Sepal Width points upward
    (positive PC2), Sepal Length points upper-left, and Petal Length/Petal Width point
    left along the negative PC1 axis. Each arrow is labeled with bold text in white
    boxes. Axis labels show variance explained: PC1 (73.0%) and PC2 (22.9%). The title
    follows the required format "biplot-pca · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend is positioned
    in the lower right corner showing the three species. Dashed gray reference lines
    cross at the origin, and a subtle grid is visible throughout the plot area. The
    plot uses an equal aspect ratio with symmetric axis limits.'
