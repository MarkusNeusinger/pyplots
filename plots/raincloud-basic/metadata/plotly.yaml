quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution in Treatment B - clearly visible
    in the half-violin shape
  - Smart use of Plotly go.Violin with side=positive/negative to create the raincloud
    effect
  - Rich hover information showing detailed statistics (median, Q1-Q3, mean ± std)
  - Clean color palette that is colorblind-friendly
  - Proper use of transparency (opacity=0.6) for both cloud and rain points
  - All three raincloud components (cloud, box, rain) are clearly distinguishable
  - Realistic experimental data context with meaningful group differences
  weaknesses:
  - Legend header says Raincloud Components with generic labels but actual legend
    items show condition-specific names like Control (Cloud) which is confusing
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features
  - Implementation header has pre-filled quality score before actual review
  image_description: 'The plot displays a raincloud visualization for four experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) showing reaction time
    data in milliseconds. Each condition has three components: (1) a half-violin "cloud"
    shown on the right side in distinct colors (blue for Control, light blue for Treatment
    A, yellow for Treatment B, gray for Treatment C), (2) a white box plot with black
    outlines in the center showing median, quartiles, and whiskers, and (3) jittered
    data points ("rain") on the left side of each condition. The title "raincloud-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)"
    ranging from 200-700ms, X-axis shows "Experimental Condition". A legend labeled
    "Raincloud Components" in the upper right explains Cloud (Distribution), Stats
    (Box Plot), and Rain (Data Points). Treatment B clearly shows a bimodal distribution
    in its violin shape. The plot has a clean white background with subtle horizontal
    gridlines.'

        comment: Has all three components (cloud, box, rain). However, spec notes
          "cloud on top, rain below" but here cloud is on right, rain on left. For
          vertical orientation spec says "cloud on right side, boxplot centered, rain
          points on left/below" - implementation follows this, but rain is beside
          rather than "below" the boxplot

        comment: Uses go.Violin and go.Box with good hover templates and custom styling.
          However, doesn't leverage Plotly's interactivity features like buttons,
          sliders, or annotations. HTML output is generated but could showcase more
          interactive capabilities
  verdict: APPROVED
