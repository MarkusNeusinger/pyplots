review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with well-proportioned segments and gaps
  - Inner data track effectively shows secondary trade volume information
  - Ribbon bezier curves are smooth and visually appealing with proper transparency
  - Region labels are well-rotated and positioned for readability
  - Tab10 color palette provides good visual distinction between segments
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all visual components
  weaknesses:
  - Title format does not strictly follow the required pattern (spec-id should be
    first, not the descriptive title)
  - Seaborn is only used for theming and color palette, not for actual plotting functions
    - this is a limitation of the library for Circos plots
  - Some ribbons in the center appear quite dense and could benefit from slightly
    more transparency
