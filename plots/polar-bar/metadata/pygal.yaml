review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Radar chart to approximate wind rose visualization
  - Clean blue gradient color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Good stacked layer approach showing wind speed categories
  - Realistic meteorological data showing dominant westerly winds
  - Well-organized legend at bottom with clear category labels including units
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Title should include descriptive name (Polar Bar Chart Wind Rose) not just spec-id
  - Missing axis label or subtitle explaining the radial axis represents wind frequency
  - Cumulative data approach for stacking is confusing - should use actual values
    per category not cumulative totals
  - Square canvas 3600x3600 is acceptable but could better utilize 4800x2700 landscape
    format
