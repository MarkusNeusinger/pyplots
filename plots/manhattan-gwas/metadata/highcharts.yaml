review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Manhattan plot type with cumulative genomic positions and alternating
    chromosome colors (blue/gray)
  - Both genome-wide significance (red dashed at 7.3) and suggestive threshold (blue
    dotted at 5) lines are clearly visible with labels
  - Good data generation showing significant peaks on chromosomes 2, 6, 11, 17 and
    suggestive signals on 4, 8, 15, 20
  - 'Title follows correct format: manhattan-gwas · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Colorblind-safe blue/gray alternating palette avoids red-green issues
  - Reproducible with np.random.seed(42)
  - Clean KISS structure with inline data generation
  weaknesses:
  - 'Marker size (radius: 6) appears slightly small for ~14k data points - could be
    increased to 3-4px for better visibility'
  - Threshold line labels on the right side are somewhat small and could benefit from
    larger font or positioning closer to the line
