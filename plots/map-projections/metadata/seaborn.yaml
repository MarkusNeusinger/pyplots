review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 4 different map projections with mathematically correct
    transformations (Mercator, Mollweide, Robinson, Sinusoidal)
  - Clear visual demonstration of how Tissot indicatrices distort differently in each
    projection
  - Effective use of seaborn DataFrame-based plotting with sns.lineplot for graticules
  - Clean 2x2 comparison layout with informative legend
  - Proper title format and professional appearance
  - Good use of seaborn theme and styling for consistent visual quality
  weaknesses:
  - Coordinate labels present but generic axis labels (Latitude, Longitude) would
    improve clarity
  - Continent outlines are simplified approximations rather than precise boundaries
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid comparing four different map projections:
    Mercator (top-left), Mollweide (top-right), Robinson (bottom-left), and Sinusoidal
    (bottom-right). Each subplot shows simplified continent outlines (North America,
    South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia) in a muted sage green color
    with blue borders, set against a light blue ocean background. Yellow/gold Tissot
    indicatrices (ellipses showing distortion) are distributed across each projection
    at various latitudes (-45°, 0°, 45°) and longitudes (-120°, -60°, 0°, 60°, 120°).
    Gray graticule lines appear at 30° intervals. Each projection is labeled with
    bold text. The main title follows the correct format "map-projections · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". A shared legend at the bottom explains the Tissot Indicatrix, Land,
    and Graticule elements. The layout is clean with good proportions. Latitude labels
    (-60° to 60°) appear on the left of each subplot, and longitude labels (-120°
    to 120°) appear at the bottom.'
