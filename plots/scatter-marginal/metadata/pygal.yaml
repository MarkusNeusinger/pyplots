review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using PIL to composite three separate pygal charts
    into a unified scatter-marginal plot
  - Clean statistics box in corner area provides useful summary (n, r, means)
  - Good color differentiation between main scatter (darker blue) and marginal histograms
    (lighter blue)
  - Proper use of custom styles with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Y marginal histogram bars do not precisely align with the scatter plot Y-axis
    bins
  - Axis labels lack units (could use domain-specific labels)
  - The composite approach results in slight visual discontinuities at chart boundaries
