review:
  strengths:
  - Hand-crafted word positions successfully avoid all text overlaps
  - Clear frequency-based color tier system with four distinct colors
  - Realistic technology survey data with plausible keyword frequencies
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed setting
  - Title follows the required format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow text (#FFD43B) on white background has reduced contrast/readability
  - Legend implemented as text annotations rather than native plotnine legend component
  - Some lower-frequency words appear quite small relative to the canvas size
  - Bottom portion of canvas has more empty space than top, slightly unbalanced
