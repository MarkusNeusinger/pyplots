review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Marimekko chart concept using rect marks with calculated
    x/y positions
  - Proper variable-width bars that correctly represent market size proportions
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Informative tooltips showing region, product, revenue, and percentage
  - Region labels include market size totals for context
  - White stroke between segments provides clear visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are somewhat dense (every 5 units) which could be simplified
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently at 0.3 opacity)
  - Could add value labels on larger segments as suggested in spec notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Marimekko chart showing market share by
    region and product line. Four variable-width bars represent regions: Asia Pacific
    and North America (equal width, $300M each), Europe (slightly narrower, $240M),
    and Latin America (narrowest, $130M). Each bar is subdivided into four colored
    segments representing product lines: Electronics (dark blue #306998), Clothing
    (golden yellow #FFD43B), Food (teal #4ECDC4), and Home (coral/salmon #E76F51).
    The y-axis shows "Product Mix (%)" from 0-100, and region labels with market sizes
    appear below each bar. A legend titled "Product Line" is positioned on the right
    side. The title "marimekko-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.
    White stroke separates segments for clarity.'
