review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent nested donut design showing both detailed holdings and category aggregations
  - mplcursors provides genuine interactivity with informative hover tooltips
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with consistent grouping by asset class
  - Clean center text and well-balanced square layout
  - Comprehensive legend showing all category totals
  weaknesses:
  - Small segments (5% Cash outer ring) are quite thin and harder to interact with
  - Holding labels outside the ring could use slightly larger font for better readability
    at distance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a nested donut chart showing portfolio allocation
    across asset classes. The outer ring shows individual holdings (US Large Cap 25%,
    International 15%, Emerging Markets 8%, Government Bonds 18%, Corporate Bonds
    12%, Real Estate 10%, Commodities 7%, Money Market 5%) with percentage labels
    on each segment and holding names positioned outside the ring. The inner ring
    shows aggregated asset class totals (Equities 48%, Fixed Income 30%, Alternatives
    17%, Cash 5%) with percentage labels. A central white circle contains "Portfolio
    Allocation" text. Colors are grouped by asset class: blues for Equities, greens
    for Fixed Income, browns/oranges for Alternatives, and gray for Cash. A horizontal
    legend at the bottom shows the four categories with their percentages. The title
    "pie-portfolio-interactive · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. White
    edge separators clearly delineate segments.'

        comment: Title, legend, and most labels clearly readable. Inner ring percentages
          and some outer ring labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability.

        comment: Donut segments are well-sized; however, small segments (5% Cash,
          7% Commodities) are somewhat thin on the outer ring.
