review:
  strengths:
  - Correct mathematical formulation of bias-variance tradeoff curves
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with distinct line styles (dashed, dotted, solid)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate title format and axis labeling
  - Custom style with good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - The formula Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error is not visible
    in the rendered plot (multiline title may not be fully supported)
  - Shaded underfitting/overfitting regions are not visible in the output despite
    being coded
  - Legend text appears truncated - the descriptive labels are not fully shown
  - The optimal point vertical line/marker is not clearly visible or distinguishable
  - The x-axis label shows just Model Complexity without the (Low → High) indicator
  image_description: 'The plot displays the bias-variance tradeoff with four curves
    on a white background. The title "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is at the top. The X-axis shows "Model Complexity" ranging from 1 to 10, and the
    Y-axis shows "Prediction Error" ranging from 0 to 4. The curves are: (1) Bias²
    in blue dashed line, decreasing from ~2.9 at low complexity to near 0.5 at high
    complexity; (2) Variance in yellow/gold, increasing from near 0 to ~3 at high
    complexity; (3) Total Error in red solid line showing the characteristic U-shape
    with minimum around complexity 3; (4) Irreducible Error as a horizontal teal/green
    line at ~0.5. The legend at the bottom shows Bias², Variance, Total Error, Irreducible
    Error, and Optimal (complexity=3.1). Grid lines are visible. The formula from
    the spec is NOT visible in the rendered output (it was intended in the title but
    got truncated or not displayed). The shaded regions for underfitting/overfitting
    zones are NOT visible in the plot despite being in the code.'
