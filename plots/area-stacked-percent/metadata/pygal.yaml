review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of 100% stacked area using StackedLine with fill=True
  - Excellent title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-chosen, realistic market share scenario with clear temporal trends
  - Good color palette with five distinguishable colors
  - Clean KISS code structure with no unnecessary complexity
  - Properly outputs both PNG and HTML formats
  - Custom style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range starts at ~40 instead of 0, which can be misleading for percentage
    visualization where the full 0-100% context matters
  - Data is somewhat artificial with perfectly linear trends and static values (Accessories
    at exactly 4% for all years)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing market share
    evolution for five tech product categories from 2018 to 2024. The chart uses five
    distinct colors: deep blue (Smartphones) at the bottom, golden yellow (Laptops),
    teal green (Tablets), coral/salmon (Wearables), and purple (Accessories) at the
    top. The stacked areas always sum to 100%, clearly showing proportional shifts
    over time. The title "area-stacked-percent · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top center. The legend is positioned in the top-left corner with colored squares.
    Y-axis shows "Market Share (%)" ranging from 40-100, and X-axis shows "Year" with
    labels from 2018-2024. Small dots mark data points on the area boundaries. Horizontal
    grid lines are visible at y-axis intervals.'
