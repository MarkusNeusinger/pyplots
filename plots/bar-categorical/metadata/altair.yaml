review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with automatic count aggregation via
    count():Q
  - Smart sorting by count descending using sort="-y" as suggested in spec
  - Tooltips add interactivity for the HTML output
  - Rounded bar corners add visual polish
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizes and label angles for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Category frequency distribution could show more extreme variation to better demonstrate
    the counting feature (e.g., one very rare category)
