review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data variety showing different distribution shapes (normal, skewed,
    bimodal, tight)
  - Creative manual KDE implementation to create proper violin shapes in Altair
  - Good use of layer composition with area marks and circle marks
  - Clean color palette with distinct, accessible colors
  - Interactive tooltips add value
  - Well-formatted title following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Jitter is uniform random rather than true beeswarm algorithm (points not confined
    to violin boundaries)
  - No explicit legend for condition colors (labels partially compensate)
  - Grid only on Y-axis, not configurable via legend
  - strict=True in zip is Python 3.10+ specific
  image_description: 'The plot displays a violin plot with overlaid swarm points showing
    reaction time distributions across four experimental conditions (A, B, C, D).
    Each condition has a distinct colored violin shape with semi-transparent fill:
    Condition A (blue, #306998), Condition B (yellow, #FFD43B), Condition C (light
    blue, #4B8BBE), and Condition D (orange, #E67E22). Dark gray circular points are
    scattered within each violin representing individual data observations. The Y-axis
    shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 220 to 720 ms. The X-axis
    shows condition labels in bold text. The title "violin-swarm · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. A subtle gray grid is visible on the Y-axis. The distributions
    show variety: Condition A has a normal-looking distribution centered around 320ms,
    Condition B shows a gamma-like skewed distribution with higher values, Condition
    C displays a clear bimodal pattern with peaks around 280ms and 380ms, and Condition
    D has a tighter distribution centered around 400ms.'
