quality_score: 52
review:
  strengths:
  - Title formatting follows the required convention
  - Data generation is realistic with correlated price/volume behavior
  - Color scheme provides reasonable differentiation between series
  - RSI correctly bounded to 0-100 range
  weaknesses:
  - Output shows single overlaid chart instead of required multi-chart stacked dashboard
    layout with independent y-axes
  - Normalizing all series to 0-100 defeats the purpose of showing independent scales
  - No synchronized crosshair demonstration in static image
  - Missing visual separation between chart panels as required by spec
  image_description: The plot shows a single combined chart with three data series
    overlaid on a shared axis. The blue line represents "Price (normalized)", the
    gold/yellow spiky line represents "Volume (normalized)", and the red line represents
    "RSI". All three series share the same y-axis scale labeled "Normalized Value"
    ranging from 0 to 100. The x-axis shows "Trading Day" from Day 1 to Day 200 with
    rotated labels. A legend at the bottom identifies each series. The title is correctly
    formatted as "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair · pygal · pyplots.ai".
