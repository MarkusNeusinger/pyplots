review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts-specific pie chart features including slice explosion
    and data label connectors
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between all 5 slices
  - Clean implementation following library best practices with proper container specification
  - 'All spec requirements met: percentage labels, legend, distinct colors, exploded
    slice emphasis'
  - Appropriate square format (3600x3600) chosen for pie chart visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Pie chart positioned at 40% horizontal center creates slight layout imbalance
    with excess whitespace on right
  - Data labels could benefit from slightly larger connector line distance for smaller
    slices
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart with 5 slices representing market
    share distribution. The title "pie-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is shown at
    the top. The pie is positioned slightly left of center with a vertical legend
    on the right side. Colors used are: blue (#306998) for Product A (35.0%), yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Product B (25.0%), purple (#9467BD) for Product C (20.0%), cyan
    (#17BECF) for Product D (12.0%), and brown (#8C564B) for Product E (8.0%). Product
    A (the largest slice) is exploded/offset from the pie for emphasis. Each slice
    has a data label showing the category name and percentage with connector lines.
    The layout uses a square 3600x3600 format appropriate for pie charts.'
