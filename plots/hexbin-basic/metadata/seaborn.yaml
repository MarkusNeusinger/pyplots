review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density visualization
  - Good dataset size (50,000 points) demonstrating hexbin advantage over scatter
    plots
  - Clean code structure with realistic GPS coordinate scenario for urban analytics
  - Appropriate gridsize (35) providing good balance between detail and readability
  - Colorbar clearly labeled with appropriate font sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels show generic X/Y Coordinate instead of Longitude/Latitude matching
    the data context
  - Marginal distributions from JointGrid not visible in final output, reducing seaborn-distinctive
    value
  - Consider log scale for colormap when density varies widely as spec suggests
