review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of real Wine dataset from scikit-learn, providing genuinely realistic
    PCA data
  - Strong visual storytelling with annotated threshold crossings (arrows + diamond
    markers) guiding component selection decisions
  - Dual representation (cumulative line + individual variance bars) effectively communicates
    both perspectives
  - Clean, polished design with softened spines, subtle grid, path effects, and well-chosen
    colors
  - Proper use of matplotlib FuncFormatter for percentage display and annotate with
    arrowprops
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label says 'Explained Variance Ratio (proportion)' but the axis is formatted
    as percentages (0%-100%) — this is an inconsistency that should be resolved (either
    change the label to '(percentage)' or '(%)' or change the formatter to show proportions)
  - The two annotation boxes are slightly cramped in the 8-10 component region, with
    the 90% annotation positioned below the line where it competes with bars — consider
    adjusting placement
  - Legend fontsize=15 instead of the recommended 16 from library rules
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA component selection using the Wine dataset (13 features/components). A
    blue (#306998) line with white-filled circle markers traces the cumulative variance
    from approximately 36% at component 1 up to 100% at component 13. Light blue semi-transparent
    bars beneath the line show individual variance ratios, decreasing from ~36% (component
    1) to near 0% (component 13). Two horizontal dashed threshold lines are drawn:
    a gold/amber line at 90% and a coral/red line at 95%. Diamond markers in matching
    colors highlight the crossing points, with annotated labels reading "8 components
    → 90% variance" and "10 components → 95% variance", each with arrow pointers and
    rounded white-background boxes. The title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Number of Components"
    (1-13) and the y-axis "Explained Variance Ratio (proportion)" formatted as percentages
    (0%-100%). A legend in the lower-right lists all four series. Top and right spines
    are removed, with a subtle y-axis grid.'
