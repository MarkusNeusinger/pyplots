  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements (32pt title, 24pt axis
    labels, 18pt ticks)
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with seasonal pattern (summer peak) and growing
    trend
  - Proper implementation of filled area using fill=tozeroy with appropriate transparency
    (0.35)
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Correct output format (4800x2700 via 1600x900 scale=3) and HTML for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is slightly too subtle - could be 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - Data could show more realistic noise/variability to demonstrate the plot type
    better
  image_description: The plot shows a filled line chart displaying website traffic
    over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The line is rendered in a dark blue color (#306998)
    with a width of 4, and the area beneath it is filled with a semi-transparent light
    blue (rgba with ~0.35 alpha). The chart shows a seasonal pattern with traffic
    starting around 42K in January, rising to a peak of approximately 84K in July,
    then declining through the fall to around 57K in December. The title "line-filled
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray. The y-axis is labeled
    "Website Visitors (thousands)" and ranges from 0 to ~85, while the x-axis is labeled
    "Month" with abbreviated month names. The background is white with subtle gray
    gridlines.
