review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with excellent color choices using Python Blue
    as primary
  - Proper use of matplotlib pie chart API with explode feature
  - Good text sizing and positioning - all labels and percentages highly readable
  - Realistic market share data that demonstrates the exploded pie concept well
  - White edge separators between slices improve visual clarity
  - Legend properly positioned with title
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate exploding multiple slices (e.g., 2 slices) to better showcase
    the feature flexibility
  - Minor layout imbalance with legend placement causing slight asymmetry
  image_description: 'The plot displays an exploded pie chart titled "pie-exploded
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The chart shows market share distribution across 5
    companies: TechCorp (35%, dark blue, exploded/separated from center), DataSoft
    (25%, yellow), CloudNet (18%, green), AIVentures (12%, purple), and Others (10%,
    orange). The TechCorp slice is visually separated from the pie to emphasize the
    market leader. All slices have white edge separators and percentage labels in
    white bold text positioned inside each slice. Category labels are displayed outside
    each slice in black text. A legend box titled "Companies" is positioned to the
    right of the pie chart listing all five categories with their corresponding colors.
    The pie chart uses a square aspect ratio and fills the canvas well.'
