review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent multi-panel layout using gggrid with proper alignment
  - Colorblind-friendly palette applied consistently across all views
  - Effective visual differentiation between selected (high alpha) and unselected
    (low alpha) points
  - Summary panel provides clear selection statistics per cluster
  - 'Good use of lets-plot specific features: layer_tooltips, geom_rect, ggsave with
    scale parameter'
  - Correct title format with proper separator character
  weaknesses:
  - Text sizes could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
    (title 26pt vs recommended 24pt+)
  - Scatter plot legend is hidden; while summary panel compensates, showing cluster
    colors on scatter would help
  - Selection mechanism is static (predetermined brush region) rather than demonstrating
    interactive selection capability
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a coordinated 4-panel dashboard for linked views with selection sync. The layout consists of:

    1. **Top-left: Scatter Plot** - Shows 200 data points in 4 clusters using a colorblind-friendly palette (orange for Cluster A, sky blue for Cluster B, teal for Cluster C, pink for Cluster D). A blue dashed rectangle represents the brush selection area (X: 15-45, Y: 55-85). Selected points (40 total) appear at full opacity while unselected points are faded (low alpha). Title shows "Scatter Plot (40/200 selected)".

    2. **Top-right: Histogram** - Displays the value distribution with selected points shown in blue and unselected in gray. The histogram clearly shows which portions of the value distribution are captured by the selection.

    3. **Bottom-left: Stacked Bar Chart** - Shows category distribution with blue segments representing selected counts and gray for unselected. Shows Cluster A has most selected points (38/50), Cluster C has 2/50, and Clusters B and D have 0/50.

    4. **Bottom-right: Summary Panel** - Displays "Selection Summary 40 of 200 points" with a legend showing each cluster's selection breakdown using colored dots matching the scatter plot.

    The overall title "linked-views-selection · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. All text is legible, colors are distinct and colorblind-friendly, and the layout effectively demonstrates the linked views concept.
