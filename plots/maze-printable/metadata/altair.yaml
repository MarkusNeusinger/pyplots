review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation algorithm (iterative DFS) that guarantees a single solution
    path
  - Clean black-and-white design optimized for printing as specified
  - Well-placed start (S) and goal (G) markers with good color contrast
  - Proper use of Altair layer composition for walls, markers, and title
  - Square canvas format appropriate for maze puzzles
  - Code is clean, well-structured, and reproducible
  weaknesses:
  - S and G markers could be positioned closer to the actual entrance/exit openings
    for better visual connection
  - Could use Altair-specific theming or configure options more extensively
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 cell printable maze puzzle with black
    walls on a white background. The title "maze-printable · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center in black bold text. A blue "S" marker is positioned
    outside the left edge at the start entrance (top-left area), and a blue "G" marker
    is positioned outside the right edge at the goal exit (bottom-right area). The
    maze is algorithmically generated using DFS, showing a complex network of passages.
    The walls are rendered as black rectangles with consistent thickness. The maze
    has clear openings at the start and goal positions. The overall layout is square
    and well-centered on the canvas.
