review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of square figure format (12x12) which is ideal for circular Venn
    diagrams
  - Clear and intuitive color scheme with Python blue (#306998), JavaScript yellow
    (#FFD43B), and SQL cyan (#4ECDC4)
  - Well-organized code with clear variable names explaining each region
  - Appropriate alpha transparency (0.6) that shows overlaps clearly
  - Good use of matplotlib_venn library venn3 function with proper 7-tuple subset
    format
  - Realistic and relatable data context (developer survey about programming languages)
  weaknesses:
  - Figure size uses 12x12 instead of the standard 3600x3600 or 4800x2700 canvas dimensions
  - Could add a brief subtitle or annotation explaining the data context
  - The yellow JavaScript circle could benefit from a slightly darker shade for better
    contrast against white background
