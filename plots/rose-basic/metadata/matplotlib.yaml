review:
  strengths:
  - Clean polar bar implementation with proper theta direction (clockwise from north)
  - Good use of white edge lines to separate segments visually
  - Appropriate canvas size (16x9 at 300dpi = 4800x2700)
  - Realistic monthly rainfall data with clear seasonal pattern
  - Title correctly follows the required format with units
  weaknesses:
  - Radial tick labels overlap slightly with the Feb month label at the top-right
  - No legend or explicit radial axis label explaining that radius = rainfall (mm)
  - Data variation is moderate; more dramatic peaks/valleys would better showcase
    the rose chart format
