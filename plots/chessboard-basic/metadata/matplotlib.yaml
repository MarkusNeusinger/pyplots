review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect implementation of standard chess board conventions (h1 light square)
  - Excellent color scheme with classic cream (#F0D9B5) and brown (#B58863) that provides
    good contrast
  - Clean, readable algebraic notation labels at appropriate font sizes
  - Proper 1:1 aspect ratio maintained with square figure dimensions
  - Subtle border styling with coordinated dark brown color
  - Simple, clean KISS code structure
  weaknesses: []
  image_description: 'The plot displays a classic 8x8 chess board with alternating
    light (cream, #F0D9B5) and dark (brown, #B58863) squares. The board is properly
    oriented with the h1 square being light-colored, following standard chess conventions.
    Row labels (1-8) appear on the left side in bold black text, and column labels
    (a-h) appear at the bottom in bold black text. The board has a dark brown border
    (#5D4037) around all edges with matching thin borders between squares. The title
    "chessboard-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black
    text. The board maintains a perfect 1:1 square aspect ratio with excellent proportions.'
