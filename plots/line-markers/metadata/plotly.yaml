review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent marker visibility with distinct shapes (circle, square, diamond) for
    each series
  - White border lines on markers provide excellent contrast against the lines
  - Clean, professional layout with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Good use of Plotly graph_objects for fine-grained control over styling
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML, showcasing Plotly dual capability
  - Realistic temperature sensor scenario that fits the sparse data use case well
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned outside the plot area (e.g., to the right) to avoid
    any potential overlap with data
  - Hover templates or other interactive features could better showcase Plotly distinctive
    capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays three temperature sensor time series (Sensor
    A, B, C) over 15 hours on a white background. Sensor A (blue circles) shows the
    highest readings peaking around 23.5°C at hour 7 before declining. Sensor B (yellow
    squares) fluctuates in the middle range around 17-20°C. Sensor C (orange/red diamonds)
    trends downward from ~18.5°C to ~15°C. The title "line-markers · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. X-axis shows "Time (hours)" from 0-14 with tick marks
    every 2 hours. Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" from 15-24. Legend is positioned
    in the upper left with a semi-transparent white background. Grid lines are subtle.
    Each series has thick lines (~4px width) with large, clearly visible markers (~16px)
    in distinct shapes.
