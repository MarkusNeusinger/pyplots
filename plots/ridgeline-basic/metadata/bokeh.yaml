review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of manual KDE calculation with Silverman rule for bandwidth
    selection
  - Beautiful color gradient that intuitively maps cold (blue) to warm (yellow/orange)
    temperatures
  - Clean use of Bokeh categorical axis with factor offsets for ridge positioning
  - Proper overlap effect achieved through careful normalization of density curves
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could include y-grid at very low alpha for visual reference
  - The output_file and save calls are somewhat redundant when the primary output
    is PNG via export_png
