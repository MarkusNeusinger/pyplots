review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color contrast between violin fill (Python Blue) and swarm points (Python
    Yellow)
  - Proper transparency on violins (alpha 0.4) allowing points to show through
  - Clean, professional layout with appropriate text sizing for high-resolution output
  - Realistic scientific scenario (dose-response reaction time study)
  - Shows meaningful variation between groups (different means and spreads)
  - Mean lines visible within violins
  weaknesses:
  - Swarm points use uniform random jitter rather than a true swarm algorithm that
    avoids point overlap
  - Could leverage Plotly built-in points parameter in Violin trace instead of manual
    scatter overlay
  - Grid lines are extremely subtle, almost invisible
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots representing reaction time
    distributions (in ms) across four experimental conditions: Control, Low Dose,
    Medium Dose, and High Dose. Each violin is rendered in a semi-transparent light
    blue (Python Blue with ~40% opacity) with a darker blue outline. The mean line
    is shown as a dashed horizontal line within each violin. Yellow circular markers
    with blue outlines are overlaid as swarm points showing individual data points
    (50 per group). The points are horizontally jittered to create a swarm-like effect
    within the violin boundaries. The title follows the correct format "violin-swarm
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" and is centered at the top. Axes are clearly labeled with
    "Experimental Condition" on the x-axis and "Reaction Time (ms)" on the y-axis.
    The background is white with subtle horizontal grid lines. The four groups show
    a clear dose-response pattern with decreasing mean reaction times from Control
    (~430ms) to High Dose (~320ms), and also varying spreads across conditions.'
