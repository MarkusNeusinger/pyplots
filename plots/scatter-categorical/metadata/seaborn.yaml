review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Iris flower dataset context - classic, well-understood scientific
    scenario
  - Perfect text sizing with 24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks - all highly readable
  - Custom colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between categories
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good marker sizing (s=200) and transparency (alpha=0.7) for 150 data points
  - White edge borders on markers improve visibility and separation
  - Three distinct clusters clearly demonstrate categorical grouping
  weaknesses:
  - Grid uses dashed linestyle which is slightly more distracting than solid with
    low alpha
  - Does not utilize seaborn's style parameter to vary marker shapes by category as
    suggested in spec
  - Could use seaborn's built-in 'colorblind' palette instead of custom colors
  image_description: 'The plot shows a categorical scatter plot with Iris-like flower
    measurement data. Three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) are displayed
    using distinct colors: blue (#306998) for Setosa, yellow (#FFD43B) for Versicolor,
    and green (#6A9F58) for Virginica. The X-axis shows "Petal Length (cm)" ranging
    from 1-8, and the Y-axis shows "Petal Width (cm)" ranging from 0-3. The title
    "scatter-categorical · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold.
    A legend in the upper-left corner identifies the three species. The Setosa cluster
    appears tightly grouped in the bottom-left (small petals), Versicolor spans the
    middle region, and Virginica occupies the upper-right (larger petals). A subtle
    dashed grid is present. Points have white edge borders and slight transparency.'

          leverage advanced features like style parameter for marker shapes or seaborn's
          built-in colorblind palette
  verdict: APPROVED
