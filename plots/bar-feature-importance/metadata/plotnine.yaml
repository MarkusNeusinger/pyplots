review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the ggplot2 grammar of graphics paradigm
  - 'Perfect spec compliance with all required features: horizontal bars, sorting,
    gradient colors, error bars, and annotations'
  - Clean visual design with minimal theme and subtle grid lines
  - Realistic ML context with house price prediction features
  - Text annotations positioned well with proper nudge offset
  weaknesses:
  - Could add explicit random seed comment for documentation clarity even with deterministic
    data
