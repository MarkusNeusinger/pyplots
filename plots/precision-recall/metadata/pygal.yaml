review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stepped precision-recall curves showing threshold-based
    nature
  - Comprehensive comparison with two classifiers (Logistic Regression and Random
    Forest) showing different performance levels
  - Proper baseline reference line at positive class ratio (0.31) for random classifier
    comparison
  - Average Precision (AP) scores clearly displayed in legend for each model
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette using Python branding colors (blue, yellow) plus
    red for baseline
  - Good use of pygal-specific features including custom Style and stroke_dasharray
    for dashed baseline
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at top-left instead of bottom as configured (legend_at_bottom=True
    appears ineffective)
  - Minor visual density could be improved with slightly thicker stroke width for
    better curve distinction
