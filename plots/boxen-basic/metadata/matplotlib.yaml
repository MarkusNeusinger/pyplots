review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of boxen plot from scratch using matplotlib patch primitives
  - Clean visual progression of quantile levels with well-chosen color gradient
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all components (median, quantile levels, outliers)
  - Realistic server response time scenario that demonstrates distribution differences
  - Perfect KISS code structure with reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend quantile order could be improved (currently shows IQR first, but visually
    boxes are drawn outer-to-inner)
  - Outlier marker size (s=40) is slightly small for the high-resolution output
  image_description: The plot displays a boxen plot (letter-value plot) with 4 API
    endpoints (Fast API, DB Query, File Upload, Report Gen) on the x-axis and Response
    Time (ms) on the y-axis ranging from 0 to approximately 8500ms. Each category
    shows nested rectangular boxes representing different quantile levels, with boxes
    becoming progressively narrower and darker blue as they represent deeper quantiles.
    The outermost (lightest blue) boxes represent the IQR (25-75%), while inner boxes
    represent 12.5-87.5%, 6.25-93.75%, etc. A bright yellow horizontal line marks
    the median within each category. Dark blue circular outlier points are shown above
    the boxes, particularly visible for File Upload and Report Gen categories. The
    legend in the upper right explains all quantile levels, the median, and outliers.
    The title follows the correct format "boxen-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
