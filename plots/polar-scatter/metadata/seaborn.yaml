review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar coordinates with correct theta_zero_location
    (North) and clockwise direction
  - Realistic wind data with distinct prevailing directions for morning (SW) and afternoon
    (NE)
  - Good color choice with blue/yellow palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Clean title format following the required specification
  - Appropriate use of seaborn scatterplot with hue parameter for categorical encoding
  - Well-sized markers and good alpha transparency for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - The radial axis label Wind Speed (m/s) is placed as rotated text at an awkward
    angle and overlaps with some data points
  - Figure size uses 12x12 (square) which is acceptable but the library rules suggest
    16x9 landscape as the standard format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar scatter chart with wind measurement
    data. The chart shows data points in two colors: blue (#306998) for Morning observations
    clustered around the SW direction (around 225°), and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for
    Afternoon observations clustered around the NE direction (around 45°). The radial
    axis represents wind speed in m/s, ranging from 0 to approximately 35. Cardinal
    and intercardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) are labeled around the
    perimeter. The plot has a light gray background (#f8f9fa) with subtle dashed gridlines.
    A legend in the upper right shows "Time of Day" with Morning (blue) and Afternoon
    (yellow) markers. The title "polar-scatter · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in bold. A "Wind Speed (m/s)" label is positioned diagonally at approximately
    60° direction.'

        comment: Markers at s=150 with alpha=0.7 are appropriately sized for 120 data

          though legend placement at bbox_to_anchor=(1.15, 1.0) adds extra margin

        comment: Wind speeds of 3-35 m/s are realistic, though the highest values
          (~35 m/s = ~126 km/h) are approaching storm-force winds which is at the
          edge of typical observational data

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with hue parameter for categorical coloring
          and palette support, but doesn't leverage other seaborn features like jointplot,
          pairplot or statistical capabilities. The implementation is essentially
          matplotlib polar with seaborn's scatterplot layered on top.
  verdict: APPROVED
