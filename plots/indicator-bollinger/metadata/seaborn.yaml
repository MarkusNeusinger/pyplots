review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with prominent close price line and distinct SMA styling
    (dashed yellow)
  - Proper implementation of Bollinger Bands with semi-transparent fill between bands
  - Realistic stock price data with volatility clustering periods
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color differentiation between elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows separate entries for upper and lower bands using same color - could
    combine or differentiate
  - Grid styling is adequate but legend placement could be optimized
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bollinger Bands technical indicator chart
    for stock price data spanning from early February 2024 to June 2024. The chart
    shows a prominent black line representing the close price that fluctuates between
    approximately $125-165. A light blue semi-transparent fill area represents the
    Bollinger Band range (volatility envelope) between the upper and lower bands.
    The upper and lower bands are drawn as solid blue lines at the edges of the shaded
    region, with labels showing "+2σ" and "-2σ" respectively. A yellow dashed line
    represents the 20-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) running through the middle of
    the bands. The title "indicator-bollinger · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    prominently at the top. Axis labels show "Date" on x-axis and "Price ($)" on y-axis
    with proper units. A well-positioned legend in the upper left corner explains
    all five elements: Bollinger Band Range, Upper Band (+2σ), Lower Band (-2σ), 20-Day
    SMA, and Close Price.'
