review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean sorted descending layout makes frequency comparison intuitive
  - Realistic electronics product category scenario with weighted probability distribution
  - Value labels on top of each bar enhance readability without cluttering
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive pygal features (e.g., custom tooltips with percentage,
    value_formatter showing both count and percentage)
  - Color variety could be added to distinguish high vs low frequency categories
