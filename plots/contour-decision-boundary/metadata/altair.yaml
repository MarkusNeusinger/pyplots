review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of layered Altair charts to combine decision regions, correctly
    classified points, and incorrectly classified points
  - Creative approach using mark_rect with binning to approximate decision boundary
    visualization (Altair lacks native contour support)
  - Clear visual distinction between correctly classified (circles) and incorrectly
    classified (triangles with red stroke) points
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette using Python blue (#306998) and gold (#FFD43B)
  - Interactive tooltips enabled for data exploration
  - Comprehensive legend system explaining all visual encodings
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses regular middle dot instead of proper unicode character
  - Axis labels lack units (could use Feature X1 normalized or similar)
  - The shape legend uses a workaround with invisible points which works but is not
    idiomatic Altair
