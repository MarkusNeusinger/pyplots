review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    with proper physics simulation
  - 'Good use of Bokeh interactive features: hover tooltips showing team, node ID,
    and connections'
  - Clear visual separation of three communities through both color and spatial positioning
  - Node sizing scaled by degree effectively highlights hub nodes
  - Proper colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be integrated better within the plot area rather than added
    as separate layout
  - Some peripheral nodes appear quite small at the edges of communities
