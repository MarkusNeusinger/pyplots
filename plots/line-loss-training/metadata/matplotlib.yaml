review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of overfitting pattern with clear divergence between training
    and validation loss
  - Optimal early stopping point annotation is well-executed with arrow and styled
    bbox
  - Color choices (blue and yellow) are colorblind-safe and provide excellent contrast
  - Clean KISS structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - All specification requirements are met including distinct colors, legend, and
    loss function labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper right slightly overlaps with early epoch data points;
    consider upper center or outside plot
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like fill_between for confidence intervals
    or secondary annotations
