review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar stacked bar chart following meteorological conventions
    (North at top, clockwise direction)
  - Realistic wind data simulation using Weibull distribution with prevailing SW winds
    and secondary NW pattern
  - Clean color progression from cool blues (calm) to warm yellows/oranges (strong)
    matching spec requirements
  - Clear 16-sector direction binning with proper wrap-around handling at 0/360 degrees
  - Well-sized text throughout with bold direction labels for readability
  - White edge separation between stacked bar segments improves visual distinction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement at (-0.15, -0.15) causes it to float isolated in the lower-left
    corner rather than being positioned closer to the plot area
  - The 15+ m/s (red) speed category is present in legend but barely visible in data,
    making the legend somewhat misleading about what speeds are actually represented
  image_description: The wind rose plot displays a polar histogram showing wind direction
    and speed distribution. North is positioned at the top with 16 compass direction
    labels (N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW) arranged
    around the perimeter in bold black text. The radial axis shows frequency percentages
    from 0% to 18% with concentric dashed circles. Each spoke represents a direction
    sector with stacked colored bars indicating wind speed ranges. The color scheme
    progresses from dark blue (0-3 m/s) through lighter blues (3-6, 6-9 m/s) to yellow
    (9-12 m/s) and orange (12-15 m/s), with red (15+ m/s) shown in the legend but
    barely visible in the data. The dominant winds are from the SW-W-WNW-NW sectors,
    showing a clear prevailing westerly pattern. A legend box in the lower-left corner
    shows "Wind Speed" with all six speed ranges. The title "windrose-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3) which is good, but legend placement at
          bbox_to_anchor=(-0.15, -0.15) causes it to float isolated in corner rather
          than being positioned closer to the plot area

        comment: Uses matplotlib's polar projection correctly with set_theta_zero_location
          and set_theta_direction, but this is basic polar chart functionality rather
          than advanced matplotlib features
  verdict: APPROVED
