review:
  strengths:
  - Good visual design with clear color gradient and cell borders
  - Realistic website engagement scenario with meaningful data patterns
  - Interactive HTML version includes hover tooltips, zoom, pan, and reset functionality
  - Colorbar with descriptive title Engagement Score
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Implementation does NOT use pygal library - constructs raw SVG manually
    instead of using pygal chart classes'
  - Contains a helper function interpolate_color() which violates KISS principle (no
    functions/classes rule)
  - Does not import pygal despite being a pygal implementation
  - Interactivity features (spec requirements) only exist in HTML output, not demonstrable
    in static PNG
  - Pygal has no native heatmap chart type - may need to consider if this is feasible
    with pygal
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 20×20 interactive heatmap representing website
    page engagement scores across user segments. The visualization uses a blue-to-orange
    colormap with light blue for low values (around 2) and bright orange for high
    values (up to 98). Row labels (Page 1-20) appear on the left Y-axis, and column
    labels (Segment 1-20) are rotated 45 degrees on the X-axis. A vertical colorbar
    on the right shows "Engagement Score" with values 2, 50, and 98 marked. The heatmap
    shows distinct high-engagement clusters (orange/yellow regions) in rows 3-6/columns
    4-8, rows 11-14/columns 13-17, and rows 16-18/columns 2-5. Hot spots appear at
    corners and scattered positions. Cell borders are white, providing clear separation.
    The title follows the correct format: "heatmap-interactive · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
