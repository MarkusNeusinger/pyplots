review:
  strengths:
  - Correct ECDF implementation with proper step-after interpolation
  - Excellent text sizing (title 28pt, labels 22pt, ticks 18pt) for high readability
  - Proper Y-axis scale fixed to 0-1 range as required by spec
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principles
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax with proper encoding types
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha 0.3, dashed) aids percentile reading without being
    distracting
  - Appropriate data size (200 points) for ECDF visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could be "Value (units)" instead of just "Value")
  - Data uses generic normal distribution rather than a real-world scenario context
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like interactive selections or layered
    annotations
  image_description: The plot displays a basic ECDF with a blue step line (#306998)
    on a white background. The x-axis is labeled "Value" and ranges from approximately
    10 to 98. The y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" and ranges from 0.00 to
    1.00 with increments of 0.05. The title "ecdf-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center. Subtle dashed grid lines aid in reading values. The step function
    shows the characteristic S-curve shape of a normal distribution, starting near
    0 on the left, rising through the middle values, and approaching 1.0 on the right.
    The line uses step-after interpolation, creating the proper staircase pattern
    expected from an ECDF.
