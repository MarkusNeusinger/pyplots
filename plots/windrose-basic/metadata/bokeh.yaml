review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate handling by manually constructing wedge polygons with
    proper angular math
  - Clean stacking of speed bins from center outward with cumulative radius calculation
  - Good use of Bokeh's ColumnDataSource and patches for complex polygon rendering
  - Realistic coastal wind data with Weibull distribution for wind speeds
  - Color palette progresses logically from cool to warm representing increasing wind
    intensity
  - Proper meteorological convention with North at top and clockwise direction progression
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small relative to the plot size (18pt vs 22pt direction labels)
  - The percentage labels on the concentric circles could be larger for better readability
  - Missing explicit Frequency (%) label for the radial axis
