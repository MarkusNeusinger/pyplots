review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sparkline minimalism - no axes, gridlines, or labels as spec requires
  - Perfect 4:1 aspect ratio ideal for sparkline visualization
  - Good use of colored markers to highlight min (red) and max (green) points
  - First and last points highlighted for reference as spec suggests
  - Clean data generation with realistic website traffic scenario including trend
    and seasonality
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size could be slightly larger for the 4800x1200 canvas
  - Consider using ColumnDataSource for better Bokeh idiom (minor)
