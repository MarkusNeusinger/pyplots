review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's layered composition combining price line, connectors,
    flags, and labels
  - Smart alternating flag positions (above/below) to avoid obscuring price data
  - Strong interactive features with detailed tooltips showing date, event type, label,
    and price
  - Colorblind-accessible design using both color AND shape to distinguish event types
  - Clean data pipeline with proper date handling and nearest-date matching for events
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap in the August 2024 region between "2:1 Stock Split" and "Q2
    Strong Growth"
  - Grid is almost invisible (gridOpacity=0.3 may be too subtle)
  - Title uses Unicode middle dot which may render inconsistently
  image_description: 'The plot shows a stock price line chart spanning January 2024
    to September 2024. The price line is rendered in blue (#306998) with moderate
    thickness. Eight events are marked with distinctive flag-style markers connected
    to the price line via vertical dashed gray connector lines. Event types are differentiated
    by both color and shape: Earnings (blue triangles), Dividend (green diamonds),
    News (yellow circles), and Split (red square). Event labels appear above each
    marker in matching colors. The title "stock-event-flags · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. A legend for "Event Type" is positioned in the upper right.
    X-axis shows dates formatted as "Mon Year" at -45° angle. Y-axis shows "Stock
    Price ($)" ranging from ~76 to ~114. The layout uses the full canvas width with
    good proportions.'
