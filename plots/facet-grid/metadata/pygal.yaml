review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of faceted grid layout using creative PIL-based composition
    approach
  - Clear, readable labels with proper units (Height in cm, Days)
  - Consistent shared y-axis range across all facets for easy comparison
  - Realistic plant growth scenario with meaningful variation between conditions
  - Clean color scheme using pyplots primary blue (#306998)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently visible but acceptable)
  - The faceted composition relies heavily on PIL rather than pygal native features
    - this is a reasonable workaround given pygal limitations
  - Row labels could be slightly larger for better visibility
