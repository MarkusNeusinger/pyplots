review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of violin plot with bimodal Sales distribution showing
    the power of KDE visualization
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter and legend=False
  - Clear quartile markers inside violins (inner="quart") as spec requires
  - Well-formatted currency axis with $Xk notation
  - Good color contrast with blue/gold alternating palette
  weaknesses:
  - Alternating colors by department do not add informational value; a single color
    or gradient by position would be cleaner
  - Could use inner="quartile" to show individual quartile lines more distinctly,
    or add miniature box plots with inner="box"
  - Missing y-axis grid extension through violins (grid only on axis area)
  image_description: The plot displays four violin plots comparing salary distributions
    across four departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). The violins
    alternate in color between a muted blue (#306998) and golden yellow (#FFD43B).
    Each violin shows the kernel density estimation with mirrored sides, clearly revealing
    distribution shapes. Inside each violin, dotted lines indicate quartiles (Q1,
    Q3) and a dashed line shows the median. The y-axis displays "Salary ($)" with
    currency formatting ranging from $20k to $120k. The x-axis shows "Department"
    with category labels. The title correctly follows the format "violin-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". The Sales department violin clearly shows a bimodal distribution
    (two peaks around $55k and $90k), demonstrating the ability to reveal complex
    distribution shapes. A subtle horizontal grid with alpha=0.3 aids readability.
