review:
  strengths:
  - 'Full spec compliance: all required features present (ECDFs, K-S statistic, p-value,
    max divergence highlight, clear legend)'
  - Excellent data storytelling with annotated max divergence point creating a clear
    visual focal point
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario with appropriate value ranges
  - Good use of seaborn ecdfplot for the ECDF curves
  weaknesses:
  - Consider adding a shaded/filled region between the two ECDF curves at the point
    of maximum divergence to enhance visual storytelling
  - The annotation box and arrow could be more visually refined (e.g., softer colors,
    better positioning to avoid slight visual clutter near the vertical line)
  - Color palette could use higher contrast between the two distributions for improved
    accessibility
  - Axis labels lack units — Credit Score (points) would be more informative
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution function
    (ECDF) curves comparing credit score distributions for "Good Customers" (blue,
    #306998) and "Bad Customers" (coral/orange, #E3724B). The x-axis shows "Credit
    Score" ranging from approximately 350 to 950, and the y-axis shows "Cumulative
    Proportion" from 0.0 to 1.0. A dashed vertical black line at approximately credit
    score 660 highlights the point of maximum divergence between the two distributions.
    Two black dots with white edges mark where this vertical line intersects each
    ECDF curve. An annotation box with a rounded border and arrow displays "K-S Statistic
    = 0.717" and "p-value = 5.46e-60". The legend in the upper left clearly labels
    both distributions. Top and right spines are removed, subtle y-axis grid lines
    are present, and the title reads "Credit Score Distributions · ks-test-comparison
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
