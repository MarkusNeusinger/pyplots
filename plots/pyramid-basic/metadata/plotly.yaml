review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear pyramid shape and symmetric axis presentation
  - Smart use of negative values for left-extending bars creates proper butterfly
    layout
  - Custom hover templates with formatted population numbers enhance interactivity
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast between blue and yellow
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic demographic data showing expected patterns (female longevity, working-age
    bulge)
  weaknesses:
  - Could add annotations to highlight key insights (e.g., gender ratio differences
    in elderly groups)
  - Population scale could be documented in code comments for context
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid (butterfly chart) showing
    population distribution by age group and gender. The chart uses a horizontal bar
    layout with blue bars (Male) extending to the left from a central axis and yellow/gold
    bars (Female) extending to the right. There are 9 age groups from "0-9" at the
    bottom to "80+" at the top. The x-axis shows "Population (thousands)" with symmetric
    tick labels (5,000 to 0 to 5,000). The y-axis shows "Age Group". The title reads
    "Population Distribution · pyramid-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top, with
    a horizontal legend showing Male (blue) and Female (yellow) below the title. The
    layout uses the plotly_white template with subtle gridlines. The pyramid shape
    is clearly visible with younger and middle age groups having larger bars, tapering
    at both youngest (0-9) and oldest (80+) groups.

        comment: Good use of hovertemplate with customdata for interactive hover,
          write_html for interactivity, but could leverage more Plotly features like
          annotations
