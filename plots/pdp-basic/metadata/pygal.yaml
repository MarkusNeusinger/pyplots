review:
  strengths:
  - Clear monotonic PDP relationship that effectively demonstrates feature impact
    on predictions
  - Proper implementation of confidence intervals using individual predictions
  - Good use of rug plot to show training data distribution
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Correct use of sklearn partial_dependence API with both average and individual
    kinds
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend dots are small and hard to distinguish at the bottom of the chart
  - Rug plot points could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
  - Grid styling is functional but the legend positioning creates visual separation
    from the data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) with a white
    background on a 16:9 canvas. The title "pdp-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in dark gray text. The main visualization shows three lines: a solid
    dark blue line for "Partial Dependence", and two dashed lines in lighter colors
    (gold/yellow for "95% CI Upper" and light blue for "95% CI Lower"). The x-axis
    is labeled "Room Size (standardized)" ranging from approximately -2.4 to 2.4,
    and the y-axis shows "Partial Dependence" ranging from -30 to 30. The PDP curve
    shows a monotonic increasing relationship - as room size increases, the partial
    dependence increases from about -30 to +25. A rug plot showing training data distribution
    appears at the bottom with small red/maroon dots. The legend is positioned at
    the bottom with four entries. Light gray grid lines appear in the background.
    All text is clearly readable.'
