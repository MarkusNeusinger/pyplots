review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with proper seed and well-organized statistics calculation
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, factor_cmap, Whisker model'
  - 'All spec requirements met: median, outliers at 1.5xIQR, different colors per
    category'
  - Explicit font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriate sizes
  - Realistic educational context (test scores across classes) with varied distributions
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh web-native strength
  weaknesses:
  - 'Canvas utilization is poor: narrow boxes with excessive horizontal whitespace
    on a wide 16:9 canvas. Either widen boxes (width=0.7+) or consider square format'
  - Median line rendered as p.rect(height=0.5) creates an overly thick chunky black
    bar instead of a clean thin median line — visually distracting and imprecise
  - 'No data storytelling: no annotations highlighting Class C extreme spread, Class
    B tight clustering, or any interpretive guidance for the viewer'
  - HoverTool is added but serves no purpose in the static PNG output — dead functionality
    in the reviewed artifact
  image_description: The plot displays four box-and-whisker plots comparing test score
    distributions across Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D. The boxes are colored
    blue (#306998), light blue (#4B8BBE), orange/gold (#E5A03A), and olive green (#7A9E3D)
    respectively. Each box shows the interquartile range with a thick black median
    line rendered as a rectangle. Whiskers extend to 1.5xIQR fences with horizontal
    caps, and outliers appear as open white circles with dark outlines. The title
    "box-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is positioned in the top-left. The x-axis is
    labeled "Class" and y-axis "Test Score (points)". Horizontal dashed grid lines
    are subtle, vertical grid is removed, and top/right spines are removed. There
    is significant horizontal whitespace between the relatively narrow boxes. Class
    B has a tight, high distribution (~85); Class C has the widest spread (~68 center)
    with an extreme low outlier near y=10; Class A is moderate (~75); Class D is moderate
    (~78) with outliers both above 100 and below 45.
