review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of mplcursors library to provide true hover interactivity beyond
    static matplotlib
  - Well-designed demo tooltip annotation showing what users would see on hover
  - Realistic server monitoring data scenario with daily/weekly patterns and anomaly
    detection
  - Three distinct anomaly annotations with clear visual hierarchy (red triangular
    markers)
  - Helpful interactive controls footer explaining zoom/pan/reset functionality
  - Good visual demonstration of range selection region with teal highlight
  weaknesses:
  - The interactive controls footer text overlaps slightly with the x-axis Time label
    - needs more bottom margin separation
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is slightly too prominent for an already busy chart with multiple
    annotations
  - Legend could be more compact - Data Points hover enabled is verbose and mplcursors
    enabled title adds clutter
