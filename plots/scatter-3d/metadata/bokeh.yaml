review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution for 3D in a 2D library using isometric projection
    with proper rotation matrices
  - Depth sorting and size variation create effective pseudo-3D depth perception
  - Clean implementation of custom 3D axis lines with arrows
  - Viridis colormap effectively adds fourth dimension (Z-value) encoding
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource and Bokeh idioms
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Marker sizes (15-35px) are slightly small for optimal visibility at 4800x2700;
    could be increased to 25-50px
  - Colorbar title is somewhat generic; could clarify relationship to Z-axis
  - Grid is visible in the 2D projection space which slightly conflicts with the 3D
    axis visualization aesthetic
