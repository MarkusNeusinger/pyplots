review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Titanic dataset providing realistic, well-known categorical data
    with meaningful dimensions
  - Clear color scheme with blue/yellow contrast that is colorblind-friendly
  - Good use of Plotly Parcats with smooth hspline ribbons and interactive hover features
  - Title follows correct format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Helpful annotation explaining color meaning at the bottom of the plot
  weaknesses:
  - The Did Not Survive label on the right side is slightly cut off - consider adjusting
    margins or abbreviating
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel categories diagram visualizing
    Titanic passenger data across four categorical dimensions. From left to right:
    **Passenger Class** (First, Second, Third), **Sex** (Female, Male), **Embarked**
    (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton), and **Outcome** (Survived, Did Not Survive).
    Ribbons flow between categories using smooth hspline curves. The color scheme
    uses **Python Blue (#306998)** for passengers who did not survive and **bright
    yellow (#FFD43B)** for survivors. The title "Titanic Passengers · parallel-categories-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A helpful annotation at the bottom
    explains the color encoding. The layout is well-balanced with adequate margins,
    though the "Did Not Survive" label on the far right is slightly truncated.'
