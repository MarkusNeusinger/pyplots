review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative layering to combine violin (mark_area with
    transform_density) and box plot layers
  - Realistic and varied data showing different distribution shapes (exponential,
    normal, tight normal, bimodal)
  - Clean faceted layout with independent x-scales for proper violin centering
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper title format and clear axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Box plot median line could have higher contrast against the gray box for better
    visibility
  - Legend placement in top-right leaves some empty space; could be integrated more
    tightly
