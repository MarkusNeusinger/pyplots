review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    from scratch
  - Clear community clustering visible in the final visualization
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot with hue and size parameters for node differentiation
  - Realistic organizational network scenario with meaningful department structure
  - Well-designed legend with department names and counts
  - Network statistics annotation adds informative context
  - Appropriate edge styling with weight-based thickness and transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Some minor label overlap in dense node regions
  - Grid is absent but could be argued as appropriate for network visualization
  - Force layout is custom code rather than leveraging a network-specific library
    feature
