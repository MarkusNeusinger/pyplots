review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the crossword grid with proper 180-degree rotational
    symmetry
  - Clean, professional monochrome design optimized for printing
  - Correct numbering algorithm identifying word start positions
  - Good use of Altair layer composition (cells + numbers)
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Number positioning could be slightly more consistent (dx/dy values work but are
    approximations)
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with the standard
    newspaper-style layout. White cells are entry cells for letters, and black cells
    are blocking cells. The black cells follow traditional 180-degree rotational symmetry.
    Clue numbers (1-79) are positioned in the top-left corner of cells that start
    across or down words. The grid uses a monochrome color scheme with white (#ffffff)
    entry cells and dark (#1a1a1a) blocking cells. Clear dark gray grid lines (#333333)
    separate all cells. The title "crossword-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered above the grid in bold text. The overall layout is clean, professional,
    and suitable for printing.
