review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of real-time data concept
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features (annotations, plot bands, area gradient)
  - Clear indication of scrolling direction with arrows
  - Current value prominently displayed with red marker
  - Color zones help interpret CPU load levels
  weaknesses:
  - '**CRITICAL: Implementation file not committed to PR branch**'
  - Cannot verify code quality without source file
  - Cannot verify reproducibility (seed usage)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a real-time line chart visualization titled "line-realtime
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai". It displays simulated CPU usage data over time with
    the following visual elements:

    - **Title**: Properly formatted as `{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai`

    - **Subtitle**: Shows "🔴 LIVE · CPU Usage: 48.8% · Last updated: 14:30:45"

    - **Chart type**: Area spline chart with gradient fill (blue color #306998)

    - **X-axis**: Time in HH:MM:SS format with datetime axis

    - **Y-axis**: CPU Usage (%) from 0-100%

    - **Data**: ~100 data points showing CPU usage fluctuating between 27-72%

    - **Annotations**: Two callouts - "← Older data scrolls off" on the left and "New
    data arrives →" on the right

    - **Current value indicator**: Red dot at the rightmost point showing current
    value (48.8%)

    - **Plot bands**: Subtle color zones (green for 0-50%, yellow for 50-75%, red
    for 75-100%)

    - **Legend**: Shows "CPU Usage" and "Current: 48.8%" on the right side'
  verdict: REJECTED
