review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements the skewed temperature axis transformation
  - Includes all major reference lines (isotherms, dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing
    ratio)
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with appropriate pressure levels
  - Good color choices for distinguishing temperature from dewpoint profile
  - Proper logarithmic and inverted pressure axis
  weaknesses:
  - No seaborn plotting functions used - only sns.set_theme() for styling, all actual
    plotting uses matplotlib (ax.plot). This violates AR-05 library usage requirement.
  - Y-axis tick labels overlap at 900/925 hPa
  - Reference line labels at top edge could be better positioned
  - Title dot character may have rendering issues
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a
    light gray (#fafafa) background. The Y-axis shows pressure (hPa) on a logarithmic
    scale, inverted from 1000 hPa at the bottom to 100 hPa at the top. The X-axis
    shows temperature in °C ranging from -50 to 50. Temperature profile is shown as
    a solid red line with circular markers, and dewpoint profile as a dashed blue
    line with square markers. The diagram includes multiple reference lines: light
    gray isotherms (skewed at 45°), brown/tan dry adiabats, green dashed moist adiabats,
    and blue dotted mixing ratio lines. Labels for "Dry Adiabats", "Moist Adiabats",
    "Mixing Ratio", and "Isotherms" appear at the top/right edges. The legend is positioned
    in the upper right corner. The title follows the correct format "skewt-logp-atmospheric
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
