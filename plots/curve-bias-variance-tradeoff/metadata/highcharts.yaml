review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all four theoretical curves with mathematically correct
    relationships
  - Shaded underfitting/overfitting zones with clear labels add educational value
  - Formula displayed in subtitle as specified
  - Optimal complexity point clearly marked with both vertical line and scatter marker
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features (plotBands, plotLines)
  - Clean, well-organized code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Zone labels at the bottom are relatively small and could be more prominent
  - Legend could potentially be integrated into the plot via direct curve labels instead
    of external legend
  image_description: 'The plot displays the bias-variance tradeoff visualization with
    four smooth curves on a white background. The chart has a clear title "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top, with the formula subtitle "Total Error
    = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error" below it. The X-axis shows "Model Complexity"
    (0-10), and the Y-axis shows "Prediction Error" (0-3.5). Four curves are displayed:
    (1) Bias² in blue - decreasing curve starting high at ~1.9 and decreasing to ~0.3;
    (2) Variance in yellow - increasing curve starting near 0 and rising to ~3.2;
    (3) Irreducible Error in purple dotted line - constant horizontal line at 0.3;
    (4) Total Error in red - U-shaped curve with minimum around complexity 2.5. A
    green diamond marker indicates the optimal point where total error is minimized.
    The plot features shaded regions: light blue for "Underfitting (High Bias)" zone
    on the left and light yellow for "Overfitting (High Variance)" zone on the right.
    A dashed green vertical line marks the optimal complexity point with a label.
    The legend is positioned on the right side showing all five series.'
