review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (Python Blue + orange) with strong contrast
  - Proper annotation of the maxima at p=0.5 with markers and vertical guide line
  - Correct mathematical computation with proper edge case handling at p=0 and p=1
  - Legend includes full formulas for both metrics as requested by the spec
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entry for entropy formula wraps to two lines, making it slightly cramped
    and harder to read
  - The visual design, while clean, lacks the extra polish to reach publication quality
    (e.g., could use subtle shading between curves to emphasize the difference)
  - No storytelling about the practical implication — could add a subtitle or annotation
    explaining why both criteria yield similar tree structures
  - The annotation 'Both maxima at p = 0.5' is slightly misleading since the maxima
    are at different y-values (0.5 vs 1.0) — the phrasing could be more precise
  image_description: The plot displays two smooth curves on a clean white background
    with subtle gray gridlines. The blue curve (#306998) represents Gini impurity
    (2p(1−p)), peaking at 0.5 on the y-axis. The orange curve (#e07a2f) represents
    Entropy (−p log₂p − (1−p) log₂(1−p)), peaking at 1.0 on the y-axis. Both curves
    are symmetric around p=0.5 and start/end at 0. A dotted vertical gray line marks
    x=0.5. Two open circle markers (white fill, dark stroke) sit at the maxima points
    (0.5, 1.0) and (0.5, 0.5). An annotation reads "Both maxima at p = 0.5" positioned
    to the right of the upper marker. The legend at the bottom shows both metric names
    with their formulas. The title reads "line-impurity-comparison · letsplot · pyplots.ai".
    X-axis is labeled "Probability (p)" with ticks from 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments.
    Y-axis is labeled "Impurity Measure" with ticks from 0 to 1 in 0.2 increments.
