review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom grid layout with CSS Grid demonstrating colspan/rowspan effectively
  - Dashboard-style visualization with a large main chart (2x2) and 4 detail views
    (1x1 each)
  - Perfect colorblind-safe palette with 5 distinct colors
  - All text is highly legible with appropriately sized fonts for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic financial data scenario with coherent relationships between charts
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text sizes are disproportionately small compared to the chart titles and
    should be increased for better readability
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library API (Chart, HighchartsOptions
    classes) as recommended in the library guidelines; instead manually constructs
    JavaScript configurations
