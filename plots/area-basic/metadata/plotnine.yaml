  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all font sizes explicitly configured for 4800x2700
    output
  - Strong data storytelling with three well-placed annotations (Peak, Maintenance,
    LOWESS trend)
  - Idiomatic plotnine grammar with layered geom composition (geom_area + geom_line
    + geom_smooth)
  - Realistic, well-constructed synthetic data with trend, seasonality, noise, and
    anomaly
  - Good color harmony between Python Blue area/line and gold LOWESS trend line
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Maintenance annotation in gray (#666666) has low contrast — consider using a darker
    color or adding a background box
  - 'Annotations lack concrete values — Peak: 8,234 visitors would be more informative
    than just Peak'
  - No gradient fill from bottom to line (spec suggests this for visual appeal)
  - Could benefit from a subtitle providing narrative context (e.g., Upward trend
    with weekly cycles and a mid-month maintenance dip)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart of daily website visitors
    over January 2024. The filled area uses a muted Python Blue (#306998) with semi-transparency
    (alpha ~0.35), topped by a darker blue outline (line width 1.5). A gold/yellow
    LOWESS trend line smoothly overlays the data, showing the overall upward trajectory.
    Three text annotations guide the viewer: "Peak" in bold blue near the top-right
    marking the maximum (~8,200 visitors), "Maintenance" in italic gray around Jan
    15 where a clear dip occurs (~3,300 visitors), and "Trend (LOWESS)" in bold gold
    labeling the smooth curve. The title reads "area-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The x-axis shows "Date (January 2024)" with formatted date labels
    (Jan 01, 08, 15, 22, 29). The y-axis shows "Daily Visitors (count)" with comma-formatted
    numbers (0 to 8,000). Gridlines are subtle light gray. The layout fills the 16:9
    canvas well with balanced margins. Data exhibits a weekly cyclical pattern with
    an upward trend.'
