review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean, readable node labels positioned inside circles with bold text
  - Proper use of Bokeh Arrow and NormalHead for directed edges
  - Well-implemented legend with background box for clarity
  - Realistic software dependency scenario matching spec application
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs leverage Bokeh capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Edge shortening calculations could be improved for more consistent arrow-to-node
    spacing
  - No curved edges for potential bidirectional relationships
