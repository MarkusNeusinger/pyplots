review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with all features (270-degree layout, rings, sectors,
    labels, legend, background fills)
  - Excellent data quality with 26 realistic, current technology items in plausible
    time horizons
  - Marker size hierarchy by ring creates effective visual storytelling (near-term
    = bold)
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-distinctive features: HoverTool with tooltips, dual HTML+PNG
    export, ColumnDataSource'
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Label crowding in the inner Adopt ring where K8s GitOps, RAG Pipelines, LLM Agents,
    and the ring label itself compete for space
  - Significant wasted canvas space at the bottom (~20% empty below Biotech sector
    label); the radar chart could be better centered or the y_range adjusted
  - Ring boundary aesthetics could be stronger (e.g., alternating fill contrast, or
    sector-colored subtle backgrounds to improve visual grouping)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-quarter circle (270 degree) radar
    chart on a 3600x3600 square canvas with a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. Four
    concentric rings represent time horizons: Adopt (innermost, largest markers),
    Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost, smallest markers). Rings have subtle pastel
    background fills (blue-gray, light gray, warm beige, light pink) separated by
    dotted gray boundary lines. Four sectors divide the angular space: AI & ML (blue,
    upper-right), Cloud & Infra (orange, left), Sustainability (teal, lower-left),
    and Biotech (purple, bottom). Sector headers are displayed in their respective
    colors outside the outermost ring. Ring names (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold) appear
    along the upper-right radial boundary with white background fill. 26 technology
    items are plotted as colored circle markers with white edges, each labeled in
    dark text. Marker sizes decrease from inner to outer rings, creating visual hierarchy.
    A legend in the top-right corner maps colors to sectors. The title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Notable: the bottom ~20% of the
    canvas below "Biotech" is largely empty, and some inner-ring labels (K8s GitOps,
    RAG Pipelines, LLM Agents) cluster tightly.'
