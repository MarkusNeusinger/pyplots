review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of horizontal orientation for long category labels, enhancing readability
  - Clever separation of positive and negative values into two series for proper color
    coding and legend clarity
  - Value formatter with +/- signs clearly indicates direction within each bar
  - Data sorted by value from highest to lowest enables easy pattern recognition
  - Custom style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Dual output format (PNG and HTML) leverages pygal SVG/interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes deviate from library template defaults though they work well for the
    canvas size
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart area to reduce empty space
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing customer
    satisfaction survey results across 10 departments. Bars extend left (coral/salmon
    color, -12 to -45) for dissatisfied and right (blue, +31 to +72) for satisfied
    scores. The chart uses a white background with clear category labels on the left
    Y-axis (Customer Support, Response Time, Website Experience, etc.), numerical
    value labels centered within each bar with +/- signs, and an X-axis showing Satisfaction
    Score ranging from -100 to +100. The title "Customer Satisfaction Survey · bar-diverging
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom shows "Satisfied"
    (blue) and "Dissatisfied" (coral). Data is sorted by value from highest (Customer
    Support +72) to lowest (Return Process -45).

        comment: Good use of pygal's HorizontalBar, custom Style, print_values, value_formatter
          with signed numbers, and dual output (PNG + HTML). However, could leverage
          more interactive features.
  verdict: APPROVED
