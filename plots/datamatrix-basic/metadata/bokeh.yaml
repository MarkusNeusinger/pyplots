quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements Data Matrix ECC 200 standard with proper finder and timing
    patterns
  - High contrast black/white visualization ideal for scanning
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate canvas utilization
  - Uses Bokeh-specific features well (ColumnDataSource, rect glyph, Title model)
  - Includes quiet zone as specified
  - Realistic example content (serial number use case)
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of flat KISS structure (encode_ascii, get_symbol_size,
    reed_solomon_encode, create_datamatrix)
  - The 3600x3600 square format is appropriate but uses custom sizing instead of library-recommended
    4800x2700
  image_description: The plot displays a Data Matrix 2D barcode on a white background
    with high contrast black modules. The title "datamatrix-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in large, readable font. The barcode matrix shows the characteristic
    L-shaped finder pattern with a solid black left column and solid black bottom
    row. The alternating timing pattern is visible on the top edge (starting with
    white) and right edge. The inner data region contains the encoded pattern for
    "SERIAL:12345678". A subtitle at the bottom displays the encoded content. The
    barcode is centered with an adequate quiet zone (white border) surrounding it.
    The overall layout is clean with good canvas utilization.
