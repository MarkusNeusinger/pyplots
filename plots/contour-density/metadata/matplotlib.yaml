review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of filled contours with contour lines for visual clarity
  - Appropriate scatter point overlay with semi-transparency showing individual points
  - Good colorbar implementation with proper labeling
  - Two-cluster data effectively demonstrates density pattern detection
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of KDE from scipy for density computation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Variable, Y Variable) - could use descriptive labels
    with units
  - Does not use matplotlib contour label feature (ax.clabel) which would add value
  - Scatter point size (s=30) is on the smaller side for overlay context
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density contour visualization with filled
    blue contours showing concentration levels of points. Two distinct clusters are
    visible: a larger, denser cluster centered around (4-5, 4.5-5.5) and a smaller,
    secondary cluster centered around (9-10, 8-9). The plot uses a "Blues" colormap
    ranging from light blue (low density ~0.000) to darker blue (high density ~0.048).
    Yellow/gold scatter points with dark blue edges are overlaid on the contours for
    context. The title reads "contour-density · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top,
    with "X Variable" on the x-axis and "Y Variable" on the y-axis. A colorbar labeled
    "Density" appears on the right side. The grid is subtle with dashed lines at alpha
    0.3.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib's contourf/contour/scatter correctly, but scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
          does the heavy lifting; could use matplotlib-specific features like clabel
          for contour labels
  verdict: APPROVED
