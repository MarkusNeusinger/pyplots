review:
  strengths:
  - Clear hierarchical layout with root at top and children below
  - Excellent color differentiation between organizational levels
  - Node sizes appropriately scaled by hierarchy level (CEO largest)
  - Well-constructed legend with level descriptions
  - HoverTool adds interactivity for role/level information
  - Clean edges without clutter connecting parent-child relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears on left side of plot rather than integrated within the main visualization
    area
  - Level 3 (Team Members) node labels are relatively small compared to the node density
    at that level
  image_description: The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart with 24
    nodes arranged across 4 levels. At the top (Level 0) is a single blue node labeled
    "CEO". Level 1 contains 3 yellow nodes for VPs (Engineering, Product, Operations).
    Level 2 has 6 light blue nodes for Directors/Managers (Frontend Dir., Backend
    Dir., PM Lead, UX Lead, IT Manager, HR Manager). Level 3 at the bottom has 14
    green nodes representing team members (developers, designers, HR specialists,
    IT support, recruiter). Gray edges connect parent-child relationships. A legend
    on the left side shows level colors with labels. The title "network-hierarchical
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.
