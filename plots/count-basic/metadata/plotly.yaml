review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-balanced layout and proportions
  - Correct implementation of count plot with automatic counting from raw data
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic survey response scenario that clearly demonstrates the plot type
  - Count labels positioned outside bars for easy reading
  weaknesses:
  - Could enhance Plotly interactivity with custom hover templates showing percentages
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Count (n) or Frequency)
  - Bar colors could use a gradient or vary by value to better showcase Plotly capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing survey response
    counts. Five blue bars (#306998 with darker outlines) are arranged from highest
    to lowest frequency: Agree (66), Strongly Agree (56), Neutral (36), Disagree (27),
    and Strongly Disagree (15). Each bar has its count value displayed above it in
    large text. The title "count-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The x-axis is labeled "Survey Response" and y-axis is labeled "Count". The background
    uses the plotly_white template with subtle horizontal gridlines. The layout is
    clean and well-proportioned.'
