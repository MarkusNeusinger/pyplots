review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent collision detection algorithm using Archimedean spiral placement
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color scheme using Python official colors (blue/yellow)
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Word cloud occupies only ~30-35% of the canvas area, leaving excessive whitespace
  - Could increase font size range or reduce spiral step to fill more space
  - Only 20 words when spec suggests 20-200 for readability
  - Smaller words like Deep and Big are difficult to read at the current scale
