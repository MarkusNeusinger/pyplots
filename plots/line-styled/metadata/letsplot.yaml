review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, longdash)
    as specified
  - Perfect title format following the {spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai convention
  - 'Strong accessibility: combining color AND line style ensures print/colorblind
    friendliness'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic climate zone temperature data that makes intuitive sense
  - Well-sized text elements (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt ticks) appropriate for
    4800×2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in code specifies color=Climate Zone and linetype=Climate Zone but the
    data column is Station - while it works, the column naming is inconsistent
  - All four climate zones follow the same basic seasonal pattern (low in winter,
    high in summer) - could show more variation (e.g., Southern Hemisphere climate
    with inverse pattern)
