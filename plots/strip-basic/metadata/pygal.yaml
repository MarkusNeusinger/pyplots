review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of strip plot using pygal XY chart with manual jitter
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good transparency handling for overlapping points
  - Realistic survey score scenario with varied distributions per department
  - Proper title format and well-balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme uses only 2 distinct colors (blue/yellow) for 4 categories, making
    Engineering/Sales and Marketing/Support visually indistinguishable without legend
  - Axis labels lack units (could be Survey Score 1-10 for clarity)
