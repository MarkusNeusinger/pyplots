review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and markers for the high-resolution
    output
  - Clear elbow point annotation with both highlighted marker and vertical reference
    line
  - Realistic K-means inertia data that demonstrates the classic elbow pattern effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines exactly
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource as recommended in Bokeh guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned in the far top-right corner, isolated from the plot area
    with significant empty space
  - Does not utilize Bokeh-specific interactive features like HoverTool to show exact
    values on hover
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering with
    a light gray background (#fafafa). The title "elbow-curve · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears centered at the top in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled "Number of
    Clusters (k)" ranging from 1 to 10, and the Y-axis is labeled "Inertia (Within-Cluster
    Sum of Squares)" ranging from approximately 0 to 5000. The curve shows blue (#306998)
    circular markers connected by a blue line, starting high at k=1 (~5000) and dropping
    sharply to k=4, then leveling off. The elbow point at k=4 is highlighted with
    a larger yellow (#FFD43B) marker. A dashed yellow vertical line marks the elbow
    position. An "Elbow Point" text annotation appears near k=4. The legend in the
    top-right corner shows "Optimal k = 4" with a yellow marker. Grid lines are subtle
    and dashed.

          Bokeh strengths like HoverTool for interactivity, which would be natural
          for this library
