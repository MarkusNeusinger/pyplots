review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of bump chart with inverted Y-axis (rank 1 at top)
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 6 distinct colors
  - 'Data demonstrates all bump chart patterns: overtakes, stability, rise, and fall'
  - Perfect title format and clear subtitle context
  - Well-sized markers and line widths for visibility
  - Clean legend placement on the right side
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title Match Week not visible in the rendered image despite being configured
  - LineSeries imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area instead of highcharts_core.options.series.line
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing league standings for
    6 sports teams (Eagles, Wolves, Tigers, Bears, Sharks, Lions) over 6 match weeks.
    The Y-axis is correctly inverted with Rank 1 at the top and Rank 6 at the bottom.
    Each team is represented by a colored line with circular markers at each week:
    Eagles (blue), Wolves (yellow), Tigers (purple), Bears (cyan), Sharks (pink),
    Lions (brown). The title "bump-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently
    at the top with a subtitle "League Standings Over Season". The legend is positioned
    vertically on the right side. Lines show various patterns - Eagles rise to 1st,
    Wolves start strong then fade, Tigers peak mid-season, Bears drop early and stabilize,
    while Sharks and Lions remain consistently at 5th and 6th place respectively.'
