review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette using Python blue/yellow and complementary
    colors
  - Creative approach to show toggle UI in static image
  - HTML output includes actual interactive toggle functionality
  - Well-structured hierarchical data with realistic company budget scenario
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Treemap view is completely empty/blank - the pygal.Treemap render_to_png()
    produces no visible content'
  - Sunburst (donut) chart labels are too small and some get truncated at edges
  - Left half of the image is wasted space due to missing treemap
  - The donut chart only shows top-level departments, not the hierarchical sub-departments
    that would make it a true sunburst
  - Legends are isolated far from their respective charts
  image_description: 'The image displays a side-by-side layout at 4800×2700 pixels
    with a main title "hierarchy-toggle-view · pygal · pyplots.ai" in Python blue
    (#306998) at the top, followed by a gray subtitle "Technology Company Budget Allocation".
    Below is a toggle UI element with "Treemap" (selected/highlighted in blue) and
    "Sunburst" buttons. The left side labeled "Treemap View" is completely empty/blank
    - no treemap visualization is rendered. The right side shows a "Sunburst View"
    which is actually a donut chart (pie with inner radius) displaying 4 segments:
    Engineering (blue, ~155M), Sales (yellow, ~115M), Operations (green, ~80M), and
    HR (orange, ~65M). Text labels appear inside/near the donut segments showing department
    names and values but are quite small and some are truncated. Both legends at the
    bottom show the 4 department categories with color squares.'
