review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative faceting to create vertically stacked subplots
    with independent y-scales
  - Clean professional color scheme with distinct colorblind-accessible colors for
    each component
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for authentic decomposition
  - Component labels prominently displayed using facet headers with good font styling
  - Appropriate data coverage with 96 monthly points over 8 years for meaningful decomposition
  - Code follows KISS principles with clear linear flow
  weaknesses:
  - Missing light grid lines that specification explicitly requests
  - Y-axis labels all say generic Value rather than being component-specific
  - Could leverage Altair interactivity features like .interactive() or tooltips
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series decomposition visualization
    with four vertically stacked line charts sharing a common x-axis (Date, spanning
    2018-2025). Each subplot shows a distinct component: **Original** (blue line)
    shows the raw time series data with visible trend and seasonal fluctuations ranging
    from ~75 to ~200; **Trend** (red line) displays a smooth upward linear trend from
    ~100 to ~170; **Seasonal** (teal line) shows a perfect repeating annual sinusoidal
    pattern oscillating between approximately -30 and +30; **Residual** (purple line)
    shows random noise fluctuating around 0 within a range of roughly -20 to +20.
    The title "timeseries-decomposition · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    Component names are displayed as bold labels on the left side of each subplot.
    Font sizes appear adequate for readability.'

        comment: Good use of faceting with `row=` encoding, declarative color mapping,
          and independent y-scales via `resolve_scale`. Could have added interactivity
          with `.interactive()` or tooltips.
  verdict: APPROVED
