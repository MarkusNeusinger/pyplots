review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required ROC curve features (diagonal reference,
    AUC in legend, multiple model comparison)
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate font sizing for the large canvas
  - Well-structured KISS code with proper reproducibility (seed 42)
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for branding consistency
  - Dashed reference line provides clear visual distinction from model curves
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner outside plot creates slight visual imbalance
  - ROC curves for two models only; adding a third classifier would demonstrate more
    variation
  - Model A AUC of 0.98 is unrealistically high for most real-world scenarios
  image_description: 'The plot displays an ROC curve visualization on a white background
    with a clean layout. Three series are shown: Model A (blue line, AUC = 0.98) which
    rises steeply near FPR=0 and plateaus near TPR=1.0, Model B (yellow line, AUC
    = 0.72) which shows a more gradual curve, and a gray diagonal reference line for
    Random classification (AUC = 0.50). The title "roc-curve · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The X-axis is labeled "False Positive Rate" (0 to 1)
    and Y-axis is labeled "True Positive Rate" (0 to 1). The legend is positioned
    in the top-left corner outside the plot area. Grid lines are subtle and aid readability.'

        comment: Title, axis labels, and legend text are all readable. Font sizes
          are well-scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas.

        comment: Line widths are appropriate; all three curves are clearly distinguishable.

        max: 5
        passed: true
        comment: Blue, yellow, and gray provide good contrast. Blue/yellow distinction
          works for most colorblind types but not ideal for tritanopia.

        comment: Plot fills canvas well with balanced margins; legend placement is
          sensible.

        score: 1
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: Labels are descriptive ("False Positive Rate", "True Positive Rate")
          but lack units (though unitless 0-1 is standard for ROC).

        name: Grid & Legend
        score: 1
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: Grid is subtle and helpful; legend is functional but placed outside
          plot area which creates some empty space in top-left.

          Could benefit from a third model to show more variation.

        comment: AUC values (0.98 and 0.72) are realistic. Model A at 0.98 is perhaps
          slightly too perfect.

        comment: Uses pygal XY chart with custom Style, dashed line for reference.
          Could leverage more pygal-specific features like tooltips or better interactivity
          in the HTML output.
  verdict: APPROVED
