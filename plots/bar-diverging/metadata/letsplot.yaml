review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the diverging bar chart concept with clear visual
    separation of positive/negative values
  - Perfect title format and spec compliance with all required features (contrasting
    colors, horizontal orientation, zero baseline, sorted bars)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with appropriate lets-plot grammar
    of graphics syntax
  - Good color choice with red/blue that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical to preserve sort order
  weaknesses:
  - Could add interactive tooltips to leverage lets-plot interactive capabilities
    in the HTML output
  - Data distribution slightly unbalanced (only 4 negative vs 8 positive categories)
