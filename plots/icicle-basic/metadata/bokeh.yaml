review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart conditional labeling that hides text for small rectangles and includes values
    for larger ones
  - Beautiful color gradient by hierarchy level (Python Blue theme)
  - Level labels on the left margin provide clear context for each row
  - Proportional sizing accurately represents values across the hierarchy
  - Clean white borders and light background enhance readability
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (calc_value, assign_level, layout_icicle) instead of
    KISS linear script style
  - Could leverage Bokeh HoverTool for interactive tooltips showing node details
