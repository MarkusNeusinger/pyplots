review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native clustering feature with pie-chart style category
    breakdown
  - Clean, professional appearance with light basemap providing good context
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic retail store locator scenario with appropriate data volume (440 points)
  - Good color palette with four distinguishable categories
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes (440 stores) which deviates slightly from the standard spec-id
    · library · pyplots.ai format
  - Cluster markers show category composition well, but the pie chart visualization
    is dominated by Hardware (yellow) in most clusters
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered marker map of North America showing
    440 retail store locations. The basemap uses the "carto-positron" light gray style,
    providing good geographic context including state/country boundaries and labels
    for "UNITED STATES", "MEXICO", "CUBA", "DOMINICAN REPUBLIC", and "JAMAICA". Cluster
    markers are displayed as pie-chart style circles showing the category composition,
    with counts displayed in the center (e.g., 36, 17, 13, 11, 10, 9, 7, 4). The cluster
    markers use a visually appealing multi-color scheme representing four store categories:
    blue (Electronics), green (Grocery), red/orange (Clothing), and yellow (Hardware).
    A legend in the upper-left corner clearly identifies the "Store Category" with
    all four categories and their corresponding colors. The title at the top reads
    "Retail Store Locations (440 stores) · map-marker-clustered · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    in a large, readable font. The map is centered on the continental US with zoom
    level showing clusters for major city regions (Seattle area=9, Denver area=7,
    Phoenix/LA=13+4, Houston=10, Atlanta=9, Miami=11, Chicago=17, New York/Boston=36).'
