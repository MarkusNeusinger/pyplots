review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of step function behavior with clear horizontal
    and vertical transitions
  - Thoughtful addition of markers at data points and fill under the curve enhances
    visual understanding
  - Realistic server capacity scenario that demonstrates practical application of
    step plots
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with appropriate font sizes
    for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper right overlaps with peak data region; upper left would
    be better
  - Could utilize more advanced matplotlib features (annotations at key transitions,
    twin axes for additional metrics)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a step line chart showing server capacity
    over a 24-hour period. The chart uses a blue step line (#306998) with yellow/gold
    circular markers (#FFD43B) at each data point. There is a light blue semi-transparent
    fill beneath the step curve. The x-axis shows "Hour of Day" with labels from 00:00
    to 22:00 in 2-hour increments. The y-axis shows "Server Capacity (units)" ranging
    from 0 to 160+. The title follows the correct format: "line-stepwise · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper right indicates "Server Capacity". The plot
    clearly shows the characteristic horizontal-then-vertical step transitions, with
    capacity at 50 during night hours, ramping up through morning to peak at 150 around
    midday, then declining back to 50 by evening. Dashed grid lines at alpha 0.3 provide
    reference without being distracting.'
