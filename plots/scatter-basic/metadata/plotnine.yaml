review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing following library guidelines
    (title=24, axis_title=20, axis_text=16)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper ggplot2-style grammar
    of graphics
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) that is immediately
    understandable
  - Proper use of alpha=0.7 for point transparency as recommended in spec
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not utilize color or size aesthetics to demonstrate additional plotnine capabilities
  - Grid configuration uses element_line with alpha parameter which may not fully
    render as expected in all plotnine versions
