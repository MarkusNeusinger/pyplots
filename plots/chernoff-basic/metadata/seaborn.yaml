review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent feature mapping of Iris variables to facial characteristics with clear
    documentation
  - Good colorblind-safe palette choice (Set2)
  - Clear visual differentiation between species groups
  - Appropriate use of grid layout for comparing multiple faces
  - Correct title format and helpful legend
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: No seaborn plotting functions used - only styling (set_style, set_context,
    color_palette). The faces are drawn entirely with matplotlib patches.'
  - Layout balance is poor with excessive whitespace and small faces relative to canvas
    size
  - Uses function definition violating KISS structure requirement (no functions/classes)
  - Grid background (whitegrid) is unnecessary and distracting for this plot type
