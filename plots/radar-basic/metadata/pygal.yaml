review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of employee performance comparison scenario matching specification
    applications
  - Correct title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Good transparency (0.25 opacity) allowing overlap visibility as per spec requirements
  - Proper canvas dimensions (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled font sizes
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes deviate from library guidelines (uses 48/32 instead of suggested 28/18)
  - Legend placement in upper-left corner creates visual imbalance
  - Axis label rotation for some categories reduces readability compared to horizontal
    text
  image_description: 'The radar chart displays a hexagonal spider plot with 6 axes
    representing employee competencies: Communication (top), Technical Skills (upper-left),
    Teamwork (lower-left), Problem Solving (bottom), Leadership (lower-right), and
    Creativity (upper-right). Two filled polygons are rendered with transparency -
    blue (#306998) for Employee A and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for Employee B. The blue
    polygon shows higher values for Technical Skills (~92) and Communication (~85),
    while the yellow polygon shows strength in Leadership (~85) and Teamwork (~90).
    Gridlines are visible at intervals of 20 (0, 20, 40, 60, 80). The title "radar-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend in the upper-left corner
    identifies both employees. The polygons use ~25% opacity allowing overlap areas
    to be visible.'

        comment: Uses pygal's Radar chart, Style customization, fill mode, and dual
          PNG/HTML output, but could leverage more pygal-specific features like tooltips
          or custom formatting
  verdict: APPROVED
