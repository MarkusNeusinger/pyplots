quality_score: 90
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the confidence interval band using polygon fill technique
  - Clean, professional appearance with good color scheme (blue points, salmon CI
    band, green regression line)
  - R² value prominently displayed in the legend with the full regression equation
  - Appropriate data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that effectively demonstrates
    linear regression
  - Good use of pygal's custom Style for font sizing at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Study Hours (hrs)" and "Exam Score (points)")
  - Regression line could be more visually prominent against the CI band
  - The regression equation could be placed as a separate annotation rather than in
    the legend for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with 80 blue data points showing
    the relationship between Study Hours (x-axis, range 1-10) and Exam Score (y-axis,
    range ~37-110). A green/olive linear regression line runs through the data with
    a semi-transparent salmon/red 95% confidence interval band surrounding it. The
    legend in the top-left corner shows three entries: "Data Points" (blue), "95%
    CI Band" (red), and "Regression: y = 5.40x + 42.8 (R² = 0.791)" (green). The title
    "scatter-regression-linear · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot
    has a clean white background with subtle grid lines.'
