review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear contrast between scatter points, regression
    line, and confidence band
  - Complete implementation of all spec requirements including R² display, regression
    equation, and 95% CI
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) with appropriate data
    scales
  - Clean, readable KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Proper font sizing for 4800×2700px output (title 24pt, labels 20pt, ticks 16pt)
  - Good use of alpha transparency for both points (0.7) and CI band (0.25)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Study Hours (hrs)" and "Exam Score (points)")
  - Manual regression calculation rather than using scipy or numpy polyfit - works
    correctly but not leveraging library ecosystem
  image_description: 'The plot shows a scatter plot with linear regression on a white
    background. Blue circular markers (with white edge) represent 80 data points showing
    the relationship between Study Hours (x-axis, range 1-10) and Exam Score (y-axis,
    range ~30-100). A prominent red regression line runs diagonally from bottom-left
    to top-right with a semi-transparent yellow/gold 95% confidence interval band
    surrounding it. The title reads "scatter-regression-linear · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. An annotation box in the upper-left corner displays the regression
    equation "y = 6.32x + 33.12" and "R² = 0.848". A legend in the lower-right shows
    "95% CI" and "Regression Line". Axis labels are clear: "Study Hours" (x) and "Exam
    Score" (y). The grid is subtle with dashed lines.'
