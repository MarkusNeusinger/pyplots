review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with the 95% crossing point annotation, threshold
    lines, and subtle shading below 90%
  - Real Wine dataset provides genuine, reproducible PCA results that perfectly demonstrate
    the cumulative variance pattern
  - 'Professional visual polish: custom marker styling (white fill, blue edge), curved
    annotation arrows, and cohesive color scheme'
  - All spec requirements implemented including the optional bar overlay for individual
    variance
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - The seaborn-specific features could be leveraged more deeply — much of the visual
    polish is pure matplotlib
  - The bar plot x-axis uses categorical positions while the line plot uses numeric
    positions, which could cause misalignment issues in edge cases
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance chart for
    PCA component selection using the Wine dataset (13 features). Light blue semi-transparent
    bars show individual variance per component (decreasing from ~36% for PC1 to near
    0% for PC13). A blue line with white-filled, blue-edged circular markers traces
    the cumulative variance from ~36% up to ~100%. Two horizontal dashed threshold
    lines are drawn: an orange dashed line at 95% and a green dashed line at 90%,
    each labeled on the left side. A large orange dot highlights the 95% crossing
    point at component 10, connected by a curved arrow to a boxed annotation reading
    "10 components explain 96.2%". A very subtle green shading fills the region below
    90%. The title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative · seaborn · pyplots.ai". X-axis:
    "Number of Principal Components" (1-13). Y-axis: "Explained Variance (%)" (0-100).
    Legend in lower right shows "Individual Variance" (bar) and "Cumulative Variance"
    (line).'
