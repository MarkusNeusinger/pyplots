review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Highcharts parallel-coordinates module with proper axis configuration
  - Clear species separation visible in the visualization, demonstrating the power
    of parallel coordinates
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Proper transparency (0.7 alpha) for handling overlapping lines
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labels with units
  - Clean legend handling with showInLegend flag to avoid duplicate entries
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick label font size could be slightly larger for better readability at
    a glance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization of the
    Iris dataset with 4 vertical axes: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal
    Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). Three species are color-coded: Setosa (blue),
    Versicolor (yellow/gold), and Virginica (purple). Each species has 10 polylines
    connecting values across the axes. The Setosa lines cluster at the bottom of the
    Petal Length and Petal Width axes, clearly separating from the other species.
    The title "Iris Dataset · parallel-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. A horizontal legend at the bottom identifies the three species. The layout
    is clean with good margins and readable text.'
