review:
  strengths:
  - Clean spiral placement algorithm with no overlapping words
  - Effective use of pyplots brand colors (blue/yellow palette)
  - Good tech buzzwords dataset that is realistic and relatable
  - Correct title format and professional presentation
  - Creative workaround using pygal as SVG generator since it lacks native word cloud
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - word cloud occupies only ~40-45% of the
    vertical space
  - Smaller words (Terraform, GraphQL) are quite small relative to the canvas size
  - Pygal is used mainly as an SVG canvas rather than for its charting features
