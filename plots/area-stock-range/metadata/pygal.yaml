review:
  strengths:
  - Well-rendered area chart with appropriate semi-transparent fill (opacity 0.4)
  - Realistic stock price data using random walk simulation
  - Proper date formatting on x-axis with rotation to prevent overlap
  - Custom style configuration adapted for large canvas size (4800x2700)
  - HTML implementation includes range selector buttons and mini chart
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - The range selector (core spec feature) is not visible in the PNG output - only
    the HTML shows the interactive elements
  - X-axis date labels show some crowding despite sparse labeling
  - Legend placement in bottom left corner is awkward and small relative to the chart
  - Range selector in HTML only provides visual feedback - does not actually filter/zoom
    the main chart data
  - The mini chart does not provide smooth zoom transitions as specified
  image_description: The plot shows a filled area chart displaying stock price data
    over approximately 2 years (January 2024 to November 2025). The price starts around
    $150, dips to approximately $120 in early 2024, then gradually rises through 2024.
    There is a significant run-up in mid-2025 peaking at approximately $235 before
    pulling back to around $200. The area below the price line is filled with a semi-transparent
    blue color (#306998). The title "area-stock-range · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top. The x-axis shows date labels (e.g., "Jan 2024", "Feb 2024",
    "Mar 2024") with 45-degree rotation, and the y-axis shows "Price (USD)" with values
    ranging from approximately 120 to 235. A legend showing "Stock Price" appears
    at the bottom left corner. Horizontal grid lines are visible at the y-axis tick
    marks. Critically, there is NO range selector visible in the PNG output - the
    interactive range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) and mini chart that
    are the core distinguishing feature of this specification are only present in
    the HTML output, not the static PNG.
