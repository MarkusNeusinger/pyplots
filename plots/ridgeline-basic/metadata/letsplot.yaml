review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot's native geom_area_ridges for true ridgeline visualization
  - Clean, publication-quality appearance with well-chosen Spectral color palette
  - Thoughtful data generation with realistic Northern hemisphere temperature patterns
    (varying means and stds)
  - Proper month ordering (reversed for bottom-to-top display) with correct categorical
    handling
  - Good overlap parameter (scale=1.2) creating visual cohesion without obscuring
    distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical grid lines could be made subtler or removed for a cleaner ridgeline aesthetic
  - Color palette (Spectral) is not fully colorblind-accessible; viridis or a sequential
    palette could improve accessibility
