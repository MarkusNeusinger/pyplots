review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas - all text is highly readable
  - Smart date formatting with automatic month labels and rotation prevents overlap
  - Realistic stock price simulation with trend, seasonality, and noise components
  - Uses Bokeh-specific ColumnDataSource pattern correctly
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Clean, well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of grid styling with dashed lines and appropriate alpha
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text size (28pt) appears small relative to other text elements on the canvas
  - HoverTool adds code complexity but provides no benefit in the static PNG output
