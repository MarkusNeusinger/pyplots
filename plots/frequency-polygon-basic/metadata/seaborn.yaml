review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of frequency polygon with all spec requirements met (closed
    polygons, aligned bins, distinct markers, semi-transparent fill)
  - Outstanding data design showing unimodal vs bimodal distributions for meaningful
    comparison
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with distinct marker shapes for accessibility
  - Proper use of seaborn styling (whitegrid) integrated with matplotlib functionality
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between rather than exploring seaborn-native alternatives
    like kdeplot with fill parameter
  - Data scenario, while realistic, is somewhat generic (could have more specific
    variable naming)
  image_description: "The plot displays a frequency polygon comparing three experimental\
    \ conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) for response time distributions.\
    \ The x-axis shows \"Response Time (ms)\" ranging from approximately 200 to 625ms,\
    \ and the y-axis shows \"Frequency\" from 0 to 30. Three distinct line-filled\
    \ polygons are shown:\n\n- Control (blue #306998): A unimodal distribution centered\
    \ around 450ms with circle markers\n- Treatment A (yellow #FFD43B): A unimodal\
    \ distribution centered around 380ms with square markers  \n- Treatment B (teal\
    \ #2AA198): A bimodal distribution with peaks around 350ms and 500ms with triangle\
    \ markers\n\nEach group has distinct colors, different marker shapes, and semi-transparent\
    \ fills (alpha=0.15) beneath the lines. The legend is positioned in the upper\
    \ right corner with a semi-transparent background (framealpha=0.9). A subtle dashed\
    \ grid (alpha=0.3) is visible in the background. All lines extend to zero at both\
    \ ends, forming properly closed polygons as specified. The title follows the required\
    \ format \"frequency-polygon-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai\" at 24pt font size."

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with seaborn styling via set_style(whitegrid),
          but frequency polygon is not a native seaborn plot type - implementation
          uses matplotlib fill_between rather than seaborn-specific features
