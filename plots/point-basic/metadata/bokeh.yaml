review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizontal point estimate plot with proper orientation
    for readability
  - Proper use of Bokeh's Whisker annotation with TeeHead caps for error bars
  - Clean reference line at zero using Span model
  - Appropriate font sizing for the large canvas (36pt title, 28pt labels, 22pt ticks)
  - Good visual hierarchy with yellow-filled points outlined in blue
  - Realistic treatment effect data with varying confidence interval widths
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show exact values on mouse-over (Bokeh's key interactive
    feature)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Effect Size (Cohen's d)" would be more informative)
