review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Kaplan-Meier step functions using ax.step with correct
    post interpolation
  - 'Complete spec compliance: CI bands, censored tick marks, median annotations,
    group comparison all included'
  - Clean, well-commented code following KISS principles with proper Greenwald variance
    calculation
  - Good color choices (blue/yellow) that are colorblind-accessible and high contrast
  - Proper handling of censored observations with interpolated survival values for
    tick mark placement
  weaknesses:
  - Missing at-risk table below the plot which was suggested in spec Notes
  - The confidence interval bands could be slightly more transparent to better show
    curve overlap regions
  - Median text box positioning could be adjusted to avoid any potential overlap with
    axis labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis comparing
    two groups: Treatment Group (blue, #306998) and Control Group (yellow/gold, #FFD43B).
    Both curves are step functions starting at survival probability 1.0 and decreasing
    over time (0-60 months). The Treatment Group shows better survival with a median
    of 21.9 months vs Control Group median of 16.6 months. Each curve has a semi-transparent
    95% confidence interval band. Vertical tick marks along the curves indicate censored
    observations. Dotted vertical lines mark the median survival times, with a horizontal
    dotted line at 0.5 probability. A text box in the bottom-right corner displays
    the median values. The legend is positioned in the upper-right corner. Grid is
    subtle with alpha=0.3 and dashed lines.'

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3), but legend is in upper right which could
          potentially overlap with data in some scenarios; also median text box partially
          overlaps with y-axis area

        comment: Good use of ax.step with where="post", fill_between with step="post",
          scatter for tick marks, but no advanced matplotlib features like spines
          customization or twin axes for at-risk table
  verdict: APPROVED
