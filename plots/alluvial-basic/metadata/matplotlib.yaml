review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram from scratch using matplotlib low-level
    Path and patches API
  - Clean bezier curves for flow bands with appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4) for
    overlapping flows
  - Consistent color scheme across all time points for easy category tracking
  - Realistic voter migration data with believable patterns
  - Well-structured flow matrix data that accurately represents transitions between
    categories
  weaknesses:
  - Legend uses Independent but nodes use Indep abbreviation - should be consistent
  - Node labels could be slightly larger for the smallest nodes
