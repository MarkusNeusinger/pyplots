review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the motion blur ghost effect with layered semi-transparent
    bars
  - Clear visual hierarchy with threshold colors and trend indicators (arrows)
  - LIVE indicator effectively communicates real-time nature for static output
  - Clean color scheme with semantic meaning (red=critical, orange=warning, green=normal)
  - Well-balanced layout with good use of annotations
  weaknesses:
  - Legend font size (14pt) is slightly smaller relative to other text elements
  - Could benefit from more distinctive matplotlib features like custom patches or
    gradients
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitoring dashboard
    for 6 servers (A through F). The main bars show current CPU percentages with color
    coding: red (#E74C3C) for critical (>80%), orange/yellow (#F39C12) for warning
    (60-80%), and green (#27AE60) for normal (<60%). Server B (92%) and Server D (88%)
    are in red, Server A (78%), Server E (63%), and Server F (71%) are in orange,
    and Server C (45%) is in green. Behind each current bar are two ghosted/faded
    bars (light gray and medium gray) representing previous values to create a motion
    blur effect suggesting dynamic updates. Triangle arrows above bars indicate trend
    direction: upward red triangles for increasing values, downward green triangles
    for decreasing. Two horizontal dashed threshold lines are shown at 60% (orange,
    Warning) and 80% (red, Critical). A "● LIVE" indicator with red text and white
    rounded box appears in the top-left corner. The legend in the upper-right identifies
    the threshold lines. All text is clearly legible with appropriate font sizes.'
