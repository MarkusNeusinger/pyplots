review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe palette with excellent visual distinction between communities
    (blue, yellow, teal, purple)
  - Node degree-based sizing effectively shows connection importance
  - Correct title format following pyplots convention
  - Clean data structure with realistic social network scenario
  - Proper use of Highcharts networkgraph module with force-directed layout algorithm
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned too far from the network with excessive whitespace on the
    right side
  - No random seed/fixed layout initialization means layout may vary between runs
  - Some minor node overlap in dense areas could be improved with layout tuning
