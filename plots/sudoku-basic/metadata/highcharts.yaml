review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Sudoku grid visual hierarchy with thick 3×3 box
    boundaries and thin cell lines
  - Clean monochrome design perfectly suited for printing as specified
  - Numbers are well-centered and highly legible at 72px font size
  - Creative use of HTML overlay for drawing grid lines alongside Highcharts scatter
    series
  - Title format matches specification exactly
  - Uses a real, recognizable Sudoku puzzle pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Small artifact visible at bottom edge of image (appears as a thin colored line)
  - 'The thin cell grid lines (gray #999999) could be slightly darker for better visibility
    when printed'
  - Grid lines are rendered via HTML divs rather than native Highcharts features,
    which is less elegant
