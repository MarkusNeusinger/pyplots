review:
  strengths:
  - Clean squarify algorithm implementation creates well-proportioned rectangles
  - Excellent color palette choice - visually appealing and colorblind-safe
  - Smart label sizing logic that adapts to rectangle dimensions
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - White borders clearly delineate rectangle boundaries
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Spec mentions subcategory hierarchy but implementation only shows single-level
    categories
  - Legend positioned far right creates visual imbalance with treemap on left side
  - Could leverage more lets-plot specific features for enhanced visualization
