review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pd.Categorical to enforce sort order in plotnine
  - Value labels above bars improve readability
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar of graphics implementation
  - Good font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Appropriate rotation of x-axis labels to prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Could highlight top category with different color as spec suggests
  - No random seed comment (data is deterministic but convention not followed)
