review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinates with proper Cartesian transformation
  - Real-world soil composition context with sand/silt/clay is pedagogically valuable
  - Clean grid system with consistent 20% intervals on all three axes
  - Proper marker sizing and transparency for 50 data points
  - Well-formatted title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Data points cluster toward the center; consider adjusting Dirichlet alpha parameters
    to show more edge/corner cases
  - Layout uses 16:9 aspect ratio but triangle is inherently more square, causing
    some wasted horizontal space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary diagram in the form of an equilateral
    triangle. The title "Soil Composition · ternary-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The three vertices are labeled with bold text: "Sand (%)"
    at the top, "Silt (%)" at the bottom-left, and "Clay (%)" at the bottom-right.
    The triangle has a solid black outline with dashed gray grid lines at 20% intervals.
    Tick labels (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) run along each edge. Approximately 50 blue
    data points with white edges are scattered throughout the triangle interior, representing
    soil composition samples. The blue color is a pleasant #306998 with alpha transparency.'
