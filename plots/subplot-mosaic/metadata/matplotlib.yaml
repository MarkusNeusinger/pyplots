review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of plt.subplot_mosaic() with the AAB;AAB;CDE pattern -
    this is exactly what the spec asked for
  - Great variety of plot types (line with fill_between, horizontal bar, scatter,
    histogram, text metrics)
  - Clean, professional color scheme with accessible blue/yellow palette
  - Well-structured dashboard layout with clear visual hierarchy (large overview,
    medium bar chart, small detail panels)
  - Realistic sales dashboard scenario with appropriate data scales
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter plot markers could be larger (s=100 is adequate but s=150 would be more
    visible for 80 points)
  - Missing demonstration of empty cells with . placeholder mentioned in spec notes
  - Metrics panel (E) layout could be tighter - the box has significant internal whitespace
