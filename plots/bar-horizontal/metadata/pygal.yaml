review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visual design with consistent steel blue color
  - Data sorted by value (highest to lowest) for easy comparison as recommended in
    spec
  - Excellent use of pygal print_values feature to display percentages on bars
  - Realistic programming language survey data that is immediately relatable
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas sizing with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels not shown directly on y-axis; users must cross-reference the legend
    at bottom to identify each bar
  - Legend placement at bottom separates labels from their corresponding bars, reducing
    readability
  - Value labels on bars (18.6%, 16.3%, 12.9%) are positioned inside bars making them
    harder to read against the blue background
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing programming
    language popularity survey results. There are 10 horizontal bars in a consistent
    steel blue color (#306998), sorted from highest (Python at 68.7%) to lowest (Swift
    at 12.9%). The title "bar-horizontal · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in dark text. The x-axis shows "Popularity (%)" with tick marks from 0.0% to 60.0%.
    Each bar has its percentage value displayed at the end. A legend at the bottom
    shows all 10 programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, TypeScript,
    C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Swift) arranged in two rows of 5 columns. The background is
    white with subtle vertical grid lines. The bars have good spacing and the overall
    layout is clean and professional.
