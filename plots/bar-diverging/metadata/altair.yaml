review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of diverging bar chart following all spec requirements
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types and sorting
  - Good color choice with Python blue/yellow that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper zero baseline rule layered on top of bars
  - Interactive tooltips and HTML export leverage Altair web-native capabilities
  - Well-sized text elements for readability at target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom-right creates slight visual imbalance; could be positioned
    closer to the chart or at top
  - Realistic context score slightly reduced - while customer satisfaction is valid,
    the exact score values feel somewhat arbitrary
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing "Net
    Satisfaction Score" for 12 company departments. Bars extend from a central zero
    baseline - positive values (blue/Python blue #306998) extend to the right, negative
    values (yellow/Python yellow #FFD43B) extend to the left. The chart is sorted
    by satisfaction score from lowest (Logistics at -45) at the top to highest (Customer
    Service at +42) at the bottom. A dark vertical line marks the zero baseline. The
    x-axis ranges from -60 to 60 with label "Net Satisfaction Score". Department names
    appear on the y-axis. A legend in the bottom-right corner shows "Sentiment" with
    Positive and Negative indicators. The title "bar-diverging · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears centered at the top. Grid lines are subtle with dashed styling.'
