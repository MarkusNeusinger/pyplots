review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Clean declarative layer composition using Altair's grammar of graphics
  - Realistic, neutral dataset with recognizable tech companies and accurate financials
  - Smart label positioning with consistent dx/dy offsets to avoid point overlap
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity in HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Missing connector lines/arrows from labels to points as mentioned in specification
    notes
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like conditional formatting or selections
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 10 tech company data points
    showing Revenue (Billions USD) on the x-axis (ranging from 0-640) and Profit Margin
    (%) on the y-axis (ranging from 0-60). Each point is rendered as a blue circle
    (#306998) with moderate opacity. Company names are displayed as bold dark text
    labels positioned to the upper-right of each point. Companies shown include NVIDIA
    (high profit margin ~55%, low revenue ~61B), Apple (high revenue ~385B, moderate
    margin ~25%), Microsoft, Amazon (highest revenue ~574B, lowest margin ~6%), Google,
    Meta, Adobe, Oracle, Tesla, and Intel. The title "scatter-annotated · altair ·
    pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. Grid lines are subtle with low opacity.
    The overall layout is clean and balanced.

        comment: Uses Altair's layered grammar (points + labels), tooltip encoding,
          and declarative style. However, could leverage more Altair-specific features
          like interactive selections, conditional encodings, or text adjustments
  verdict: APPROVED
