review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Kagi chart algorithm implementation with proper yang/yin logic
  - Clear visual distinction between thick green (bullish) and thin red (bearish)
    lines
  - Proper horizontal shoulders and waists at reversal points
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  - Appropriate use of lets-plot grammar of graphics
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain what green/red and thick/thin lines represent
  - Grid styling could be more subtle
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart showing price movements over approximately
    14 line indices. Green (thick) lines represent yang/bullish segments and red (thin)
    lines represent yin/bearish segments. The chart starts at around $101, rises to
    a peak of ~$110, then shows multiple trend reversals oscillating between roughly
    $82-$110. Horizontal segments connect vertical price movements at reversal points
    (shoulders and waists). The title reads "kagi-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" at
    the top. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from 84-110, and the X-axis shows
    "Line Index" from 0-13. The background is white with a subtle grid, and the minimal
    theme provides clean presentation.
