review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following plotnine grammar of graphics approach with geom_step
    + geom_point layering
  - Excellent color contrast between blue step line and yellow markers
  - Perfect title format and axis label sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that demonstrates step plot characteristics
    well
  - Minimal theme with subtle grid provides professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows decimal values (2.5, 5.0, 7.5) instead of integer months 1-12; should
    use scale_x_continuous with breaks=range(1,13)
  - Data could show more dramatic variation in step heights to better demonstrate
    the plot type ability to show sudden changes
