review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with appropriate font sizes for title (24pt), axis labels
    (20pt), and tick labels (16pt)
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation using proper aes mappings and geoms
  - Good color palette with Python blue (#306998) featured prominently
  - Appropriate use of categorical ordering for consistent legend/color mapping
  - Month labels displayed as readable abbreviations (Jan, Feb, etc.) instead of numbers
  - Realistic business data scenario with 4 distinct product trend patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are nearly invisible due to minimal theme - could benefit from explicit
    grid alpha setting
  - Data patterns could show more dramatic trend differences (e.g., line crossovers,
    seasonal spikes) to better demonstrate multi-line comparison capabilities
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a multi-line chart showing monthly sales data (Jan-Dec) for 4 product lines. The x-axis shows months with abbreviated labels, and the y-axis shows "Sales (thousands USD)" ranging from approximately 50-200. Four distinct lines are visible:
    - **Electronics** (blue #306998): Strong upward trend, starting ~110 and ending ~195
    - **Clothing** (yellow #FFD43B): Starts high ~130, trends downward to ~65
    - **Furniture** (green #81C784): Relatively flat around 90-110
    - **Accessories** (salmon/red #E57373): Starts ~115, trends downward to ~75

    Each line has circular markers at data points. The legend is positioned on the right side, clearly labeled "Product Line". The title reads "line-multi · plotnine · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gridlines.

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar (aes, geom_line, geom_point, scale_color_manual),
          but could leverage more plotnine-specific features like faceting or statistical
          transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
