review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with proper font hierarchy (24/20/16pt)
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Uses tick_labels parameter correctly (avoiding deprecated API)
  - Good customization of box elements (patch_artist, custom line widths, alpha transparency)
  - Realistic department performance context with varied distributions
  - Proper outlier display with styled flierprops
  - Subtle grid enhances readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Engineering (#306998) and Sales (#4B8BBE) colors are both blue shades - could
    use more distinct colors for better differentiation
  - Performance scores exceed 100 for some outliers which is slightly inconsistent
    if interpreting as percentage scores
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box-and-whisker chart with 4 departments
    (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support) on the x-axis and Performance Score on
    the y-axis (ranging from ~20 to ~130). Each department has a distinct colored
    box: Engineering in steel blue (#306998), Marketing in yellow (#FFD43B), Sales
    in lighter blue (#4B8BBE), and Support in orange (#E8A838). The boxes show median
    lines, quartile boxes, and whiskers extending to 1.5*IQR. Outliers are visible
    as gray circular points - Engineering has one low outlier (~43), Marketing has
    one high outlier (~104), and Sales has three outliers (one very high at ~127,
    one at ~104, and one very low at ~21). The title "box-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A subtle horizontal grid with dashed lines aids readability.'

        comment: Uses patch_artist for filled boxes and customizes flierprops/medianprops/whiskerprops,
          but does not use more advanced matplotlib features like violin overlays
          or swarm points
  verdict: APPROVED
