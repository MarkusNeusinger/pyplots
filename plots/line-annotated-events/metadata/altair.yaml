quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating y-positions for event labels to prevent overlap
  - Clean layered chart composition with separate charts for line, rules, markers,
    and labels
  - Good color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and contrasting yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility
  - Proper use of Altair encoding types (:T, :Q, :N)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend/key for event types as suggested in spec notes
  - Vertical rules use hardcoded y2=alt.value(900) which may not align with actual
    chart height
  - No tooltips on event markers for interactivity (missed opportunity for Altair's
    strength)
