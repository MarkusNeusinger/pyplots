review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native Scatterternary for ternary diagrams
  - Clean, well-proportioned layout with proper margins
  - Hover template provides useful interactive tooltips with formatted percentages
  - Font sizes perfectly scaled for 4800x2700 output
  - White marker outlines improve point visibility in overlapping areas
  - Realistic soil science context (sand/silt/clay classification)
  - Proper normalization ensures compositions sum to 100%
  weaknesses:
  - Data is purely random without meaningful patterns - could show soil type clusters
    (sandy, silty, clayey regions)
  - Library features underutilized - could add color encoding by a fourth variable
    or use marker size variation
  - Slight marker overlap in dense central regions of the triangle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary diagram showing soil composition
    data with three components: Sand (%), Silt (%), and Clay (%). The equilateral
    triangle has the title "ternary-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top
    in large, readable font. Blue markers (#306998) with white outlines and 0.7 opacity
    are distributed across the triangle, representing 50 soil samples. Each vertex
    is labeled with its component name and percentage units. Grid lines appear at
    20% intervals with subtle gray color (0.2 opacity). The tick labels show values
    from 0-100 at 20% increments. The white background provides clean contrast, and
    markers are well-sized for the data density.'
