review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of LOWESS algorithm from scratch with proper tricube
    weighting
  - Clear visual distinction between scatter points (blue, transparent) and LOWESS
    curve (yellow, solid line)
  - Perfect title format and professional plotly_white template
  - Good font sizes throughout ensuring readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Well-chosen smoothing fraction (0.3) that captures the trend without overfitting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or more descriptive context (e.g., could use domain-specific
    labels)
  - Manual LOWESS implementation is educational but verbose; could leverage statsmodels
    for production code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with LOWESS regression on a
    white background with a subtle grid. The title "scatter-regression-lowess · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray text. Blue scatter points (Python
    Blue #306998) with moderate transparency (opacity 0.6) show a complex non-linear
    relationship - relatively flat from x=0 to x=4, then curving upward steeply from
    x=5 to x=10. A smooth yellow/gold LOWESS curve (Python Yellow #FFD43B) with width
    4 overlays the data, clearly showing the underlying trend. The legend is positioned
    in the upper-left corner with "Data Points" and "LOWESS Curve" entries on a semi-transparent
    white background. X-axis is labeled "X Value" (0-10), Y-axis is labeled "Y Value"
    (-5 to 20). The layout uses a clean plotly_white template with light gray gridlines.'

        comment: Uses go.Figure, go.Scatter with proper marker/line styling, interactive
          HTML export; however, implements LOWESS manually instead of using statsmodels.api.nonparametric.lowess
          which would be more idiomatic for Python
  verdict: APPROVED
