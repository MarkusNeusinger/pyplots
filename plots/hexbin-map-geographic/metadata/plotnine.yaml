review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of hexbin map using manual hexagon polygon construction
    with geom_polygon
  - 'Good use of layered approach: coastline basemap + hexagonal bins'
  - Proper geographic context with realistic NYC-like coordinates and multiple hotspots
  - YlOrRd sequential colormap provides good density differentiation
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra "Taxi Pickup Density" prefix (should be exactly "{spec-id}
    · {library} · pyplots.ai")
  - Some low-density hexagons blend with the coastline due to similar light colors
  - Layout has some wasted whitespace due to coord_fixed ratio constraint
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning map showing taxi pickup
    density across a NYC-like metropolitan region. The visualization uses a YlOrRd
    (yellow-orange-red) sequential colormap ranging from light yellow (low density,
    ~200 pickups) to dark red/maroon (high density, ~1200+ pickups). A light blue
    background represents water, while a gray polygon outline depicts the coastline/land
    boundary. Multiple density hotspots are visible: a high-density maroon cluster
    around downtown (-74.0, 40.75), a red cluster near the airport area (-73.8, 40.68),
    and several orange hexagons in midtown. Lower-density yellow hexagons form the
    periphery representing residential/scattered areas. White edges separate individual
    hexagons for visual clarity. The legend displays "Pickup Count" with a continuous
    color scale. Axis labels include units (Longitude (°) and Latitude (°)).'
