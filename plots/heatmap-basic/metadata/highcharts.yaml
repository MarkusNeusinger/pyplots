review:
  strengths:
  - Clean heatmap visualization with excellent cell color differentiation
  - Value annotations in each cell enhance readability
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with logical patterns (lower weekend, higher
    midday)
  - Proper use of Highcharts heatmap module with colorAxis configuration
  - Colorblind-safe single-hue blue colormap
  - Correct title format following pyplots conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend/colorbar could have a title (e.g., Activity Level)
  - Data only shows positive values; spec mentions diverging colormap for +/- values
    (not implemented, though not strictly required for basic)
  - Total and Avg rows/columns semantically unclear in the context of the data
