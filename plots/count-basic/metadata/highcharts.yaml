review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent adherence to specification: automatically counts raw categorical data
    and sorts by frequency (descending)'
  - Clean, professional appearance with good use of Python Blue color scheme
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Data labels on bars enhance readability without cluttering
  - Realistic survey satisfaction scenario makes the plot immediately understandable
  - Correct implementation of Highcharts PNG export pattern with inline JS embedding
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include contextual units or be more descriptive (e.g., "Number
    of Responses" instead of just "Count")
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features in the HTML output (tooltips
    are standard but animations could be showcased)
