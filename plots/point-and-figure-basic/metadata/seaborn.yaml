review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Point and Figure chart logic with proper box size and
    reversal handling
  - Clear visual distinction between rising (X) and falling (O) columns using both
    color and shape
  - Appropriate data generation with realistic stock price patterns including trend
    periods
  - Well-formatted title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good axis labeling with units on the Y-axis
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a function calculate_pnf() instead of inline code, violating KISS principle
  - Missing support/resistance trend lines mentioned in the specification
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features (e.g., context settings, built-in
    palettes)
  image_description: The plot displays a Point and Figure chart with alternating columns
    of green X markers (rising prices) and red O markers (falling prices). The chart
    spans approximately 21 columns on the X-axis labeled "Column (Reversals)" with
    prices ranging from roughly $82 to $150 on the Y-axis labeled "Price ($)". The
    title reads "point-and-figure-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper
    left shows "X (Rising)" in green and "O (Falling)" in red. The chart demonstrates
    clear price movement patterns with multiple trend reversals - an initial downtrend
    from columns 2-3, followed by an uptrend through columns 4-8, several reversals
    in the middle section, and a strong uptrend from columns 17-21. The grid is subtle
    with dashed horizontal lines and dotted vertical lines.
