review:
  strengths:
  - Clean visual design with appropriate transparency for overlapping regions
  - Correct calculation and display of all 7 Venn diagram regions
  - Good colorblind-accessible color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with centered layout
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs leveraging Bokeh dual export capability
  weaknesses:
  - Missing display of total set sizes (100, 80, 60) near set labels
  - Contains a helper function circle_points which should be inlined for KISS compliance
  - Title and set label font sizes could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive features (tooltips showing region details)
