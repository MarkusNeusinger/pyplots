review:
  strengths:
  - Clean static representation of drilldown concept using faceting
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with facet_wrap to show two hierarchy
    levels
  - Good color coding with consistent blue shades for Americas breakdown
  - Value labels clearly displayed above each bar
  - Proper title format and descriptive subtitle explaining the static approach
  weaknesses:
  - Spec requires interactive drilldown (click to drill, breadcrumbs, animations)
    which plotnine cannot implement
  - Large empty gap between facets creates unbalanced layout
  - X-axis labels appear to run together (AmericasAsia Pacific missing space)
  - Right panel appears visually smaller than left panel due to fewer/smaller bars
  image_description: 'The plot displays a faceted bar chart showing a static representation
    of hierarchical drilldown functionality. The left panel titled "1. All Regions"
    shows four vertical bars representing regions: Americas (720, dark blue), Asia
    Pacific (713, medium blue), Europe (610, yellow), and MEA (220, orange). The right
    panel titled "2. All > Americas" shows the drilldown view with four countries:
    Brazil (85), Canada (120), Mexico (65), and USA (450), all in shades of blue.
    The title "bar-drilldown · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed in blue at the
    top, with a gray subtitle explaining the static drilldown concept. Value labels
    are displayed above each bar. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales ($ millions)" and the
    X-axis labels show category names. The layout uses plotnine''s facet_wrap to display
    two hierarchy levels side by side.'
