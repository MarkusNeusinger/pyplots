review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including diagonal reference
    line, 10 bins, both Brier score and ECE metrics
  - Clean integration of histogram showing prediction distribution at the bottom without
    requiring a separate subplot
  - Good color scheme with blue calibration curve, gray reference diagonal, and yellow
    histogram bars
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with good reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - The calibration curve is quite extreme - fraction of positives jumps from near
    0 to near 1 very sharply around the 0.3-0.6 probability range, making the miscalibration
    pattern less gradual than typical real-world examples
  - Histogram bars extend quite high (normalized to max) which visually competes with
    the calibration curve; could use smaller scale factor
