review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair transform_density for KDE calculation with configurable
    bandwidth
  - Clean bimodal distribution effectively demonstrates density plot capabilities
  - Proper font sizing ensures excellent readability at high resolution
  - Interactive tooltips and HTML export leverage Altair interactive strengths
  - Python Blue color scheme maintains project consistency
  weaknesses:
  - Some test score values extend beyond typical 0-100 range due to normal distribution
    tails
  - Rug plot (optional per spec) not included
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bimodal density curve (KDE) in Python Blue
    (#306998) with a filled area and darker stroke outline. The title "density-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in appropriate font size. The X-axis
    shows "Test Score (points)" ranging from approximately 10 to 110, and the Y-axis
    displays "Probability Density" from 0.000 to 0.026. Two distinct peaks are visible:
    a primary peak around 34-36 and a secondary peak around 66-70, demonstrating clear
    bimodal distribution. The area under the curve has 70% opacity fill with a subtle
    grid in the background. All text elements (title, axis labels, tick labels) are
    clearly legible.'
