review:
  strengths:
  - Correct and complete Campbell Diagram with all key components (mode curves, EO
    lines, critical speed markers)
  - Clean, deterministic data generation with realistic rotordynamics context and
    proper mode shape naming
  - Good use of zorder for visual layering (modes on top of EO lines, markers on top
    of everything)
  - Smart intersection-finding algorithm using sign changes with linear interpolation
  - Proper explicit font sizing throughout, following matplotlib library rules exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is too large (9 entries) and placed in upper-left where it covers mode
    curves; consider placing it outside the plot or using a more compact layout
  - No visual storytelling — critical speed intersections are marked but there is
    no emphasis on which are most significant (e.g., operating range shading, annotation
    of the most dangerous crossings)
  - Mode curves have very subtle speed-dependent variation (slopes 0.0003-0.0008),
    making the diagram look like mostly horizontal lines; more pronounced gyroscopic
    effects would make it more visually interesting
  - EO line labels (1x, 2x, 3x) could be positioned more carefully to avoid visual
    clutter near the plot edge
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with 5 natural frequency
    mode curves plotted against Rotational Speed (RPM) on the x-axis and Frequency
    (Hz) on the y-axis. The mode curves are: 1st Bending (blue, ~18 Hz, rising slightly),
    2nd Bending (orange, ~45 Hz, falling slightly), 1st Torsional (green, ~62 Hz,
    nearly flat), Axial (purple, ~78 Hz, falling slightly), and 3rd Bending (brown,
    ~95 Hz, rising slightly). Three gray dashed engine order lines (1x, 2x, 3x) radiate
    from the origin with increasing slopes. Red circular markers with white edges
    highlight critical speed intersections where engine order lines cross mode curves.
    The title reads "campbell-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Top and right spines
    are removed, with a subtle y-axis grid. A 9-item legend sits in the upper-left
    corner covering some of the data area.'
