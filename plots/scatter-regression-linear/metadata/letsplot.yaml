quality_score: 93
review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: regression line, 95% CI band,
    R² annotation, and equation'
  - Clean, publication-quality visualization with proper color scheme and contrast
  - Interactive tooltips enhance the lets-plot experience by showing individual data
    point values on hover
  - Well-positioned annotation that does not overlap with data points
  - Realistic business analytics scenario that clearly demonstrates the purpose of
    regression analysis
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses dashed lines which may be slightly distracting; solid subtle
    lines might be cleaner
  - Wildcard import pattern (from lets_plot import *) is necessary but not ideal
  - Points could be slightly larger (size=6-7) for optimal visibility at 100 data
    points
