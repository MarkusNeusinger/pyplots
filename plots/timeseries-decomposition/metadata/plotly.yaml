  strengths:
  - Clean four-panel layout with well-differentiated components using distinct colors
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for authentic time series decomposition
  - 'Title follows required format exactly: timeseries-decomposition · plotly · pyplots.ai'
  - Excellent use of Plotly subplots with shared x-axes for time alignment
  - Realistic airline passenger data scenario with clear trend and seasonality
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label for Original subplot says Passengers (thousands) but other subplots
    lack units context
  - Trend subplot y-axis label just says Trend without indicating the unit is still
    passengers
  image_description: The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked subplots sharing a common x-axis spanning from 2014 to 2023. The top panel
    shows the **Original** series in Python blue (#306998) depicting airline passenger
    data fluctuating between ~100-270 with clear upward trend and seasonal oscillations.
    The second panel shows the **Trend** component in sea green (#2E8B57), displaying
    a smooth upward curve from ~120 to ~250. The third panel shows the **Seasonal
    Component** in orange (#E07020) with a regular sinusoidal pattern oscillating
    between approximately -30 and +30, repeating annually. The bottom panel shows
    the **Residual** in purple (#8B4789), displaying random noise fluctuating around
    zero between -20 and +20. The title "timeseries-decomposition · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. Light grid lines aid readability across all panels. The
    x-axis label "Date" appears only on the bottom subplot.
