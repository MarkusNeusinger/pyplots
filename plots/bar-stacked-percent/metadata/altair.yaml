review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with proper encoding types (:N,
    :Q)
  - Perfect implementation of 100% stacking using stack="normalize"
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual contrast between segments
  - Real-world energy mix data scenario that perfectly demonstrates proportional comparison
  - Clean segment separation with white strokes improves readability
  - Interactive tooltips enhance data exploration
  - Consistent component ordering across all bars
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label "Share of Energy Mix" could include explicit unit notation like "(%)"
    even though format shows percentages
