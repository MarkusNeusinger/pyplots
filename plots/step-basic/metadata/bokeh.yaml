review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh native step() glyph with after mode for proper step visualization
  - Well-chosen color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) markers
    providing clear visual contrast
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for 4800x2700 canvas (48pt title, 36pt labels, 28pt
    ticks)
  - Clean realistic data scenario (monthly cumulative sales) that perfectly demonstrates
    step plot utility
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for Bokeh best practices
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (dashed lines are slightly prominent)
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart showing cumulative sales over
    12 months. The visualization uses a blue step line (#306998) with yellow circular
    markers (#FFD43B) at each data point. The chart has a light gray background (#fafafa)
    with dashed grid lines at 0.3 alpha. The title "step-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. The x-axis is labeled "Month" (1-12) and the y-axis is
    labeled "Cumulative Sales (units)" (0-200). The step pattern clearly shows the
    stair-step progression from 15 units in January to 195 units in December, with
    horizontal lines extending to the right of each data point ("after" mode).

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and Bokeh's native step() glyph with mode parameter,
          plus scatter for markers. Good but could showcase more Bokeh-specific features
          like hover tools.
  verdict: APPROVED
