review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar bar chart implementation with proper stacking for wind speed categories
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between segments
  - Realistic meteorological data showing prevailing westerly wind pattern
  - Clean, readable layout with well-positioned legend
  - Proper use of Highcharts polar column type with highcharts-more.js module
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label says Frequency (%) but data values appear to be raw counts, not percentages
  - Could leverage more Highcharts interactive features like data labels on segments
    or custom tooltips
