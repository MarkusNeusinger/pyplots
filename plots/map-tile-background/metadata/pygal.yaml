review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution extending pygal Graph class to implement tile-map functionality
    not natively supported
  - Realistic European landmark data with accurate coordinates and plausible visitor
    counts
  - Good visual styling with OSM-like colors and white marker outlines for contrast
  - Proper tile provider attribution as required by OSM terms
  - Legend with actual data ranges calculated from the dataset
  - White grid lines effectively simulate tile divisions
  weaknesses:
  - Uses custom class structure (TileBackgroundMap) which violates KISS principle
  - Axis labels lack units or descriptive context beyond Latitude/Longitude
  - Legend placement overlaps with the Scandinavia land mass visualization area
  image_description: The plot displays a map of Europe showing landmark visitor data.
    The background simulates a tile-based map with ocean areas in light blue (#aad3df)
    and land masses in beige (#f2efe9) as simplified polygons representing the Iberian
    Peninsula, France, British Isles, Italy, Greece/Balkans, Scandinavia, and Central
    Europe. 15 blue circular markers represent major European landmarks (Eiffel Tower,
    Colosseum, Louvre, etc.) with sizes proportional to annual visitor counts (1,300K
    to 9,600K). White grid lines simulate map tile divisions. The title "European
    Landmarks · map-tile-background · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axes
    show Latitude (34°-60°) and Longitude (-12° to 32°). A legend in the upper right
    shows three size categories corresponding to visitor count ranges. Attribution
    "© OpenStreetMap style (simulated)" appears in the lower right corner.
