quality_score: 86
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean declarative composition using alt.layer() to combine band and line
  - Confidence interval appropriately widens over time, demonstrating realistic forecast
    uncertainty
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs with tooltips
  - Excellent code structure with clear comments explaining the data generation
  - Proper use of Altair encoding types (Q for quantitative)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the central line and confidence band (spec explicitly
    requires this)
  - Y-axis scale starts at 0 which creates unnecessary whitespace; data ranges from
    ~95-180 but axis goes 0-200
  - No point markers on the line to show actual data points (would enhance clarity)
