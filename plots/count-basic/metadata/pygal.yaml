review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of logical category ordering (satisfaction scale from negative to
    positive)
  - Clean implementation with appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of Counter for automatic frequency counting from raw data
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability
  - Realistic customer satisfaction survey scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity)
  - Axis labels could include units for clarity (e.g., Number of Responses instead
    of Count)
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing customer satisfaction
    survey responses across 5 categories ordered logically from "Very Dissatisfied"
    to "Very Satisfied". The bars are rendered in a consistent muted blue color (#306998)
    with count values (1, 5, 8, 21, 15) displayed on top of each bar. The title "count-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The x-axis is labeled "Satisfaction
    Level" and y-axis is labeled "Count". Horizontal dotted grid lines aid readability.
    The chart uses a white background with good spacing between bars and balanced
    margins.
