review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circos plot structure with properly implemented outer ring, inner data
    track, and bezier ribbon connections
  - Good visual design with appropriate gaps between segments and proper text rotation
    logic
  - KISS structure maintained - bezier curve calculation is now inline rather than
    in a function
  - Legend added to explain the three visual encodings (outer ring, inner track, ribbons)
  - Realistic global trade flow scenario demonstrates the visualization effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" as the primary format,
    with descriptive subtitle below
  - Seaborn usage limited to styling (set_theme) and color palette - does not use
    seaborn plotting functions
  - Some ribbon connections with smaller values are difficult to distinguish due to
    thin widths
  - Adjacent green shades (South Asia, Southeast Asia) could be more distinct
