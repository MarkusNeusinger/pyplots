review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lollipop chart using clever combination of scatter
    (dots) and column (stems) series
  - Data is properly sorted in descending order for optimal readability as recommended
    in spec
  - Data labels positioned above markers provide clear value indication
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color choice
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Good use of marginBottom to prevent x-axis label clipping
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend score slightly reduced as grid style could be more subtle (alpha lower)
  - Layout has slight imbalance due to large bottom margin creating extra whitespace
  - 'Could leverage more Highcharts interactive features (tooltips are disabled via
    enableMouseTracking: False on stems)'
  image_description: The plot displays a basic lollipop chart showing product sales
    by category. Eight categories are displayed on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing,
    Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Jewelry, Automotive), with "Sales (Units)"
    on the y-axis ranging from 0 to 9000. Each data point consists of a thin blue
    vertical stem (#306998) extending from the baseline to a circular blue marker
    at the top. Data labels are positioned above each marker showing exact values
    (8,500 down to 1,800). The data is sorted in descending order from left to right.
    The title "lollipop-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The background
    is white with subtle dashed gray grid lines.

        comment: Uses Highcharts scatter+column combination creatively for lollipop
          effect, but could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like animations
          or tooltips
