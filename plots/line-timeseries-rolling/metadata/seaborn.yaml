review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between raw data (thin, semi-transparent blue) and
    rolling average (thick, prominent yellow)
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-chosen window size (7-day) clearly shown in legend
  - Clean seasonal trend from winter to summer demonstrates the smoothing effect beautifully
  - Good use of seaborn DataFrame-native plotting with sns.lineplot
  - Proper font scaling using sns.set_context
  weaknesses:
  - Raw data line could be slightly more prominent (perhaps linewidth=2 or alpha=0.5)
    to better show daily fluctuations
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like confidence intervals or statistical
    annotations
  - Grid legend has framealpha=0.9 which could be reduced slightly for a cleaner look
  image_description: The plot shows a time series of daily temperature data spanning
    from January 2024 to July 2024. The raw daily temperature is displayed as a thin,
    semi-transparent blue line (#306998) with visible daily fluctuations ranging from
    approximately -5°C to 25°C. Overlaid on top is a prominent golden/yellow (#FFD43B)
    7-day rolling average line that smoothly traces the underlying seasonal trend
    from winter cold (around 0°C) through spring warming to summer temperatures (peaking
    around 20°C). The title "line-timeseries-rolling · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top in bold. The x-axis shows "Date" with monthly tick labels rotated at
    30 degrees, and the y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)". A legend in the upper left
    clearly distinguishes "Daily Temperature" from "7-Day Rolling Average". A subtle
    dashed grid aids readability.

        comment: Uses `sns.lineplot` with DataFrame integration and `sns.set_style`/`sns.set_context`
          for styling; however, doesn't leverage more advanced seaborn statistical
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
