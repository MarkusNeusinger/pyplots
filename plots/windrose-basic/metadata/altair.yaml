review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative approach constructing polar wind rose in Altair using Cartesian-to-polar
    coordinate transformation
  - Clean stacked wedge visualization with proper ordering and segment stacking
  - Good color progression (Python blue to yellow to orange to red) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper meteorological convention with North at top
  - Interactive tooltips showing direction, speed range, and frequency percentage
  - Well-implemented reference grid with concentric circles and radial lines
  - Frequency axis clearly labeled with percentage values
  weaknesses:
  - Percentage labels (5%, 10%, etc.) could be slightly larger for better visibility
  - The Frequency (%) axis title text overlaps slightly with the 15%/20% labels area
