review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling showing energy transition narrative (solar growth,
    coal decline)
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette following Python branding guidelines
  - Stack totals displayed above each bar as recommended in specification
  - Data labels within segments aid precise value reading
  - Proper use of Highcharts stacking configuration with white borders between segments
  - Well-configured tooltips showing both individual and total values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement conflicts with X-axis title - they visually overlap
  - Data labels within segments could be slightly larger for better readability at
    full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked column chart showing monthly energy
    consumption by source (Jan-Jun). Four energy sources are stacked vertically: Solar
    (teal/cyan at bottom), Natural Gas (yellow), Nuclear (purple), and Coal (darker
    blue at top). Each bar shows individual segment values as data labels and stack
    totals above (ranging from 1,225 to 1,317 MWh). The title correctly shows "bar-stacked
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a descriptive subtitle. A horizontal legend at
    the bottom identifies all four components. The Y-axis is labeled "Energy (MWh)"
    and X-axis shows "Month".'
