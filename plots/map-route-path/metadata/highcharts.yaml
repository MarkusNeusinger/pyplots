review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic hiking trail scenario with Swiss Alps coordinates and elevation
    simulation
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme with shape differentiation (circle for start,
    square for end)
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data generation
  - Proper use of Highcharts Maps with topology data and mappoint/mapline series
  weaknesses:
  - Route path is very small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas - needs better zoom
    level or map bounds adjustment
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library (Chart class) as specified in
    library rules, instead uses raw JSON configuration
  - Color gradient along path for time progression mentioned in spec notes but not
    implemented
  - Unused gradient_points variable suggests incomplete implementation of time-based
    coloring
  - Legend shows incorrect symbol for Route (dot instead of line representation)
  image_description: The plot displays a geographic map of Europe with a hiking route
    path visualized in the Swiss Alps region. The background shows country borders
    in light gray (#e8e8e8) with darker gray border lines. The route is shown as a
    blue (#306998) line connecting waypoints from east to west. Yellow circular markers
    with blue borders appear at regular intervals along the route (every 10th waypoint).
    A large green circle marks the START point on the east side with "START" label
    in green text above it. A red square marks the END point on the west side with
    "END" label in red text above it. The title reads "Alpine Hiking Trail · map-route-path
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle describing "GPS track from Zermatt
    region through the Swiss Alps (150 waypoints, 6-hour hike)". A legend in the top-right
    corner shows Route (blue), Start (green), and End (red) markers. The route itself
    is relatively small compared to the overall canvas, with significant empty space
    around it.
