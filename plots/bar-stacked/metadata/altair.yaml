review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (O, Q,
    N)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between segments
  - Total value labels above stacks as recommended in spec
  - Clean white stroke separators between bar segments improve readability
  - Tooltips add interactivity for HTML output
  - Proper stacking order (largest category at bottom) using Order encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned slightly far from the chart area, creating visual separation
  - Could use Altair selection features for interactive highlighting
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly sales
    (Q1-Q4) by product category. Four distinct stacked segments are visible per bar:
    Electronics (blue, #306998) at the bottom, Clothing (orange, #E69F00), Home &
    Garden (teal, #009E73), and Sports (yellow, #F0E442) at the top. Total value labels
    appear above each stack (230, 259, 232, 321). The y-axis shows "Sales (Thousands
    USD)" ranging from 0-340, and the x-axis shows "Quarter". A clear legend titled
    "Product Category" is positioned on the right. The title reads "bar-stacked ·
    altair · pyplots.ai" at the top center. White stroke separators between segments
    enhance readability. The chart demonstrates clear growth in Q4.'
