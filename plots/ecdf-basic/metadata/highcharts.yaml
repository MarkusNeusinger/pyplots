review:
  strengths:
  - Correct ECDF implementation with step=left creating proper vertical jumps at each
    data point
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle dashed grid lines
  - Proper Y-axis range from 0 to 1 as required for cumulative proportion
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Follows library-specific guidelines for Selenium-based PNG export
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at bottom center could be repositioned to avoid overlap with
    x-axis label
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Value (units) would be more descriptive)
  - Data uses a simple normal distribution; a slightly more interesting distribution
    would better demonstrate ECDF capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays an ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) step chart on a white background. The title "ecdf-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top in bold black text. The X-axis
    is labeled "Value" and ranges from approximately 10 to 86, representing the sample
    values from a normal distribution. The Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion"
    and correctly ranges from 0 to 1. The ECDF is rendered as a blue (#306998 Python
    Blue) step function line that rises from left to right in a characteristic S-curve
    shape typical of normally distributed data. Dashed gray grid lines are present
    on both axes to aid in reading values. A legend showing "ECDF" appears at the
    bottom center. The chart uses the step="left" configuration, creating proper vertical
    jumps at each data point.
