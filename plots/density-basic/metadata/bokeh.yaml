review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule for bandwidth selection
  - Clean rug plot implementation showing individual observations as vertical segments
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Bimodal data effectively demonstrates distribution analysis use case
  - Realistic web service response time scenario with meaningful context
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive capabilities (hover tooltips showing density
    values)
  - Grid styling could be more prominent for better readability
  - The rug plot ticks could be slightly more visible (currently line_width=2 with
    alpha=0.5)
