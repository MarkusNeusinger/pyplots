review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of the specialized Skew-T Log-P thermodynamic diagram
  - All required reference lines present (isotherms, dry adiabats, moist adiabats,
    mixing ratio)
  - Proper logarithmic inverted pressure axis
  - Good color coding distinguishing temperature/dewpoint profiles and reference line
    types
  - Clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data
  weaknesses:
  - Minor tick label overlap at 900/925 hPa levels
  - Reference line labels at top edge are faint and may be hard to read
  - Implementation relies heavily on matplotlib for the specialized diagram construction
    rather than showcasing seaborn distinctive features
  - No explicit grid styling (reference lines serve as implicit grid)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram on a light gray background (#fafafa). The y-axis shows Pressure (hPa) with logarithmic scaling, inverted from 1000 hPa at the bottom to 100 hPa at the top. The x-axis shows Temperature (°C) ranging from -50 to 50. Two main data profiles are plotted: a solid red line with circle markers representing Temperature, and a dashed blue line with square markers representing Dewpoint. The temperature profile starts at ~25°C at surface (1000 hPa) and decreases to ~-55°C at 100 hPa. The dewpoint profile follows a similar pattern but is consistently lower than temperature (showing the dewpoint depression).

    Reference lines are overlaid: gray diagonal isotherms (45-degree skew), brown dry adiabats, green dashed moist adiabats, and blue dotted mixing ratio lines. Labels for these reference lines appear at the top edge ("Dry Adiabats", "Moist Adiabats", "Mixing Ratio") and right edge ("Isotherms" rotated 45°). The legend in the upper right clearly identifies Temperature and Dewpoint profiles. The title correctly reads "skewt-logp-atmospheric · seaborn · pyplots.ai" with middle dot separators.

        comment: While sns.lineplot() is used, the bulk of the visualization relies
          heavily on matplotlib. A more seaborn-idiomatic approach would leverage
          seaborn's statistical capabilities more directly.
