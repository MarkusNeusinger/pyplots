review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wind rose concept using pygal Radar chart with proper
    stacking approach
  - Correct meteorological convention with North at top
  - Realistic wind data simulation with prevailing SW/W patterns typical of mid-latitude
    locations
  - Clean code structure with clear comments explaining each section
  - Proper use of custom Style for scaling to large canvas size
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme is inverted from meteorological convention (should be cool colors
    for calm/low speeds, warm for strong/high speeds)
  - Radial axis tick labels could be larger for better readability
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent compared to data
