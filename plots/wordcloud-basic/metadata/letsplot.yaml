review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spiral word placement algorithm with collision detection - all 26 words
    visible without overlap
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual variety
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_text + scales + theme)
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio (1600x900 base, scaled 3x to 4800x2700)
  - Realistic programming language popularity data
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (scale_size, place_words) which violates KISS structure
    requirement - should be inline code
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with more whitespace on right side of canvas
  - Smallest words (Elixir) could be slightly larger for better readability at full
    size
