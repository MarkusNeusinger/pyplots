review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to network visualization using pygal XY chart with discontinuous
    line segments for edges
  - Excellent color scheme with four distinct colorblind-safe colors for hierarchy
    levels
  - Well-structured organizational data with realistic role names and clear parent-child
    relationships
  - Good use of pygal Style customization for fonts and colors
  - Large visible node markers appropriate for data density
  - Proper title format and legend with level names
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too prominent - should use more subtle styling
  - Y-axis label is rotated vertically making it harder to read quickly
  - Node labels are only visible on hover/tooltip not on the static PNG
  - Reporting Lines legend entry shows no visible indicator
  - Y-axis shows 0-100 coordinate values rather than intuitive level numbers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical network graph representing
    an organizational chart with 22 nodes across 4 levels. The CEO (blue node) sits
    at the top (y~145), with 3 VPs (yellow nodes) at y~116, 7 Directors (teal/cyan
    nodes) at y~73, and 11 Managers (coral/red nodes) at the bottom (y~20). Gray lines
    connect parent nodes to children, clearly showing reporting relationships. The
    layout uses an XY coordinate system with "Horizontal Position (Peer Distribution)"
    on the x-axis and "Management Level (0=Top, 3=Bottom)" on the y-axis. A legend
    at the bottom identifies each level: "Reporting Lines", "Level 0: Executive",
    "Level 1: VPs", "Level 2: Directors", "Level 3: Managers". The title follows the
    correct format "network-hierarchical · pygal · pyplots.ai". Node sizes are large
    and clearly visible, with good color contrast between levels. The grid lines are
    quite prominent (dark gray).'
