review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of plotnine primitives (geom_segment, geom_point, geom_text) to construct
    a hive plot
  - Excellent real-world data example with software module dependencies
  - Good color scheme that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper curved edges using Bezier interpolation
  - Clean visual presentation with theme_void
  weaknesses:
  - 'Code uses a function definition which violates the KISS structure requirement
    (must be flat: imports → data → plot → save)'
  - Edge transparency (alpha=0.25) is too low making connections hard to see
  - Node distribution is unbalanced (11 utility nodes clustered together vs 4-5 on
    other axes)
  - Nodes on UTILITY axis are clustered too tightly making individual nodes hard to
    distinguish
  - Figure size is 12x12 (square) but should use appropriate sizing with dpi=300
