review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Dirichlet distribution to create realistic, varied soil composition
    data with clusters near each vertex
  - Clean implementation of ternary coordinate transformation from compositional data
    to Cartesian coordinates
  - Well-structured grid lines at 20% intervals with appropriate subtlety (alpha=0.6)
  - Good data point sizing and alpha (size=5, alpha=0.8) appropriate for 50-point
    dataset
  - Professional soil science context with proper component labeling
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: uses "Soil Composition · ternary-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    instead of the required "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" format'
  image_description: The plot displays a ternary diagram showing soil composition
    data (sand, silt, clay percentages). The triangle has a dark blue (#306998) border
    with a white fill. Gray grid lines are drawn at 20% intervals inside the triangle.
    Approximately 50 blue data points are scattered throughout the triangle, showing
    varied soil compositions with clusters near each vertex (sand-heavy, silt-heavy,
    and clay-heavy samples). The three vertices are labeled "Sand (%)", "Silt (%)",
    and "Clay (%)" in bold blue text. Tick labels (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) appear
    along all three edges in gray. The title reads "Soil Composition · ternary-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold black text at the top.

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_polygon
          + geom_segment + geom_point + geom_text + theme_void), but ternary plots
          require manual coordinate transformation rather than native plotnine features
  verdict: APPROVED
