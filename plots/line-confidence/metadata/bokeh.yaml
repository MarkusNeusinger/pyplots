review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of varea glyph for the confidence band, which is idiomatic Bokeh
  - Clean ColumnDataSource usage for data management
  - Widening confidence interval effectively demonstrates prediction uncertainty concept
  - Appropriate font scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Semi-transparent band (alpha 0.3) maintains readability per spec guidelines
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner is cramped and slightly overlaps with plot
    area visually
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with a 95% confidence interval
    band on a light gray (#fafafa) background. The title "line-confidence · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left in a reasonably sized font. A legend in
    the top-left corner identifies "Prediction" (dark blue line) and "95% Confidence
    Interval" (light blue shaded band). The x-axis is labeled "Time (units)" ranging
    from 0 to 10, and the y-axis is labeled "Predicted Value" ranging from approximately
    0 to 20. The central prediction line shows an upward curving trend with some noise,
    starting around 2 and ending around 16. The confidence band is semi-transparent
    and widens progressively as time increases, effectively demonstrating growing
    uncertainty in predictions. Dashed grid lines are subtle in the background.

        comment: Uses varea for confidence band and ColumnDataSource, but could leverage
