review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_bar +
    geom_text + coord_flip)
  - Data is properly sorted ascending so largest values appear at top after coord_flip
  - Value labels positioned cleanly at bar ends with appropriate nudge
  - Professional minimal theme with well-scaled text sizes for high-resolution output
  - Realistic, relatable data context (programming language popularity)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses element_text instead of element_line for panel_grid_major_x
    and panel_grid_minor (should be element_line(color=...))
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing "Top 10 programming
    languages by popularity" with programming languages on the Y-axis and developer
    usage percentage on the X-axis. JavaScript leads at 65.6%, followed by Python
    at 49.3%, with Swift at the bottom at 6.6%. The bars are a consistent steel blue
    color (#306998), extending horizontally from left to right. Each bar has a percentage
    label positioned just to the right of the bar end. The title "bar-horizontal ·
    plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The minimal theme provides
    a clean white background with subtle gray grid lines. The layout is well-balanced
    with the plot filling the canvas appropriately.
