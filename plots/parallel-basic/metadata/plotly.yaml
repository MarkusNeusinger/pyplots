review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Iris dataset as a realistic, well-understood multivariate example
  - Clean three-species color coding makes patterns immediately visible
  - Proper axis labeling with units (cm) throughout
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good font sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Appropriate use of colorbar with categorical labels instead of continuous scale
    interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Could add alpha/opacity to lines for better handling of overlapping paths when
    species overlap
  - Missing explicit Plotly interactivity configuration (hover templates, axis brushing
    hints) that would showcase library strengths
  - Yellow-green color distinction in colorscale may be challenging for some colorblind
    users; consider using a more distinct three-color discrete palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization of Iris
    flower measurements with four vertical axes: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm),
    Petal Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). Lines connect data points across all
    dimensions, colored by species using a blue-yellow-green gradient colorscale.
    A vertical colorbar on the right indicates three species: Setosa (blue at bottom),
    Versicolor (yellow in middle), and Virginica (green at top). The background is
    white/clean. The three species clusters are clearly distinguishable - Setosa lines
    (blue) show notably smaller petal measurements clustering at the lower range of
    petal axes, Versicolor (yellow) occupies middle ranges, and Virginica (green)
    shows higher values especially for petal length and width. The title "Iris Flower
    Measurements · parallel-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.'

          some overlap is inevitable; transparency could be slightly higher for better

          clean white background works well for parallel coords

        comment: Uses go.Parcoords which is Plotly-specific, but doesn't leverage
          interactivity features that make Plotly distinctive (hover tooltips, brushing/filtering
          on axes, custom hover templates). HTML output is generated but no interactive
          features are explicitly configured beyond defaults.
  verdict: APPROVED
