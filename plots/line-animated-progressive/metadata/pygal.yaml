review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of progressive animation spec for a static library by
    using small multiples approach
  - Consistent y-axis range across panels enables meaningful visual comparison of
    data progression
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate color scheme (Python blue +
    orange highlight)
  - Both PNG (small multiples) and HTML (interactive overlay) outputs provide complementary
    viewing experiences
  - Realistic website traffic data scenario that naturally benefits from progressive
    reveal storytelling
  - Good use of cubic interpolation for smooth lines
  weaknesses:
  - The orange trailing highlight on the last point is too subtle; the transition
    between main line (blue) and highlighted segment (orange) could be more visually
    prominent to better indicate current position
  - Panel subtitles (e.g., January - March) duplicate information already shown in
    the panel titles; could use subtitle space more effectively
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples layout showing the progressive revelation of website traffic data over 12 months. The four panels represent different stages of data accumulation:

    - Stage 1 (Q1 Data): Shows January through March with 3 data points, line growing from ~50,000 to ~61,000 visitors
    - Stage 2 (H1 Data): Shows January through June with 6 data points, revealing the spring peak around April (~67,000)
    - Stage 3 (9 Months): Shows January through September with 9 data points, displaying summer fluctuations
    - Stage 4 (Full Year): Shows the complete 12-month dataset with year-end growth reaching ~79,000 visitors

    Each panel uses Python blue (#306998) for the main line with orange (#FF6B35) highlighting on the trailing segment. The y-axis shows "Visitors" with consistent range (45,000-82,000) across all panels for visual consistency. X-axis shows all 12 months with horizontal labels. The main title "line-animated-progressive · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray. Horizontal grid lines provide reference. The data shows an upward trend with seasonal variation, creating a realistic website traffic pattern.
