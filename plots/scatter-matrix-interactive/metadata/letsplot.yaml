review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style code using ggbunch for complex grid layout
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast
  - Abbreviated axis labels prevent text crowding in tight matrix cells
  - Proper histogram overlays on diagonal with alpha transparency
  - Realistic iris-like synthetic data with species clustering
  - Hover tooltips provide basic interactivity for data exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Lacks linked brushing/selection across subplots (core spec requirement)
  - No zoom/pan functionality as specified
  - No selection reset mechanism
  - Legend appears disconnected as separate ggbunch element at bottom
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) showing
    pairwise relationships between 4 iris-like variables: Sepal Length, Sepal Width,
    Petal Length, and Petal Width. Three species (Setosa in blue, Versicolor in orange,
    Virginica in teal/green) are distinguished by color. The diagonal cells show overlapping
    histograms for univariate distributions with alpha transparency. Off-diagonal
    cells contain scatter plots with colored points. The title "scatter-matrix-interactive
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom shows the
    species color mapping. Axis labels use abbreviated names (Sepal Len., Sepal Wid.,
    etc.) on the left and bottom edges only. Points have alpha=0.7 for visibility
    of overlapping data.'

        comment: Implementation acknowledges lets-plot lacks linked brushing. Only
          uses basic hover tooltips via layer_tooltips(), which is minimal interactivity.
          ggbunch for layout is a lets-plot feature but does not compensate for missing
          core interactive functionality required by spec.
