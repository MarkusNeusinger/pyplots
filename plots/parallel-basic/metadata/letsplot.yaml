review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of parallel coordinates using lets-plot ggplot2 grammar
  - Clean visual separation of species clusters demonstrates visualization power
  - Proper normalization of dimensions to 0-1 scale for fair comparison
  - Descriptive axis labels with units enhance interpretability
  - Good color palette with sufficient contrast between species
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.7) handles line overlap effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Tick value labels (min/max) positioned slightly far from axes and could be larger
  - Yellow color for Versicolor could have more saturation for better visibility against
    white
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization of the
    Iris dataset with 4 dimensions (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal
    Width). Four vertical black axes are evenly spaced across the canvas. 30 observation
    lines (10 per species) connect values across axes. Lines are colored by species:
    blue for Setosa, yellow for Versicolor, and red for Virginica. Each axis has min/max
    value labels on the left side. Dimension labels appear below each axis with units
    in cm. The title "parallel-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left.
    A legend in the right portion identifies the three species. The background is
    clean white with no grid. Clear visual separation exists between species clusters,
    especially for Setosa (blue lines clustered at low petal values).'
