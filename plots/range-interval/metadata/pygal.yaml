review:
  strengths:
  - Clever implementation using stacked bar with invisible base to create floating
    range bars
  - Clean, professional appearance with good color choice
  - Realistic temperature data showing clear seasonal variation
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Good canvas utilization and layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - Grid & legend could be improved - the invisible series technique leaves legend
    slightly awkward
  - Missing optional endpoint markers at min/max points as suggested in spec notes
  - Could leverage more pygal-specific interactive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges across 12 months (Jan-Dec). Each month is represented by a blue (#306998)
    floating bar that spans from the minimum to maximum temperature for that month.
    The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from -2 to 28, and the x-axis shows
    "Month" with abbreviated month labels. The title correctly reads "range-interval
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend at the bottom displays "Temperature
    Range (°C)". Horizontal grid lines are visible at 2-degree intervals. The bars
    effectively show the seasonal pattern with narrow ranges in winter months (Jan:
    -2 to 6°C, Feb: 0 to 8°C) and wider, higher ranges in summer (Jul: 19 to 28°C).
    The overall layout is clean with good use of whitespace.'

        comment: Title and axis labels are clearly readable. Font sizes are appropriate
          for the canvas size. Tick labels slightly small but still legible.

        comment: Legend placement at bottom is acceptable but the invisible series
          creates a gap. Grid is subtle but works.

        comment: Uses pygal's StackedBar with custom Style effectively. The invisible
          base bar technique is clever. Could use more pygal-specific features like
          tooltips or animation.
