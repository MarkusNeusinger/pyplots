review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    from scratch
  - Clear community clustering visible in the final visualization
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot with hue and size parameters for node differentiation
  - Realistic organizational network scenario with meaningful department structure
  - Well-designed legend with department names and counts
  - Network statistics annotation adds informative context
  - Appropriate edge styling with weight-based thickness and transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Some minor label overlap in dense node regions
  - Grid is absent but could be argued as appropriate for network visualization
  - Force layout is custom code rather than leveraging a network-specific library
    feature
  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph showing an
    organizational social network with 37 nodes distributed across 3 departments.
    The nodes are colored by department: blue (#306998) for Engineering (15 nodes),
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Marketing (12 nodes), and red (#E74C3C) for Sales (10 nodes).
    Node sizes vary based on connection degree - larger nodes indicate more connections
    (hub nodes). Gray edges connect nodes with varying thickness based on connection
    weight. The layout clearly shows community clustering with Engineering nodes primarily
    in the upper-left, Marketing nodes in the upper-right, and Sales nodes scattered
    in the lower portion. High-degree hub nodes are labeled (Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, etc.).
    A legend in the upper-left identifies departments with node counts. The title
    "network-force-directed · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Network statistics
    (Nodes: 37 | Edges: 98 | Avg Degree: 5.3) are shown at the bottom. Axis labels
    indicate "Force-Directed X/Y Position" but tick marks are removed for cleaner
    visualization.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with hue/size mapping and sns.set_theme, but
          force layout is custom numpy code rather than a seaborn-specific feature
  verdict: APPROVED
