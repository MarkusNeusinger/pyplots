  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation algorithm
  - Perfect use of seaborn lineplot with units parameter to plot individual curves
    without aggregation
  - Good choice of colorblind-safe color palette with appropriate transparency
  - Clean separation of species clusters visible in the visualization
  - Correct mathematical notation for x-axis labels using π symbols
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels use mathematical notation only (t, f(t)) without descriptive context
    for newcomers
  - Legend could be positioned to avoid any potential overlap with curve endpoints
  image_description: The plot displays Andrews curves for the Iris dataset with three
    species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) represented by different colors. The x-axis
    shows t values from -π to π with appropriate π notation labels. The y-axis shows
    f(t) values ranging from approximately -4 to 5. Blue curves represent setosa,
    yellow/gold curves represent versicolor, and red/coral curves represent virginica.
    The curves show clear separation between species groups - setosa curves tend toward
    negative f(t) values in the middle region while virginica curves trend higher.
    The legend is positioned in the upper right corner with "Species" as the title.
    The plot has a white grid background with subtle gridlines, and the title follows
    the required format. All 150 observations from the Iris dataset are visualized
    as individual curves with appropriate transparency to show density patterns.

        comment: Good use of sns.lineplot with units parameter for individual curves
          and sns.load_dataset for data loading, but Andrews curves transformation
          is manual (not a seaborn built-in)
  verdict: APPROVED
