review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features implemented (filled polygons,
    transparency, distinct colors, legend, gridlines)
  - Clean KISS code structure following the project standards
  - Good use of custom Style with appropriate font sizes for 3600x3600 canvas
  - Realistic team skill assessment data that clearly demonstrates the comparison
    use case
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in the far corner creates visual separation from the chart; could
    be positioned closer
  - Axis labels on the left side (Technical, Leadership) are rotated/angled which
    reduces readability slightly
  - Yellow series may have reduced visibility against the white background compared
    to the blue and red series
