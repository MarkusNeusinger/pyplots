review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Plotly-specific features: gradient fill, range selector, spike
    lines, custom hover templates, and dual export (PNG + interactive HTML)'
  - Strong data storytelling with peak annotation and trend callout that guide the
    viewer
  - Realistic website traffic data with convincing weekly cyclical patterns and upward
    trend
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 output
  - Clean, readable code with clear separation of data generation components
  weaknesses:
  - The Upward trend +50% annotation floats in empty space below the data line rather
    than being anchored to a visual reference such as a trend line
  - Gradient fill effect is quite subtle in the static PNG rendering — the visual
    difference between top and bottom of the fill area is minimal
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart titled "Daily Website Visitors
    · area-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai". The chart shows 90 days of website visitor
    data from January to March 2024. A single series in Python Blue (#306998) is rendered
    as a smooth spline line with a semi-transparent gradient fill extending from the
    line down to zero. The fill transitions from nearly transparent at the bottom
    to a visible blue at the data line. Clear weekly cyclical patterns (peaks and
    troughs repeating roughly every 7 days) are visible, with an overall upward trend
    from ~5,000 visitors in early January to ~8,000-9,000 by late March. A "Peak:
    8,951" annotation with an arrow points to the highest data point in the upper
    right. An "Upward trend +50%" text annotation sits in the lower right area of
    the chart. Range selector buttons (1W, 1M, All) appear in the upper left corner.
    A legend entry "Daily Visitors" with a blue line icon sits in the upper left below
    the buttons. Gridlines are subtle (low opacity). Y-axis shows comma-formatted
    values from 0 to 9,000+, labeled "Visitors (daily count)". X-axis shows monthly
    ticks (Jan 2024, Feb 2024, Mar 2024), labeled "Date (Q1 2024)". The background
    is clean white (plotly_white template).'

        comment: Custom Python Blue, plotly_white template, gradient fill, spline
