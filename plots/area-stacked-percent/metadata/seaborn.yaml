review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling showing realistic renewable energy market evolution
  - Perfect normalization to 100% throughout the time series
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-chosen colors that are distinguishable
  - Good use of seaborn theming (whitegrid style, talk context)
  - Boundary lines between areas add visual clarity
  - Title format exactly matches specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Other top-to-bottom) is reversed from visual
    stack order (Other, Hydro, Wind, Solar bottom-to-top), which can confuse readers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing the evolution
    of renewable energy sources market share from 2015 to 2024. The chart uses four
    distinct colors: dark blue (Steel blue, #306998) for Solar at the top, golden
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Wind in the middle-upper area, turquoise/teal (#4ECDC4) for
    Hydro in the middle-lower area, and gray (#95A5A6) for Other at the bottom. The
    Y-axis shows "Share (%)" ranging from 0 to 100, and the X-axis shows "Year" from
    2015 to 2024. The title follows the correct format: "area-stacked-percent · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". The legend is positioned in the upper left with a white background.
    The plot clearly shows Solar growing from ~10% to ~45%, Wind growing slightly
    from ~20% to ~35%, Hydro declining from ~50% to ~18%, and Other declining from
    ~20% to ~2%. The areas stack to exactly 100% throughout. Subtle boundary lines
    separate each area. The grid is shown only on the Y-axis with dashed lines at
    low alpha.'

        comment: 'Grid is subtle (alpha 0.3), but legend order (top-to-bottom: Solar,

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme(), sns.set_context(), and sns.lineplot(). However,
          the main plotting (fill_between) uses matplotlib directly. Seaborn doesn't
          have a native stacked area function, so this hybrid approach is acceptable
          but not ideal.
  verdict: APPROVED
