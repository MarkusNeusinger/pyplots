review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of color gradient to show route progression from start to end
  - Clear distinction between start (green) and end (red) markers with appropriate
    legend
  - Well-formatted tooltips showing progress percentage, latitude, and longitude
  - Realistic hiking trail data with natural-looking winding path using cumulative
    offsets
  - Proper coordinate system with fixed aspect ratio for geographic accuracy
  - Good text sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  weaknesses:
  - Missing geographic basemap for spatial context (spec mentions this as beneficial)
  - Two separate legends take up space; could potentially combine or simplify
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hiking trail route path on a coordinate
    system with Longitude (°) on the x-axis (ranging from ~9.805 to ~9.91) and Latitude
    (°) on the y-axis (ranging from ~46.845 to ~46.895). The route forms a winding,
    loop-like path representing a hiking trail in the Swiss Alps area. The path is
    colored using a gradient from dark blue (0% progress) to yellow (100% progress)
    showing journey progression. A green circular marker indicates the start point
    (near 9.85, 46.85) and a red circular marker indicates the end point (near 9.885,
    46.847). The title "map-route-path · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in bold. Two legends are displayed on the right: "Progress (%)" showing the color
    gradient scale from 0-100, and "Markers" showing green for Start and red for End.
    The layout uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines and white background.
    Text is clear and readable at all sizes.'
