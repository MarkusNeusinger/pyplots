review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-layer visualization with clear contrast between raw data and rolling
    average
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that effectively demonstrates the rolling
    average smoothing effect
  - Proper use of alpha transparency for raw data line making the rolling average
    prominent
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Well-formatted date axis with appropriate rotation for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Raw data line could be slightly thinner (linewidth=1 instead of 1.5) for even
    better contrast with rolling average
  - Consider adding a subtle shaded region between raw and rolling average to emphasize
    the smoothing effect
  image_description: The plot displays a time series of daily temperature data over
    6 months (January 2024 to July 2024). The raw data is shown as a thin, semi-transparent
    blue line (#306998) with high-frequency fluctuations representing day-to-day temperature
    variations. Overlaid on top is a thick yellow/gold line (#FFD43B) representing
    the 7-day rolling average, which smoothly traces the underlying seasonal trend.
    The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from about -5°C to 25°C, and the x-axis
    shows dates with monthly labels rotated at 30 degrees. A legend in the upper left
    clearly identifies "Daily Temperature" and "7-Day Rolling Average". The title
    follows the required format "line-timeseries-rolling · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    A subtle dashed grid (alpha=0.3) aids in reading values.
