review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual execution with clear explosion effect on the market leader slice
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to build pie chart from scratch in
    plotnine
  - Clean layout with well-proportioned pie and properly positioned custom legend
  - Percentage labels are bold white and readable against colored slices
  - Title follows correct format specification
  - Realistic market share scenario with plausible data
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function (create_pie_segment) which violates the KISS principle
    of no functions/classes
  - Red and green segments could pose mild colorblind accessibility issues
  image_description: 'The plot displays an exploded pie chart showing "Market Share
    by Company" with 6 segments. The largest segment (TechCorp, 32.0%) is exploded/separated
    from the center, rendered in Python blue (#306998). Other segments clockwise from
    TechCorp: DataSoft (24.0%) in yellow, CloudInc (18.0%) in green, NetWorks (12.0%)
    in red, DevHub (8.0%) in purple, and Others (6.0%) in teal. Each slice has a white
    percentage label in bold. A custom legend is positioned to the right showing colored
    squares with company names and percentages. The title "Market Share by Company
    · pie-exploded · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. Clean white
    background with no axes or grid lines.'

        comment: Creative use of plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_polygon
          to manually construct pie segments; demonstrates advanced plotnine usage
          for a chart type not natively supported
