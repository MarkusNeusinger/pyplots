review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format following the required pattern with clear subtitle
  - Three clearly distinguishable clusters using colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow,
    teal)
  - Proper 3D visualization with subtle frame planes providing depth cues
  - All axis labels include units as recommended in the spec
  - Good marker sizing and opacity (radius 14, opacity 0.8) for 150 data points
  - Code is reproducible with np.random.seed(42)
  - Generates both PNG screenshot and interactive HTML output
  - Clean 3D perspective with appropriate alpha/beta angles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning could be improved; currently isolated with significant empty
    space between chart and legend
  - Missing explicit drag-to-rotate interactivity which is a signature Highcharts
    3D feature mentioned in the spec
  - Uses raw JavaScript config rather than highcharts-core Python library, making
    it less maintainable
