review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic clinical trial context with dose-response relationship
  - Creative solution using error bars to represent notch confidence intervals since
    Highcharts lacks native notched box support
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette
  - Proper outlier detection and display
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  weaknesses:
  - Notch visualization uses horizontal error bars rather than the traditional indented
    notch shape, which may confuse users expecting standard notched box plots
  - Contains a helper function (calc_boxplot_stats) which violates the KISS code structure
    requirement
  - Legend placement in upper right corner is somewhat isolated from the chart data
