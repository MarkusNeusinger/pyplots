review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sorting implementation with proper reversal for pygal bottom-to-top
    rendering
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent theming at high resolution
  - Value labels centered in bars with proper currency formatting
  - Horizontal orientation is ideal for category labels as noted in spec
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Missing y-axis title to label the categories dimension
  - Data values could show more variation to better demonstrate sorting benefit
