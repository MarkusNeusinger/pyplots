  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world context using website traffic sources over 24 months
  - Perfect title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Y-axis correctly starts at zero to avoid misleading proportions
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.85) for the stacked areas
  - Legend is well-positioned and non-intrusive
  - Proper ordering of series by size (largest at bottom)
  weaknesses:
  - Series sizes are relatively similar which does not dramatically showcase the stacking
    effect; more variation between categories would better demonstrate how parts contribute
    to whole
  - Axis labels lack units
  - Could benefit from more distinct color separation between adjacent green and purple
    bands for colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing monthly website
    visitors over 24 months (Jan 2023 to Dec 2024). Four traffic source categories
    are stacked: Organic Search (blue, bottom), Direct (yellow), Social Media (green),
    and Referral (purple, top). The y-axis shows Monthly Visitors ranging from 0 to
    approximately 110,000. The title "area-stacked · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top. A legend in the upper left identifies the four categories. The grid
    uses subtle dashed horizontal lines. All areas show realistic growth trends with
    some variation over time.'

        comment: Shows stacking and cumulative totals well, but series sizes are quite
          similar; spec suggests ordering largest at bottom which is done, but more
          variation between series would better demonstrate the stacked nature

        comment: Uses ax.stackplot which is matplotlib's native stacked area function,
          but doesn't leverage more advanced features like color cycling or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
