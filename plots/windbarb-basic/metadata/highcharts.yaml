review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Highcharts windbarb series with proper meteorological
    notation
  - Good variety of wind speeds showing different barb configurations (half-barbs,
    full-barbs)
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean data generation with realistic weather station scenario
  - Provides both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays a circle marker instead of a representative wind barb symbol
  image_description: The plot displays 20 wind barbs positioned across a weather station
    transect on a white background. Each barb consists of a staff pointing in the
    direction from which wind blows, with short barbs (5 knots) and long barbs (10
    knots) attached to indicate wind speed. The barbs are rendered in blue (#306998)
    color. The barbs are positioned vertically at their respective wind speed values
    on the y-axis, creating a pattern that shows higher wind speeds (25-33 knots)
    on the left side (stations 0-8) with multiple barb flags, transitioning to lower
    speeds (3-13 knots) on the right side (stations 12-19) with fewer barb flags.
    The title correctly displays "windbarb-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold,
    with a gray subtitle "Surface Wind Observations from Weather Station Network".
    The x-axis is labeled "Weather Station Index" and the y-axis shows "Wind Speed
    (knots)" with grid lines at 5-knot intervals. A legend at the bottom shows "Surface
    Wind" with a blue circle marker.

          instead of a wind barb symbol which is misleading
