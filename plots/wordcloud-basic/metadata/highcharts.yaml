review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts wordcloud module with proper configuration (archimedean
    spiral, rotation options)
  - 'Colorblind-safe color palette with good variety (#306998, #FFD43B, #9467BD, #17BECF,
    #8C564B, #2CA02C, #E377C2)'
  - Realistic developer survey data with 35 technology terms and appropriate frequency
    weights
  - Title format correctly follows spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated, with HTML using responsive sizing (100% width)
  - Proper inline script embedding for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Good tooltip configuration showing word and mention count
  weaknesses:
  - Code has some redundancy with two separate HTML template generations (inline vs
    CDN versions)
  - Word cloud appears slightly top-heavy in the layout distribution
  - Could benefit from wider weight range for more dramatic size differences between
    common and rare terms
