review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of RSI indicator with all spec requirements met
  - Good use of Highcharts plotBands and plotLines for visual zones
  - Proper RSI calculation with 14-period lookback
  - Data demonstrates meaningful momentum patterns entering both overbought and oversold
    conditions
  - Clean code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Uses red-green color scheme for overbought/oversold zones which is not colorblind-safe;
    should use colorblind-friendly alternatives (e.g., blue/orange or different shades)
  image_description: The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart with a blue line (#306998) showing RSI values oscillating between
    0-100 over 120 trading days (January to April). The chart includes a title "indicator-rsi
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top with subtitle "Relative Strength
    Index (14-period) · Synthetic Stock Data". The Y-axis is labeled "RSI Value" and
    fixed from 0 to 100 with tick intervals of 10. The X-axis is labeled "Date" showing
    2-week tick intervals. A red shaded overbought zone spans 70-100 with "Overbought
    Zone" label and a dashed red line at 70 marked "Overbought (70)". A green shaded
    oversold zone spans 0-30 with "Oversold Zone" label and a dashed green line at
    30 marked "Oversold (30)". A gray dotted centerline at 50 is labeled "Centerline
    (50)". The legend at the bottom shows "RSI (14)". The RSI line demonstrates proper
    momentum behavior, entering overbought territory (>70) around early February and
    April, and oversold territory (<30) around late February/early March.
