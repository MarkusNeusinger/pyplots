review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Realistic business scenario with employee performance data
  - Proper grouped box plot implementation with clear visual distinction between subcategories
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like BoxPlotSeries and proper chart configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function calc_boxplot_stats() which violates the KISS principle
    (no functions/classes rule)
  - Outliers are not displayed as separate points (spec requests outliers to be shown)
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot visualization with 4 department
    categories (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Finance) on the x-axis and Performance
    Score (range 20-100) on the y-axis. Each department contains 3 side-by-side box
    plots colored distinctly: blue (Junior), yellow (Mid-Level), and purple (Senior).
    The title correctly reads "box-grouped · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold black
    text with a gray subtitle "Employee Performance Scores by Department and Experience
    Level". A vertical legend in the top-right identifies the three experience levels.
    All boxes show clear median lines (black), quartile boxes with fill colors matching
    the legend, and whiskers extending to data bounds. The distributions vary meaningfully
    across groups - e.g., Sales Junior has a wide spread down to ~36, while Finance
    Senior reaches up to 100.'
