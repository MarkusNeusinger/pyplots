review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-balanced layout and proportions
  - Correct implementation of count plot with automatic counting from raw data
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic survey response scenario that clearly demonstrates the plot type
  - Count labels positioned outside bars for easy reading
  weaknesses:
  - Could enhance Plotly interactivity with custom hover templates showing percentages
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Count (n) or Frequency)
  - Bar colors could use a gradient or vary by value to better showcase Plotly capabilities
