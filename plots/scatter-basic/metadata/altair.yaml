review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's transform_regression for the trend line — idiomatic
    and avoids manual numpy polyfit for the line itself
  - 'Strong text hierarchy with custom font sizes, colors (#222, #333, #555, #777),
    and subtitle padding'
  - Clean layered composition (points + trend + annotation) using Altair's + operator
  - Correlation annotation (r = 0.92) adds meaningful data storytelling
  - Multi-component data generation (uniform tails + normal center) creates realistic-looking
    scatter distribution
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML with interactivity) leverages Altair's web-native strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could better utilize canvas space — the defined axis domains (1-10.5 x,
    20-105 y) leave empty corners where no data exists
  - Marker size=150 is at the upper boundary for 100 data points; reducing slightly
    could improve clarity in dense regions
  - The r=0.92 annotation positioning relies on a manual calculation offset (+8) that
    could be fragile with different data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart with approximately 100 blue
    filled circle markers (Python Blue #306998) with white edge strokes on a clean
    white background. The x-axis is labeled "Study Hours per Day (hrs)" and ranges
    from 1 to 10. The y-axis is labeled "Exam Score (%)" and ranges from 20 to 100.
    A dashed gray trend line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right, clearly
    showing the positive linear relationship. A bold text annotation "r = 0.92" is
    positioned near the center of the plot. The title "scatter-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed prominently at the top in dark text, with a smaller gray subtitle
    "Positive correlation between daily study hours and exam performance" beneath
    it. The grid uses subtle dashed light gray lines at low opacity. Data points spread
    naturally around the trend line with realistic scatter, clustering denser in the
    4-7 hour range (from the normal distribution component) and sparser at the extremes.'
