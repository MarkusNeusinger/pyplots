review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent R² and equation annotation implementation using separate text marks
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper layering (scatter + curve + annotations)
  - Realistic agricultural scenario (fertilizer vs crop yield) perfectly demonstrates
    diminishing returns
  - 'Good color choices: Python blue (#306998) for points and contrasting yellow (#FFD43B)
    for curve'
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity
  - Proper scale factor (3.0) for PNG export achieving target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines present - adding subtle grid (alpha 0.3) would improve readability
  - Some data points have negative yield values (-1 tons/ha) which is unrealistic
    for crop yield
  - Could use Altair built-in transform_regression() instead of manual numpy polyfit
    for more idiomatic implementation
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with polynomial regression showing
    the relationship between fertilizer application (kg/ha) on the x-axis and crop
    yield (tons/ha) on the y-axis. Blue circular markers (#306998) represent 80 data
    points with 65% opacity, distributed in a clear parabolic pattern. A bold yellow
    polynomial curve (#FFD43B) fits through the data, demonstrating diminishing returns
    - yield increases initially then decreases with excessive fertilizer. The R² value
    (0.805) and polynomial equation (y = -0.75x² + 7.54x + 5.29) are prominently displayed
    in the upper left corner. The title correctly follows the format 'scatter-regression-polynomial
    · altair · pyplots.ai'. Axis labels include units (kg/ha and tons/ha). The overall
    layout is clean with good use of canvas space.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative syntax, layered charts, tooltips, and text

          instead of manual numpy calculation
  verdict: APPROVED
