review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear grayscale qualitative bands that do not distract
    from the primary measure
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling following the specification
  - Realistic sales dashboard scenario with varied performance levels (above/below
    target)
  - Clean implementation showing all required bullet chart components (actual bar,
    target marker, ranges)
  - Good use of Bokeh Label model for metric annotations
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the grayscale bands (poor/satisfactory/good)
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 horizontal bullet charts stacked vertically
    for sales performance metrics: Revenue, Profit, Orders, Customers, and Satisfaction.
    Each bullet chart shows three grayscale background bands (light gray for poor,
    medium gray for satisfactory, dark gray for good range), a blue (#306998) horizontal
    bar representing the actual value, and a thin black vertical marker indicating
    the target. Metric labels appear on the left side in bold dark text, and actual
    values are displayed in blue text to the right of each bar. The title "bullet-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. The x-axis shows "% of Target
    Range" from 0-100, and all elements are well-proportioned with good spacing between
    rows.'
