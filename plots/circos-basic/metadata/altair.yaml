review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex Circos plot using Altair mark_line with
    filled polygons
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct colors
  - Proper use of Bezier curves for smooth ribbon connections
  - Good proportional sizing of segments based on module importance
  - Clean, readable code structure with clear data preparation
  - Tooltips added for interactivity in HTML output
  - Inner track successfully shows varying activity levels
  - Software module dependencies is a realistic, relatable context
  weaknesses:
  - Inner track visual distinction could be improved - it blends with the outer ring
    in some areas
  - Legend does not appear in the static PNG output (may only show in HTML)
  - Segment labels could be larger (16px may be small for 3600px canvas)
  - Some ribbon connections are thin and hard to distinguish when values are small
