review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly heatmap to render QR code matrix
  - Clean code structure with proper quiet zone (border=4)
  - Appropriate square aspect ratio with scaleanchor for 1:1 ratio
  - Good use of annotations to display encoded content and error correction level
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  - High contrast black/white colorscale for maximum scanability
  weaknesses:
  - Annotation text font sizes (28pt, 24pt) are on the smaller side relative to 3600px
    canvas
  - Could use slightly tighter margins to make QR code larger on canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a QR code encoding "https://pyplots.ai" rendered
    as a black and white square matrix barcode. The QR code features the standard
    three finder patterns (large squares) in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left
    corners. The title "qrcode-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    blue (#306998) color. Below the QR code, two annotation lines display: "Content:
    https://pyplots.ai" in gray and "Error Correction: M (15%)" in lighter gray. The
    QR code is centered on a white background with adequate quiet zone (white border)
    around it. The overall layout is square (3600×3600 px).'
