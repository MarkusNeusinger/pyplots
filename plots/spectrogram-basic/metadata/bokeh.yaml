review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform and colorblind-accessible
    visualization
  - Clean implementation with proper dB scale conversion for power spectral density
  - Clear chirp signal demonstrates time-frequency analysis effectively
  - Proper scipy.signal integration for spectrogram computation
  - Well-sized text for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines (dashed) are somewhat distracting over the heatmap image; consider
    disabling or reducing opacity
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive hover tools to show frequency/time/power values
  image_description: The plot displays a spectrogram showing a chirp signal with frequency
    increasing linearly from approximately 200 Hz to 2000 Hz over 2 seconds. The bright
    yellow diagonal line represents the high-power chirp signal against a blue-green
    noisy background rendered with the viridis colormap. The x-axis shows "Time (seconds)"
    from 0 to ~2, the y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" from 0 to ~4000 Hz. A colorbar
    on the right indicates "Power (dB)" ranging from approximately -80 to -20 dB.
    The title correctly reads "spectrogram-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai".
