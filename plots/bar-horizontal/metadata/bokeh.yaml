review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of real-world data (programming language popularity) that resonates
    with the target audience
  - Proper sorting from smallest to largest for intuitive bottom-to-top reading
  - 'Good use of bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource for data management, categorical
    y_range, dual PNG/HTML output'
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that do not distract from the data
  weaknesses:
  - Some unused canvas space on the right side could be better utilized
  - Y-axis label is missing (could add Programming Language label for completeness)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing "Top Programming
    Languages by Developer Popularity (%)" with 10 programming languages. The bars
    are rendered in a consistent steel blue color (#306998) with a darker border.
    Languages are sorted from bottom (Kotlin at 9.2%) to top (JavaScript at 65.6%),
    creating a clear visual ranking. The title "bar-horizontal · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Developer Popularity (%)" with
    a range from 0 to 70. Category labels (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Java, C#,
    C++, PHP, Go, Rust, Kotlin) appear on the y-axis. The grid lines are subtle and
    dashed, appearing only on the x-axis. The overall layout is clean with good spacing
    between bars.
