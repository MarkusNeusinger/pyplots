review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all biplot components: scores, loadings, and proper
    labeling'
  - Smart use of custom label offsets to prevent text overlap with loading arrows
  - Good color palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Proper variance explained percentages in axis labels
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with scaled font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned outside the plot area to avoid any potential overlap
    with data
  - Loading arrow scaling could be slightly adjusted for better visual balance with
    score points
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot using the Iris dataset with 150
    data points distributed across three species groups. The scatter points are colored
    by species: blue (Python Blue #306998) for setosa clustered on the left side,
    yellow (#FFD43B) for versicolor in the middle, and green (#4CAF50) for virginica
    on the right. Four red loading arrows originate from the origin (0,0), representing
    the four Iris features: sepal width points upward-left, sepal length points toward
    the upper-right, petal width points toward the right at a slight upward angle,
    and petal length points horizontally to the right. Each arrow is labeled in red
    text with the feature name. The title "biplot-pca · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top-left. Axis labels show "PC1 (73.0%)" and "PC2 (22.9%)" with variance
    explained percentages. A legend in the upper-left shows the three species. Dashed
    gray reference lines cross at the origin. The background is light gray (#FAFAFA)
    with subtle dashed grid lines.'
