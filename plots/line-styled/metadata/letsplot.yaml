review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, longdash)
    as specified
  - Perfect title format following the {spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai convention
  - 'Strong accessibility: combining color AND line style ensures print/colorblind
    friendliness'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic climate zone temperature data that makes intuitive sense
  - Well-sized text elements (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt ticks) appropriate for
    4800×2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in code specifies color=Climate Zone and linetype=Climate Zone but the
    data column is Station - while it works, the column naming is inconsistent
  - All four climate zones follow the same basic seasonal pattern (low in winter,
    high in summer) - could show more variation (e.g., Southern Hemisphere climate
    with inverse pattern)
  image_description: 'The plot displays four line series representing monthly temperature
    readings for different climate zones (Coastal, Continental, Mountain, Mediterranean)
    over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The title "line-styled · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold black text. The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from
    -8 to 30, and the X-axis shows "Month" with abbreviated month names. Each series
    uses a distinct color AND line style: Coastal (solid blue #306998), Continental
    (dashed yellow #FFD43B), Mountain (dotted red #DC2626), and Mediterranean (long-dash
    green #22C55E). Points are marked at each data value with matching colors. A legend
    titled "Climate Zone" is positioned on the right side with both color and line
    style indicators. The grid is subtle gray with minor gridlines visible.'

        comment: Grid is somewhat visible (major at 0.5, minor at 0.3) but the legend
          title says "Climate Zone" while code labels say "Station" in legend_title
          - minor mismatch, but the legend shows both color and linetype which is
          correct

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_line, geom_point, scale_linetype_manual,
          scale_color_manual, theme customization. Good use of lets-plot's ggplot2-style
          API but nothing uniquely distinctive to lets-plot specifically (e.g., could
          use tooltip for interactivity)
  verdict: APPROVED
