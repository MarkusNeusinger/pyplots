review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data generation with mixture of two normals — perfectly demonstrates
    histogram capabilities
  - Strong data storytelling with mean/median reference lines, annotations, and bimodal
    callout label
  - All font sizes explicitly set matching library guide recommendations (24/20/16/14pt)
  - Clean grammar-of-graphics composition with idiomatic plotnine patterns (after_stat,
    annotate label)
  - Well-calibrated bin count (30 for 500 points) with clear edge colors for bin boundary
    definition
  weaknesses:
  - DE-01 could be improved with more distinctive color treatment or typography refinement
    to reach publication-quality
  - The bimodal distribution annotation label text is relatively small compared to
    the mean/median annotations — could benefit from slightly larger size for better
    visual hierarchy
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of test scores (0–100 scale) rendered
    with blue (#306998) bars with dark blue (#1a3a5c) edges, creating clear bin boundaries.
    The distribution is visibly bimodal with two peaks — one around scores 45–48 and
    another around 78–80 — separated by a valley near 55–65. An orange solid vertical
    line marks the median at 57.9, and a red dashed vertical line marks the mean at
    60.8. Both statistics are annotated with bold colored text positioned above the
    valley. A small gray-on-light-gray label box in the upper right reads "Bimodal
    distribution: two student clusters." The title "histogram-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is bold at the top. X-axis reads "Test Score (points)" and Y-axis reads "Frequency
    (count)", both with explicit sizing. Y-axis starts at 0. Background is clean white
    with only subtle horizontal gridlines. Overall layout is well-balanced in 16:9
    aspect ratio.'
