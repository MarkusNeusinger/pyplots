review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/purple) for clear species
    differentiation
  - Proper symmetric scatter matrix layout with histograms on diagonal showing distributions
  - Clean 3600×3600 square canvas appropriate for matrix visualization
  - Good use of Iris dataset with realistic variable names and units
  - Species clustering clearly visible especially in petal measurements
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha 0.2-0.3 instead of #e0e0e0)'
  - Bottom-row x-axis tick labels are partially cut off/difficult to read
  - Uses raw Highcharts JS generation instead of highcharts-core Python library
