review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with appropriate pygal idioms
  - Excellent realistic meteorological data showing dominant westerly/NW wind pattern
  - Good use of blue sequential color palette that is colorblind-friendly
  - Well-configured legend placement and appropriate canvas sizing
  - Title follows required pyplots.ai format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Radar chart with filled areas is not a true polar bar chart (bars radiating outward);
    this is a limitation of pygal which lacks a dedicated polar bar chart type
  - No axis title labels explaining what the radial scale represents (e.g., Frequency
    (%))
