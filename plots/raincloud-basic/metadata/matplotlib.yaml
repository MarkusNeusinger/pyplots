review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three raincloud components (half-violin, box plot,
    jittered points)
  - Manual KDE calculation with Silverman's rule shows strong understanding of the
    visualization
  - Clean visual separation between components with appropriate offsets
  - Realistic reaction time data scenario with meaningful group differences
  - Professional styling with clean spines, subtle grid, and well-sized fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned outside the plot area to avoid any potential overlap
    with data
  - Scatter point size (s=80) is slightly small for the data density; s=100-120 would
    improve visibility
  - The bimodal distribution in Treatment A is not very visible in the violin - could
    use more separation between modes
