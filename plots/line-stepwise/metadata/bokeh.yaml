review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step line implementation with manual coordinate transformation for post
    step style
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic CPU usage scenario that naturally demonstrates stepwise behavior
  - Good visual clarity with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use Bokeh native step line mode (line with step_mode parameter) which
    would be more idiomatic
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance the interactive HTML version
  - Markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at the target resolution
  - Small random noise in data slightly contradicts the discrete state changes concept
    from the spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a step line chart showing CPU Usage (%) over
    24 hours (Hour of Day). The chart uses a blue color (#306998) for both the step
    line and circular markers at each data point. The title "line-stepwise · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The X-axis is labeled "Hour of Day"
    (ranging 0-23), and the Y-axis is labeled "CPU Usage (%)" (ranging 0-100). The
    step pattern clearly shows horizontal segments where values remain constant, with
    vertical transitions at each hour mark. The background is a light gray (#fafafa)
    with dashed grid lines. Data points show a realistic CPU usage pattern: lower
    usage in early morning hours (~20-35%), rising during work hours (~75-95%), with
    peaks around hours 5-6 and 14-15.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource appropriately, figure configuration, and both
          PNG and HTML export. However, doesn't leverage Bokeh's built-in step line
          mode or HoverTool for interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
