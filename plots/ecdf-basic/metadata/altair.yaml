review:
  strengths:
  - Correct ECDF implementation with proper step-after interpolation
  - Excellent text sizing (title 28pt, labels 22pt, ticks 18pt) for high readability
  - Proper Y-axis scale fixed to 0-1 range as required by spec
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principles
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax with proper encoding types
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha 0.3, dashed) aids percentile reading without being
    distracting
  - Appropriate data size (200 points) for ECDF visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could be "Value (units)" instead of just "Value")
  - Data uses generic normal distribution rather than a real-world scenario context
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like interactive selections or layered
    annotations
