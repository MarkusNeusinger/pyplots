review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of ggbunch() for mosaic layouts with non-uniform panel
    sizes
  - Good variety of plot types (area, bar, scatter with regression, histogram, line,
    heatmap)
  - 'Consistent color scheme (Python blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B) across all panels'
  - Clear visual hierarchy with larger overview panel at top
  - Text labels with units (Revenue ($), Effort (hours), Growth Rate (%))
  - Bimodal histogram shows data variation effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines on most subplots would improve data readability
  - Heatmap decimal precision (e.g., 74.5708) is excessive - should round to whole
    numbers or 1 decimal
  - X-axis labels on bar chart are angled at 30° but could benefit from slightly more
    rotation or shorter labels to improve readability
