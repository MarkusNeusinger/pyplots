review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast with adaptive white/black text based on background intensity
  - Row-normalized percentages provide additional insight beyond raw counts
  - Realistic multi-class classification scenario with plausible confusion patterns
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Square aspect ratio perfect for symmetric confusion matrix
  - Professional colorbar with clear Count label
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage matplotlib-specific advanced features (just uses basic imshow)
  - Grid lines at width=2 are slightly prominent compared to subtle alpha=0.3 guidelines
