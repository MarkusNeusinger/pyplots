review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with proper encoding types (:N,
    :Q)
  - Perfect implementation of 100% stacking using stack="normalize"
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual contrast between segments
  - Real-world energy mix data scenario that perfectly demonstrates proportional comparison
  - Clean segment separation with white strokes improves readability
  - Interactive tooltips enhance data exploration
  - Consistent component ordering across all bars
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label "Share of Energy Mix" could include explicit unit notation like "(%)"
    even though format shows percentages
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing energy mix
    composition by country (Brazil, China, Germany, India, USA). Each bar is normalized
    to 100% and divided into four colored segments: Fossil Fuels (dark blue #306998),
    Nuclear (yellow #FFD43B), Renewables (green #2ca02c), and Hydro (cyan #17becf).
    The x-axis shows country names with horizontal labels, the y-axis shows percentage
    from 0% to 100% labeled "Share of Energy Mix". The title "bar-stacked-percent
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend on the right identifies
    each energy source. White strokes separate bar segments. Brazil notably shows
    ~70% hydro (cyan), while India shows ~72% fossil fuels (blue). Germany shows the
    highest renewables share (~38%).'
