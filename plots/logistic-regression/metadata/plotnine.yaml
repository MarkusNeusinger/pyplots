review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the logistic regression specification with all required
    elements
  - Clean grammar of graphics composition using plotnine idioms (layered geoms, aesthetic
    mappings)
  - Proper use of statsmodels for logistic regression fitting with confidence intervals
  - Good data generation with realistic exam score scenario including noise for authenticity
  - Appropriate font scaling for high-resolution output (4800x2700 canvas)
  - Decision threshold line at p=0.5 clearly visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Exam Score (points)" though score may not need
    units)
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (lower alpha)
  - Library features score limited - uses standard plotnine without advanced features
    like faceting or stat layers
  image_description: The plot displays a logistic regression visualization with the
    characteristic S-shaped (sigmoid) probability curve. It shows a blue logistic
    curve (solid line, ~2px width) representing predicted probabilities from exam
    score 20 to 100. A light blue semi-transparent confidence interval band (95% CI)
    surrounds the curve. Red/coral data points are jittered near y≈0 representing
    "Fail" outcomes, while green data points are jittered near y≈1 representing "Pass"
    outcomes. A horizontal dashed gray line at probability = 0.5 indicates the decision
    threshold. The x-axis is labeled "Exam Score" (range 20-100) and the y-axis "Probability
    of Passing" (range 0-1). The title follows the correct format "logistic-regression
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right shows "Outcome" with Fail (red)
    and Pass (green) categories. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle grid
    lines.

        comment: Uses plotnine grammar of graphics well (ggplot, aes, geom_ribbon,
          geom_line, geom_point, position_jitter, scale_color_manual, theme_minimal);
          standard usage but no advanced plotnine-specific features
