review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three meaningful annotation callouts (Top Performer,
    Widest Spread, Outlier count) that guide the viewer through the data
  - 'Strong visual polish: custom color palette with semi-transparent fills, bold
    median lines, styled stems/whiskers, dotted grid, removed axis chrome'
  - 'All spec requirements fully met: median lines, outliers as points, 1.5xIQR whiskers,
    distinct colors per category'
  - Realistic and neutral data scenario (department performance scores) with varied
    distributions
  - Uses Highcharts-specific renderer for rich HTML annotations — a distinctive library
    feature
  weaknesses:
  - Bypasses the highcharts-core Python API in favor of raw JS string construction,
    reducing idiomatic library usage
  - Layout has excess right margin (~280px) creating wasted canvas space; the annotation
    boxes crowd the upper-right area
  - The Top Performer and Widest Spread annotations are positioned close together
    near Design/Finance, creating visual density in one area while leaving other areas
    empty
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots on a light gray (#fafafa)
    background, one for each department: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales
    (purple), Design (cyan), and Finance (brown). The title "box-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is bold and large at the top, with a subtitle "Annual Performance
    Review Scores by Department" in lighter gray. The Y-axis is labeled "Score (out
    of 100)" with dotted grid lines at intervals of 5, ranging from about 35 to 105.
    The X-axis is labeled "Department" with all 5 category labels clearly visible.
    Each box has a bold dark median line, semi-transparent colored fill (alpha ~0.72),
    and colored borders. Whiskers extend with solid gray stems. Red circular outlier
    markers (5 total) are visible — one below Engineering (~58), one above Marketing
    (~100), one above Sales (~100), one below Design (~59), and potentially one more.
    Three annotation callout boxes are present: a green-bordered "Top Performer" box
    near Design noting Median: 81, an orange-bordered "Widest Spread" box near Finance
    noting IQR: 21 pts, and a red-bordered "5 outliers detected" box in the bottom-left.
    The boxes are wide and well-spaced across the chart area.'
