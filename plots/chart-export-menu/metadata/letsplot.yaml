review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggtb() toolbar for built-in export functionality
  - Clean, minimal visual design with appropriate text sizing
  - Realistic sales data scenario with good feature coverage
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics API
  - HTML export provides interactive version with export options
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses letsplot instead of lets-plot per library naming convention
  - Grid styling could be more subtle with explicit alpha value
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly
  image_description: The plot shows a multi-series line chart displaying monthly sales
    data for three categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods) over 12 months (Jan-Dec).
    Electronics is shown in blue, Clothing in yellow/gold, and Home Goods in red.
    Each data series is represented by connected lines with circular markers at data
    points. The chart has a clean minimal design with a subtle beige/cream grid background.
    The title "chart-export-menu · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Y-axis
    shows "Sales (thousands)" ranging from 150-850, and X-axis shows months. A legend
    on the right side identifies the three categories. The plot demonstrates lets-plot's
    built-in export functionality via ggtb() toolbar which enables PNG and SVG export
    options in the interactive HTML version.
