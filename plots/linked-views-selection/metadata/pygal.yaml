review:
  strengths:
  - Clear selection highlighting with consistent blue/gray color scheme
  - Good use of pygal multiple chart types (XY, Histogram, Bar, Pie)
  - Creates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Includes selection count and summary statistics
  - Code structure is well-organized with custom styles
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: PNG output only shows 1 of 4 views - the PIL image composition failed
    to produce the multi-view dashboard'
  - The combined image approach using PIL is fragile and produced incorrect output
  - Individual chart dimensions (2400x1350) do not properly scale into the 4800x2700
    combined image
  - Font loading with try/except may cause inconsistent rendering across environments
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a single scatter plot titled "linked-views-selection · pygal · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Scatter Plot with Selection: 50 of 150 points (Cluster B highlighted)". The plot displays X Coordinate (1-7) on the horizontal axis and Y Coordinate (1-8) on the vertical axis. Gray dots represent unselected points (100 pts) clustered in the lower-left region (around x=1-4, y=1-4), while blue dots represent selected Cluster B points (50 pts) clustered in the upper-right region (around x=5-7, y=5-8). A subtle dotted grid is visible. The legend at the bottom shows "Unselected (100 pts)" in gray and "Selected: Cluster B (50 pts)" in blue.

    CRITICAL ISSUE: The image only shows ONE view (scatter plot), but the code creates a 2x2 grid with 4 views. The combined image composition using PIL appears to have failed - only the scatter plot is visible instead of the full multi-view dashboard with scatter, histogram, bar chart, and pie chart summary.
