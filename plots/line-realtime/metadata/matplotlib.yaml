review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of sliding window concept with fade effect on older data
  - Creative gradient fill technique using layered fill_between calls
  - Prominent current value indicator with yellow badge is highly visible
  - Clear scroll direction arrow with text annotation
  - Warning threshold line adds practical monitoring context
  - Realistic CPU usage data pattern with sinusoidal base and random spikes
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend entry for the warning threshold line (just has text label "Warning")
  - The gradient effect on the line itself (segment-by-segment plotting) could be
    smoother
