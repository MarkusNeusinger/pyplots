review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of step chart using point duplication technique since
    pygal lacks native step chart support
  - Excellent choice of cumulative monthly sales data that perfectly demonstrates
    step plot use case
  - Clean, readable code with appropriate font sizing for the large canvas
  - Proper use of node radius control to show/hide intermediate points
  - Good color choice with accessible blue palette
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is too small/faint and hard to read
  - Line stroke width could be increased for better visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - The step implementation, while clever, results in empty x-axis labels for intermediate
    points which may cause spacing issues
