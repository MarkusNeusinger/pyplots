review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents overlap
  - Clean implementation of timeline using ggplot grammar (geom_segment + geom_point
    + geom_text)
  - Good color palette with 5 distinct phases clearly differentiated
  - Realistic software project milestone data that is easy to understand
  - Proper title format and legend placement
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Red and green colors for Testing and Development could be improved for colorblind
    accessibility
  - Event label text size (size=9) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - X-axis label 2024 is unconventional - consider moving year to title or using a
    more descriptive label
