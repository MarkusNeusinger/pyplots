review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using Altair's declarative layering (background_circles,
    outline_circles, counts_layer, names_layer)
  - Proportional circle sizing based on set sizes using math.sqrt scaling
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - All seven regions correctly labeled with accurate calculations
  - Transparent fills (opacity=0.35) clearly show overlapping regions
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizes for legibility
  weaknesses:
  - Diagram is positioned in upper portion of canvas with significant empty whitespace
    below (~40% of canvas unused)
  - Set label positions are hardcoded with magic numbers rather than computed relative
    to circles
  - Circle arrangement is unconventional (smallest set at top rather than traditional
    triangular arrangement)
