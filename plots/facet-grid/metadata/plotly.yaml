review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using Plotly Express native faceting capability (facet_row,
    facet_col)
  - Excellent data generation with realistic business scenario (marketing spend vs
    sales by region and quarter)
  - Good visual hierarchy with clear title, readable axis labels with units, and subtle
    grid
  - Produces both PNG and HTML output leveraging Plotly interactivity
  - Proper use of template=plotly_white for clean appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend showing regions is redundant since region is already encoded by facet rows
  - Markers could be slightly larger (15-18 instead of 12) for better visibility with
    ~15 points per facet
  - Row facet labels are displayed vertically which reduces readability compared to
    horizontal text
  image_description: The plot displays a 4×4 faceted grid layout showing the relationship
    between Marketing Spend ($K) and Sales ($K). The columns represent quarters (Q1,
    Q2, Q3, Q4) and the rows represent regions (North, South, East, West). Each subplot
    contains approximately 15 scatter points. The color scheme uses blue (#306998)
    for all data points consistently across all facets. A legend appears on the right
    side showing region colors (North=blue, South=yellow, East=blue, West=yellow),
    though this appears to be an artifact from Plotly's automatic color mapping rather
    than the code's explicit single-color setting. The row labels are displayed vertically
    on the right side in format "Region=North", etc. Column labels at the top show
    "Quarter=Q1", etc. The main title "facet-grid · plotly · pyplots.ai" is prominently
    displayed at the top center. Axes show Marketing Spend ($K) on x-axis (10-50 range)
    and Sales ($K) on y-axis (60-140 range). Grid lines are subtle with light gray
    color.

          legend takes some space redundantly

        comment: Uses px.scatter with facet_row/facet_col which is Plotly Express's
          strength; also outputs HTML for interactivity; could leverage more Plotly
          features like hover data or trendlines
  verdict: APPROVED
