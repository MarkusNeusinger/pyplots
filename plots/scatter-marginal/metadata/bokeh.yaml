review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent axis alignment between scatter and marginal plots using shared x_range/y_range
  - Clean visual design with Python blue/yellow color scheme that is colorblind-safe
  - Well-proportioned layout with marginals at ~20% of dimensions
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) for scatter points revealing density patterns
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha=0.3, dashed) that does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or meaningful context
  - Scatter point size (18) could be slightly larger for better visibility on this
    canvas
  - Empty corner placeholder could be utilized for annotation or removed more elegantly
