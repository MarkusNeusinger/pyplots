review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of bimodal height data showing male/female distributions - demonstrates
    histogram capabilities well
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  - Good visual balance with appropriate bin count (30 bins for 600 data points)
  - White bar borders create clear bin separation as specified
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines despite theme_minimal() - could add subtle grid for easier
    frequency reading
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like interactive tooltips or
    custom scales
  image_description: 'The plot shows a histogram of height data in centimeters (x-axis:
    140-205 cm, y-axis: Frequency 0-60). The bars are filled with a blue color (#306998)
    with white borders. The distribution shows a slight bimodality with peaks around
    165 cm and 178 cm, representing combined male and female height distributions.
    The title "histogram-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The
    plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gridlines on a white background. All text
    is clearly readable, and the layout is well-balanced with good proportions.'
