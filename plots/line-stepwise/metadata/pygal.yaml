review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step visualization achieved through clever data point duplication for
    horizontal-then-vertical transitions
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate Python Blue color scheme
  - Realistic server response time scenario that clearly demonstrates discrete state
    changes
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Manual step data construction is verbose; pygal native line interpolation options
    could be explored
  - Right margin has slight excess whitespace
  - Grid only shows Y-axis guides; X-axis guides could improve readability of hour
    markers
