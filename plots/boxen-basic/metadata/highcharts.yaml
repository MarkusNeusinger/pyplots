review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of boxen plot using columnrange series with varying pointWidth
    for the nested box effect
  - Excellent data scenario with realistic server response time distributions showing
    different characteristics per endpoint
  - Proper use of Highcharts-more.js for columnrange functionality
  - Well-designed color gradient (Python blue shades) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Clear legend explaining all quantile levels
  - Good use of custom tooltip formatter for context-aware hover information
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function calculate_letter_values() which should be inline code
    per KISS principle
  - Legend percentages could be confusing - spec mentions eighths/sixteenths terminology
  image_description: 'The plot displays a boxen (letter-value) plot showing server
    response times across four service endpoints: API Gateway, Auth Service, Database,
    and Cache Layer. The visualization uses nested columnrange bars in shades of blue
    (from dark navy #1a3d5c to light #b5d4eb) to represent different quantile levels.
    Each category shows progressively narrower boxes representing deeper quantiles.
    Yellow diamond markers indicate the median values. Red circular markers show outliers.
    The title "boxen-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    explaining the data context. The Y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from
    0 to ~430ms. A vertical legend on the right side lists all quantile levels (Median
    ± 25%, 37.5%, 43.75%, 46.875%, 48.4%), Median, and Outliers.'
