review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lift curve with correct mathematical calculation
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics (ggplot, geom_line, geom_point, geom_hline)
  - Good visual distinction with yellow-filled decile markers on blue line
  - Proper reference line at y=1 for random selection baseline
  - Well-documented code with realistic customer response scenario
  - Appropriate sizing for high-resolution output (16x9, 300 DPI)
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include (ratio) for clarity since lift is a unitless ratio
  - Could add text annotations at key decile points showing actual lift values
