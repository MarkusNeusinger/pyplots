review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent financial data simulation with mixture of normal, volatile, and extreme
    return periods creating realistic fat-tailed distribution
  - Manual KDE implementation using Scott's rule bandwidth is mathematically correct
    and educational
  - Perfect color contrast between blue histogram and yellow KDE line - colorblind
    accessible
  - 'All spec requirements met: semi-transparent bars (alpha=0.5), density scaling,
    KDE overlay, contrasting colors'
  - Professional appearance suitable for publication with proper axis labels including
    units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid legend styling could be slightly improved (legend box frame could have subtle
    background)
  - Manual KDE implementation, while correct, does not leverage scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
    which would be more robust
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)
    overlay showing daily stock returns as percentages. The histogram bars are rendered
    in a muted blue color (#306998) with semi-transparency (alpha ~0.5) and darker
    blue edges. A smooth yellow/gold KDE curve (#FFD43B) overlays the histogram with
    a thick linewidth, clearly visible against the bars. The x-axis is labeled "Daily
    Return (%)" ranging from approximately -10% to +10%, and the y-axis shows "Density"
    from 0.00 to ~0.26. The title follows the correct format "histogram-kde · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper right clearly identifies "Histogram" and
    "KDE". The distribution shows a roughly normal shape centered near 0, with some
    fat tails extending to extreme values, consistent with realistic financial return
    data. The plot has a subtle dashed grid.

        comment: Manual KDE implementation is educational but could have used scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
          or seaborn's kdeplot for more robust estimation. The manual implementation
          using Scott's rule is correct and demonstrates understanding.
  verdict: APPROVED
