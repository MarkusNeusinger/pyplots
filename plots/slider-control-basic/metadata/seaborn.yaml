review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of slider interactivity using matplotlib.widgets.Slider
    with seaborn bar plot
  - Clean data generation with realistic seasonal sales patterns and year-over-year
    growth
  - Value labels above each bar provide excellent data readability
  - Proper font sizing throughout (24pt title, 20pt axis labels, 16pt ticks, 18pt
    slider labels)
  - Y-axis formatted with dollar signs and K notation for clarity
  - Instructional text helps users understand the interactive functionality
  - Good use of seaborn whitegrid style for professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend score slightly reduced as whitegrid could be more subtle for a bar
    chart
  - Layout has extra bottom margin for slider which slightly reduces plot area proportion
