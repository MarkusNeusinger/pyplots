review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of parliament seats in semicircular arcs
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color distinction between parties
  - Legend clearly shows party names with seat counts
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Neutral fictional party names avoid political controversy
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  - Clean use of Highcharts scatter series for individual seats
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a helper function calculate_seat_positions instead of inline code (violates
    KISS structure requirement)
