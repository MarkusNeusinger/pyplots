review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of seaborn heatmap to simulate icicle chart structure
  - Clean Blues_r color palette clearly distinguishes hierarchy levels
  - Good label truncation logic prevents text overflow
  - Informative legend explaining hierarchy levels
  - Realistic file system data with plausible sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text instead of exact spec format "{spec-id}
    · {library} · pyplots.ai"
  - Does not display values/sizes on rectangles (spec mentions size represents its
    value)
  - Seaborn is being used minimally (only heatmap + styling) - implementation is mostly
    matplotlib
  - Some truncated labels lose important information (e.g., Documents becomes Docume..)
