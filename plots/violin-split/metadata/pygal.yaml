review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation of split violins using pygal XY chart with filled
    polygons
  - Clear visual distinction between Before (blue) and After (yellow) groups
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (patient recovery scores) that makes the comparison
    meaningful
  - Proper use of KDE for smooth density estimation
  - Quartile markers (IQR lines and median) add statistical information
  - Clean legend placement at bottom with appropriate column layout
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced proportions
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function (compute_kde) which violates KISS principle -
    should inline the KDE computation or restructure
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., Recovery Score 0-100)
