review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of voter migration with smooth bezier curves connecting
    nodes
  - Well-organized layout with party labels on both left and right sides including
    vote counts
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.4) for overlapping flows to maintain readability
  - Realistic and compelling data scenario using U.S. election data across multiple
    cycles
  - Proper use of Bokeh patches for complex polygon shapes
  - Creates both PNG and HTML outputs as expected for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Title ordering has subtitle appearing above main title (should be reversed)
  - Party name labels at 18pt could be increased to 20-22pt for better readability
    at full resolution
  - Could add tooltips or hover effects in the HTML version to show exact flow values
