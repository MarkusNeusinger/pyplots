quality_score: 90
review:
  strengths:
  - Correct RSI calculation using EMA method with 14-period lookback
  - All required threshold lines (30, 50, 70) clearly visible with appropriate styling
  - RSI enters both overbought and oversold zones demonstrating full indicator range
  - Good color differentiation between RSI line and threshold lines
  - Clean canvas utilization with proper margins
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom takes significant vertical space; could be more compact
  - No shading/highlighting of overbought (70-100) and oversold (0-30) zones as suggested
    in spec (pygal limitation)
  - X-axis labels hidden (show_x_labels=False) - could show periodic date markers
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart on a white background. A blue line (RSI 14-period) smoothly oscillates
    across 120 trading days, reaching peaks above 90 (overbought territory) twice
    and dropping below 15 (deeply oversold) twice. Three horizontal threshold lines
    are clearly visible: a red dashed line at 70 (overbought), a green dashed line
    at 30 (oversold), and a gray dotted line at 50 (centerline). The Y-axis is correctly
    fixed from 0 to 100 with clear labels. The X-axis title indicates "Trading Period
    (120 days, 14-period RSI lookback)". The title follows the correct format "indicator-rsi
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". A legend at the bottom identifies all four series. The
    layout shows good canvas utilization with the plot area filling most of the available
    space.'

        comment: Uses pygal Style customization, stroke_style for dashed lines, interpolate=cubic
          for smooth curves, legend_at_bottom. Could leverage more pygal-specific
          features like tooltips.
