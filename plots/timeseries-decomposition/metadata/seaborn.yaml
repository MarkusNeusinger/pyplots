review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent four-panel layout perfectly matching the specification requirements
  - Manual decomposition implementation is educational and shows clear understanding
    of the concept
  - Color palette is distinctive and colorblind-friendly with good contrast between
    components
  - Realistic airline passenger data scenario with appropriate 10-year monthly timespan
  - Zero-reference lines on Seasonal and Residual panels aid interpretation
  - Clean KISS-style code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels for Trend, Seasonal, and Residual subplots could include units or
    clearer descriptions
  - Uses basic sns.lineplot rather than leveraging more distinctive seaborn features
    like FacetGrid or relplot
