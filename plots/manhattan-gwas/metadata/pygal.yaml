review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating blue/gray color scheme for chromosome distinction that is
    colorblind-friendly
  - Both genome-wide significance (p=5×10⁻⁸) and suggestive (p=1×10⁻⁵) threshold lines
    are clearly visible
  - Good use of pygal's tooltip system with informative labels showing chromosome,
    position, and p-value
  - Significant SNPs are properly highlighted in red as a separate series
  - Clean chromosome labeling at midpoints with all 22 chromosomes visible
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (format_x_label) which violates the KISS principle
    requiring flat script structure
  - Data point markers are somewhat small for the 11,000+ point dataset; larger dots_size
    would improve visibility
  - Legend at bottom takes substantial vertical space; could be more compact
