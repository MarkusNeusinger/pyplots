review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, correct ECDF implementation with proper step function using where="post"
  - Excellent text sizing and readability following matplotlib guidelines exactly
  - Helpful quartile reference lines (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) that add value for reading
    percentiles
  - Colorblind-safe color choices with good contrast
  - Follows KISS structure perfectly with clean, readable code
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label "Value" is generic and lacks units (could be more descriptive)
  - Data scenario is generic random samples rather than a real-world context (e.g.,
    test scores, response times)
  - Does not use matplotlib.pyplot.ecdf (available since 3.8) which would demonstrate
    matplotlib-specific functionality
  image_description: The plot displays a blue step function (ECDF curve) showing the
    cumulative distribution of 200 random normal samples. The x-axis is labeled "Value"
    ranging from approximately 10 to 90, and the y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion"
    ranging from 0 to 1.0. Three yellow dotted horizontal reference lines mark the
    quartile positions at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. The title correctly reads "ecdf-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. The line width is appropriately thick (linewidth=3),
    and the plot uses a subtle gray dashed grid for readability. The overall color
    scheme is colorblind-safe with blue (#306998) for the main data and yellow (#FFD43B)
    for the reference lines.

        comment: Basic matplotlib usage with ax.step(); could use matplotlib's built-in
          ecdf from stats module (matplotlib 3.8+) or demonstrate more advanced matplotlib
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
