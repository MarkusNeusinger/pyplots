review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using plotnine grammar of graphics (segments + points
    + text) for network visualization
  - Excellent realistic data scenario (software company org chart with 30 employees)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors and node sizes per level
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - Label crowding at bottom level where 18 team members are positioned horizontally
  - Some label text overlaps slightly, particularly in dense areas
  - Legend could have better spacing from the bottom edge
  - Random seed is set but not actually used since all data is hardcoded
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart representing
    a software company with 30 employees across 4 management levels. At the top is
    a single large dark blue node labeled "CEO" (Level 0). Below are three yellow
    nodes representing VPs (Level 1: VP Engineering, VP Product, VP Operations). The
    third level shows 8 teal/cyan nodes for Directors and Managers (Level 2). The
    bottom level displays 18 smaller coral/salmon-colored nodes for team members (Level
    3). Gray straight lines connect parent nodes to their children, clearly showing
    reporting relationships. Node sizes decrease with hierarchy level. The title "network-hierarchical
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A horizontal legend at the
    bottom identifies each level by color. The layout uses a white background with
    no grid or axes visible.'
