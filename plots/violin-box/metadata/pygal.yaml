review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using XY chart to create violin shapes
  - White-filled box plots provide good contrast against colored violins
  - 'Proper statistical elements: IQR box, median, whiskers with caps, outliers'
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is cluttered with many empty entries and technical component names that
    appear repetitive
  - Performance scores slightly exceed the 0-100 scale implied by the axis label
  - Outlier dots could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
