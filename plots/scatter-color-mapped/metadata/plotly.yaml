review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap with clear colorbar labeling including units
  - Realistic geographic/temperature scenario that demonstrates the color-mapping
    concept well
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good font sizing throughout (title 28pt, labels 22pt, ticks 18pt) for large canvas
  - White marker borders enhance point visibility against the colorful background
  - Interactive HTML output alongside PNG leverages Plotly core strength
  weaknesses:
  - Hovertemplate is good but could include more Plotly-specific features like custom
    colorbar ticks or range sliders
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is acceptable but could be slightly more subtle (0.2) for a
    cleaner look
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 150 data points showing
    temperature readings across US geographic coordinates. The x-axis shows Longitude
    (°W) ranging from -120 to -70, and the y-axis shows Latitude (°N) ranging from
    approximately 25 to 50. Each point is colored using the Viridis colormap, mapping
    temperature values from approximately 15°F (dark purple) to 50°F (yellow). The
    colorbar on the right clearly shows "Temperature (°F)" with a well-defined gradient.
    The title "scatter-color-mapped · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    Points have white borders for visibility, and the expected latitude-temperature
    relationship is visible (cooler/purple in the north, warmer/yellow-green in the
    south).
