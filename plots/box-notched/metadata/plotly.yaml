review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and well-chosen font
    sizes
  - Clear notch visualization that enables statistical comparison between groups
  - Good data variety showing different distribution shapes, spreads, and outliers
    across departments
  - Realistic salary data context that demonstrates practical application
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled (showlegend=False) - while x-axis labels work, an explicit
    legend would improve accessibility
  - Could leverage Plotly interactive features more (custom hovertemplate showing
    statistics)
