review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of inverted Y-axis to show rank 1 at top (as required by spec)
  - Clean, professional appearance with plotly_white template
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Appropriate marker and line sizes for clear visibility
  - Interactive HTML output alongside PNG leverages plotly strengths
  - Data tells a compelling story with Team Alpha rise and Team Gamma brief lead in
    Week 5
  weaknesses:
  - Data is deterministic so seed is not technically needed, but consider adding np.random.seed
    for consistency if random data is ever used
  - Layout balance could be improved with legend placement closer to plot
