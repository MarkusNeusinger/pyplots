review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent forest plot structure with proper study ordering and clear visual hierarchy
  - Well-implemented diamond shape for pooled estimate with distinctive yellow color
  - Marker sizes correctly proportional to study weights showing relative importance
  - Colorblind-safe palette using blue and yellow contrast
  - Comprehensive tooltip configuration for interactive use
  - Proper reference line at null effect (0) with label
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical grid lines are too prominent - reduce alpha or lighten color for cleaner
    appearance
  - Excess whitespace below pooled estimate - tighten y-axis min value to reduce bottom
    gap
  - No Effect label on reference line is small and at top edge - increase font size
    or reposition for better visibility
