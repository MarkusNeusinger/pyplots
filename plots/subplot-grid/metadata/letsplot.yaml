review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent financial dashboard theme demonstrating diverse plot types in a cohesive
    2x2 grid
  - 'Consistent color scheme (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B) across all subplots creates
    visual unity'
  - Clean code following KISS principles with good data generation logic
  - All axis labels include units making the plots self-explanatory
  - Rolling average overlay on price chart adds analytical value
  - Scatter plot includes linear regression with confidence band
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend in price chart to distinguish actual price from moving average
    (relies on title description only)
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive interactive features (tooltips, coordinated
    brushing) even in static output
  - Scatter points in bottom-right plot could be slightly larger for better visibility
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 2x2 grid of financial dashboard visualizations:
    - **Top-left**: Stock price line chart (blue solid line) with 10-day moving average (yellow dashed line), showing prices from ~$85-$110 over 60 trading days
    - **Top-right**: Daily trading volume bar chart (blue bars) showing volume in millions, ranging from ~0.5-2.2M
    - **Bottom-left**: Histogram of daily returns (blue bars with darker border) centered around 0%, with a yellow dashed vertical line at zero
    - **Bottom-right**: Scatter plot with linear regression showing volume vs absolute return relationship, blue points with yellow trend line and gray confidence band
    - Overall title: "subplot-grid · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" at top
    - Each subplot has its own descriptive title, and all use consistent blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) color scheme
    - Clean minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines
