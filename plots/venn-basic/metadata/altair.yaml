review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear data preparation and layer composition
  - Excellent color choice with Python-themed blue/yellow/green that maintains accessibility
  - Proper use of Altair layered approach to combine filled circles, outlines, and
    text labels
  - Correct calculation of exclusive region values using inclusion-exclusion principle
  - Realistic data context representing research discipline overlaps
  weaknesses:
  - 'Poor canvas utilization: diagram is concentrated in upper half with excessive
    whitespace below'
  - Circle positions place Data Engineering at top but the set_labels list suggests
    it should be at C position (bottom)
  - Text font sizes (22-24pt at 1200x1200 with scale_factor=3.0) could be larger for
    better legibility at full resolution
  - Circles are not proportional to actual set sizes as suggested in spec notes
