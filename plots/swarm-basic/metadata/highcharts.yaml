review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent swarm algorithm implementation that spreads points horizontally to avoid
    overlap
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Realistic, domain-appropriate data showing different distribution shapes (bimodal,
    normal, tight cluster)
  - Mean markers clearly distinguish summary statistics from individual data points
  - Proper title format and clear axis labels
  - Good canvas utilization and layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears truncated or not visible in the rendered output - should verify
    legend displays properly
  - Helper function for swarm positions deviates from KISS principle (though functionally
    necessary)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Performance Score 0-100 would be more informative)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm plot showing employee performance
    scores across four departments: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales
    (purple), and Operations (cyan). Each department has data points spread horizontally
    to avoid overlap, forming characteristic swarm/beeswarm shapes. The title "swarm-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle
    "Employee Performance Scores by Department" below. Red diamond markers indicate
    the mean for each category. The y-axis shows "Performance Score" ranging from
    ~34 to 106, and the x-axis shows "Department" with category labels. The background
    is white with subtle gray dashed grid lines.'

        passed: true
        comment: Title and labels are clearly readable with appropriate font sizes
          (72px title, 48px axis titles, 36px labels). Slightly reduced because y-axis
          tick labels could be larger for the canvas size.

        comment: Points spread nicely to avoid overlap, which is the core feature
          of a swarm plot. Text elements do not overlap.

        score: 7
        max: 8
        passed: true
        comment: Markers are well-sized (radius 14) and visible. The swarm algorithm
          works well, though some categories have slightly more overlap than ideal
          due to high point density in certain score ranges.

        comment: '"Performance Score" and "Department" are descriptive but lack units
          (score could have been "Performance Score (0-100)" for full marks).'

          appears to be cut off or not visible in the rendered image.

        comment: Has individual points, swarm layout, mean markers. Spec suggested
          "subtle mean or median marker" - implemented with diamond markers, but they
          could be more subtle.

        comment: Has a helper function `compute_swarm_positions` which technically
          violates KISS, but it's necessary for the swarm algorithm. Minor deduction.

        comment: Uses Highcharts scatter series, custom markers with borders, tooltips
          with formatting. Could have used more interactive features like zoom, data
          grouping, or custom events.
  verdict: APPROVED
