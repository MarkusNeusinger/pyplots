review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Fourier transformation formula for Andrews curves
  - Perfect use of transparency (alpha=0.4) to reveal curve density and overlap patterns
  - Clear visual separation between Iris species demonstrates the technique utility
  - 'Professional use of Plotly features: legendgroup for grouped legend entries,
    custom hover templates'
  - Proper data normalization prevents any single variable from dominating the curves
  - Clean π notation on x-axis tick labels enhances readability
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) maximizes value for both static and interactive use cases
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function andrews_curve() violating the KISS no functions
    rule; should inline the transformation logic
  - Yellow color for Versicolor may be less distinguishable for colorblind users;
    consider using a more accessible palette
