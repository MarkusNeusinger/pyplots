review:
  strengths:
  - Clean declarative code structure using Altair layered chart approach
  - Excellent visualization of widening confidence interval over time (realistic forecast
    behavior)
  - Good use of semi-transparent band with appropriate opacity (0.3)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips demonstrates Altair interactivity features
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast between line and band
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is completely missing from the plot output despite code attempting to create
    one via Fill/Color legend configuration - the legend is not rendering in the saved
    PNG
  - Y-axis includes excessive whitespace starting from 0 when data ranges from ~95-180;
    the y_domain calculation exists in code but is not being applied correctly to
    the final plot
  - Point markers on the line could be slightly larger for better visibility at full
    resolution
