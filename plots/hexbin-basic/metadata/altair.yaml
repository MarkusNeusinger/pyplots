review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario using actual Seattle GPS coordinates with believable
    traffic density patterns
  - Viridis colormap is properly applied and colorblind accessible
  - Clean declarative Altair code with good use of binning transforms and tooltips
  - Multiple density clusters show variation in the data effectively
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Uses rectangular bins instead of hexagonal bins (Altair limitation acknowledged
    in comments but significantly deviates from spec requirement)
  - X-axis tick labels show duplicate values at the left edge (-122.37 appears twice)
  - No grid lines makes spatial reference between data points harder
  - Could explore using mark_circle with hexagonal positioning as a creative workaround
