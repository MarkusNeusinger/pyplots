review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with perceptually uniform color distribution
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic data scenario (geographic temperature measurements) with meaningful
    correlation
  - White edge outlines on markers improve visibility and separation
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good marker sizing and alpha for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like Normalize for explicit color range
    control
  - Grid could be even more subtle (alpha=0.2) to reduce visual noise
  - Colorbar tick label size (16pt) is slightly smaller relative to other labels (20pt)
