review:
  strengths:
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed (np.random.seed(42))
  - Descriptive axis labels with units (Price ($), Trading Day)
  - Realistic stock price simulation with 60 trading days and volume correlated to
    volatility
  - Attempt to create dual-pane layout via PIL image stacking shows understanding
    of spec requirement
  weaknesses:
  - Not a candlestick chart - Uses line chart with dots instead of candlesticks showing
    rectangular bodies (open-close) and wicks (high-low); pygal has no native candlestick
    support but Box chart could approximate OHLC representation
  - Single-pane output despite code attempting dual-pane stacking - The generated
    image shows overlaid charts not stacked panes; the PIL stacking approach may not
    be rendering correctly
  - Volume overlay severely obscures price data - The gray filled area covers the
    entire chart height making price lines unreadable in lower portions
  - Missing bullish/bearish color scheme on candlesticks - Individual OHLC values
    shown in different colors but candles should be green/red based on close vs open
  - Title format incorrect - Should be candlestick-volume · pygal · pyplots.ai without
    the prefix
