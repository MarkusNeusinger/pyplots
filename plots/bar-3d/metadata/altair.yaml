review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using isometric projection to simulate 3D in a 2D
    library
  - Good painter's algorithm implementation for proper depth ordering of bar faces
  - Viridis colormap provides clear value encoding and is colorblind-accessible
  - Interactive tooltips show exact product, quarter, and sales values
  - Realistic business data with seasonal variation and growth trends
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label says Sales Revenue (Relative Height) but axis tick values do not
    correspond to actual sales values
  - Quarter labels positioning could be clearer - they overlap with depth axis indicator
  - Spec suggests semi-transparent bars for revealing occluded bars which is not implemented
