review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic business scenario with company budget allocation across departments
    and teams
  - Proper area-proportional sizing using sqrt transformation
  - Good layered approach using Altair chart composition
  - Correct title format and output file generation
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Good tooltip implementation for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Circle overlap is severe - circles from different departments overlap significantly,
    violating the core circle packing principle
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output despite being coded
  - All circles appear the same blue color - department color differentiation not
    working
  - Code uses functions which violates the KISS principle
  - Department labels not visible on their containing circles
