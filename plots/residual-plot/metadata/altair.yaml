review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including zero reference
    line, LOESS smoothing, ±2σ bands, and outlier highlighting
  - Clear demonstration of non-linear residual pattern through LOESS line - educationally
    valuable
  - Strong colorblind-safe palette with Python logo colors (blue/yellow)
  - Good use of Altair declarative layering for combining multiple visual elements
  - Realistic housing price scenario makes the plot immediately comprehensible
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement is slightly isolated from the main chart area - could be positioned
    closer
  - Points use outlined circles which can be slightly less visible than filled circles
    at smaller sizes
  - The grid lines behind the ±2σ dashed lines create slight visual noise
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot for housing price predictions
    with "Fitted Values ($)" on the x-axis (ranging from 0 to ~520,000) and "Residuals
    ($)" on the y-axis (ranging from -50,000 to +40,000). Blue outlined circles represent
    "Normal" data points, while yellow outlined circles denote "Outlier (>2σ)" points.
    A black dashed horizontal reference line at y=0 indicates perfect predictions.
    Two gray dashed horizontal lines mark the ±2 standard deviation boundaries (~±31,000).
    A prominent red LOESS smoothing line reveals a characteristic "U-shaped" pattern
    in the residuals, starting high, dipping negative in the mid-range, and rising
    again - clearly demonstrating the non-linear relationship that the linear model
    failed to capture. The legend is positioned on the right side with "Point Type"
    header. The title correctly follows the format "residual-plot · altair · pyplots.ai".
