review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex specialized meteorological diagram
  - All required reference lines (isotherms, dry/moist adiabats, mixing ratio lines)
    are present and properly computed
  - Skew transformation correctly implemented at 45 degrees
  - Logarithmic pressure axis properly inverted (1000 hPa at bottom)
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all line types
  - Clean visual distinction between data profiles and reference lines
  - Proper physics formulas used for adiabatic calculations
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions instead of pure linear code structure (minor KISS violation)
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Some reference lines (especially mixing ratio) are quite faint and may be hard
    to distinguish
  image_description: The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a light
    gray background and white plot area. The pressure axis (Y) runs from 1000 hPa
    at the bottom to 100 hPa at the top on a logarithmic scale. Skewed isotherms (gray
    dashed lines at 45°) cross the diagram diagonally. Orange dry adiabats curve through
    the plot. Green dashed moist adiabats are visible. Light blue dashed mixing ratio
    lines appear. A solid red line with data points shows the temperature profile
    descending from ~28°C at 1000 hPa to ~-55°C at 100 hPa. A dashed blue line with
    data points shows the dewpoint profile, consistently colder than temperature.
    The title "skewt-logp-atmospheric · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is at the top. A
    legend box in the upper right identifies all line types. Axis labels show "Pressure
    (hPa)" vertically and "Temperature (°C)" horizontally with temperature values
    at the bottom.
