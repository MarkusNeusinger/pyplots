review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adherence to sparkline design principles with complete removal of chart
    chrome (axes, labels, gridlines)
  - 'Well-implemented optional features: min/max highlights with red/green dots, first/last
    points with yellow dots, subtle fill under line'
  - Good color choices with Python blue (#306998) and accessible highlight colors
  - Proper aspect ratio and canvas utilization for the 16:9 format
  - Clean, readable KISS-style code structure
  weaknesses:
  - The aspect ratio could be more compact (spec suggests 4:1 to 8:1 for sparklines,
    current is 16:9) but this works for standalone display
  - Library features score is moderate - implementation relies heavily on matplotlib
    underneath with sns.lineplot being a thin wrapper
