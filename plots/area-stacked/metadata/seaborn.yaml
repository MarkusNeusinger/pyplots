review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with harmonious color palette including Python blue as
    primary color
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with good data generation
  - Proper title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal patterns and growth trend
  - Good use of date formatting with rotated labels to prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use distinctive seaborn plot functions - stackplot is a matplotlib function,
    only seaborn styling is applied
  - Legend position overlaps with data area - could be moved outside or use upper
    right
  - Data series all follow similar sinusoidal patterns - more variety in trends would
    better demonstrate stacked area features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing monthly revenue
    by product category over a 2-year period (Feb 2023 to Feb 2025). Four product
    categories are shown: Electronics (dark blue/Python blue, #306998) at the bottom,
    Clothing (golden yellow, #FFD43B), Home & Garden (teal/turquoise, #4ECDC4), and
    Sports (coral/salmon, #FF6B6B) at the top. The Y-axis shows "Revenue (Million
    $)" ranging from 0 to ~145, and the X-axis shows months with quarterly intervals.
    A legend titled "Product Category" is positioned in the upper left. The areas
    show seasonal fluctuations with an overall growth trend. The baseline correctly
    starts at zero.'
