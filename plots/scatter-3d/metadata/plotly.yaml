review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's 3D visualization capabilities with proper Scatter3d
    implementation
  - Viridis colormap provides colorblind-safe color encoding for the 4th dimension
    (Z value)
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate spatial relationships and clustering
    patterns
  - 'Well-configured camera angle (eye: 1.5, 1.5, 1.2) provides good initial 3D perspective'
  - Clean, maintainable code structure following KISS principles
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "X Coordinate (units)" would be more informative)
  - Colorbar styling could be more consistent with axis styling (thickness and positioning)
