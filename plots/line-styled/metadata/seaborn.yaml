review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    clearly differentiating the series
  - Realistic temperature data context with appropriate seasonal patterns across different
    climate regions
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good font sizing throughout meeting the 4800×2700 target resolution requirements
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage seaborn native palette system instead of manually specifying colors
  - Data context is generic (Coastal, Continental) rather than specific real-world
    regions
  image_description: 'The plot displays four line series representing temperature
    trends across 12 months (Jan-Dec) for different climate regions. The lines use
    distinct styles: Coastal (solid blue), Continental (dashed yellow/gold), Mountain
    (dotted green), and Mediterranean (dash-dot red/crimson). The title reads "line-styled
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. X-axis shows month abbreviations, Y-axis shows
    "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately -5 to 33. All four series show the
    expected seasonal pattern with peaks in July-August. The legend is positioned
    in the upper right with a semi-transparent background. A subtle dashed grid helps
    with value reading.'
