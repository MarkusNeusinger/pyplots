review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly go.Sankey with proper node/link configuration
  - Well-chosen color scheme with source-based link coloring and appropriate transparency
  - Realistic energy distribution scenario that effectively demonstrates Sankey diagram
    purpose
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data organization
  - Proper output sizing (1600x900 scale=3) producing 4800x2700 target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Could include flow value labels on hover or annotations to show exact TWh values
  - Transportation sector only receives flows from Gas and Renewables, missing Coal
    and Nuclear contributions
  image_description: "The plot displays a Sankey diagram showing energy distribution\
    \ from four source nodes (Natural Gas, Nuclear, Renewables, Coal) on the left\
    \ to four target nodes (Residential, Commercial, Transportation, Industrial) on\
    \ the right. \n\n**Colors**: Source nodes use distinct colors - dark blue for\
    \ Coal, light blue for Natural Gas, yellow for Nuclear, and green for Renewables.\
    \ Target nodes use muted grayish-blue tones. Flow links are semi-transparent (alpha\
    \ ~0.5) and colored to match their source.\n\n**Title**: \"Energy Distribution\
    \ · sankey-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai\" centered at top in appropriate font size.\n\
    \n**Layout**: The diagram fills the canvas well with adequate margins. Node labels\
    \ are positioned clearly next to their respective nodes. Flow widths are proportional\
    \ to values, making it easy to identify major pathways (Natural Gas → Residential\
    \ being the largest flow)."
