review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the S-N curve concept with proper logarithmic x-axis
  - Clear visualization of all three key material properties (Ultimate, Yield, Endurance)
    with distinct colors
  - Realistic fatigue test data with appropriate scatter using Basquin equation
  - Good use of sns.set_context("talk") for proper text sizing
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Properly labeled axes with units (MPa)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper right partially crowds the data area; consider "lower left" placement
  - Only single log scale (x-axis) - spec mentions "Both axes typically use logarithmic
    scales"
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N (Wöhler) curve for structural steel
    fatigue analysis. The x-axis shows "Number of Cycles to Failure (N)" on a logarithmic
    scale from 10³ to 10⁸. The y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from
    150 to 500 MPa. Blue circular markers (with white edges) represent individual
    test data points showing characteristic scatter typical of fatigue testing. A
    dark blue solid line represents the S-N curve fit following the Basquin equation.
    Three horizontal dashed reference lines indicate key material properties: red
    for Ultimate Strength (450 MPa), yellow/gold for Yield Strength (350 MPa), and
    green for Endurance Limit (200 MPa). The legend is positioned in the upper right
    corner with good visibility. The title uses the correct format "sn-curve-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle with alpha transparency. The overall
    color scheme is colorblind-accessible.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot and sns.set_context for styling. Could leverage
          additional seaborn features like regplot.
