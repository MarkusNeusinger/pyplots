review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of color families: each department has its own hue with lighter
    shades for subcategories, making hierarchy immediately apparent'
  - Clean nested ring implementation using domain positioning and hole parameters
  - Professional center annotation showing total budget value
  - Good hover templates with currency formatting ($%{value}M)
  - White separator lines between segments enhance readability
  - Proper sort=False to maintain data alignment between rings
  weaknesses:
  - Inner ring labels show only percentages, not department names (though visible
    in legend)
  - Child segment alignment with parent boundaries could be visually verified more
    explicitly
  - Could benefit from pull effect or hover highlighting to emphasize interactivity
