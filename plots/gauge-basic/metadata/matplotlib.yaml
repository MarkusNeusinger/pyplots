review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib low-level primitives (Wedge, Circle) for custom gauge
    visualization
  - Clean professional appearance with well-proportioned elements
  - 'All spec requirements implemented: semi-circular gauge, color zones, needle,
    value display, tick marks'
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Realistic Current Sales context with sensible threshold values
  weaknesses:
  - Red/yellow/green color scheme follows spec convention but is not colorblind-accessible
  - Could add minor tick marks between major values for finer reading
