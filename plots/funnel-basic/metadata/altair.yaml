review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent funnel visualization using centered horizontal bars with x/x2 encoding
  - Clear value labels with both absolute values and percentages
  - Attractive Python-themed color gradient from blue to yellow
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following the grammar of graphics
  - Proper title format and good text sizing throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from tooltips for enhanced interactivity in the HTML version
  - Middle blue stages (Interest, Consideration, Intent) have subtle color differences
    that could be more distinct
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic funnel chart with 5 stages arranged
    vertically from top to bottom: Awareness (dark blue, 1000), Interest (medium blue,
    600), Consideration (lighter blue, 400), Intent (light blue, 200), and Purchase
    (yellow, 100). Each stage is represented as a horizontally centered bar with rounded
    corners. The bars progressively narrow from top to bottom, creating the classic
    funnel shape. Stage labels appear on the left y-axis in bold text, while value
    labels with percentages (e.g., "1000 (100.0%)", "600 (60.0%)") are positioned
    to the right of each bar. The title "funnel-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The color scheme transitions from Python blue (#306998) to yellow
    (#FFD43B), providing good visual differentiation between stages.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative grammar well with mark_bar, encode, x/x2
          for bar range. Could have used tooltips or interactivity for bonus points.
  verdict: APPROVED
