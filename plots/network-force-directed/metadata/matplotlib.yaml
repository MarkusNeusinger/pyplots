review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    from scratch
  - Clear community structure emerges naturally from the physics simulation
  - Good visual hierarchy with node sizing by degree, highlighting important hubs
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, coral avoids red-green confusion)
  - Clean use of LineCollection for efficient edge rendering
  - Appropriate labeling of only high-degree hub nodes to avoid clutter
  - Well-balanced canvas utilization with good margins
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap where two hub labels partially overlap their respective nodes
  - Python 3.10+ specific code (strict=True in zip) may cause compatibility issues
  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph with 50 nodes
    organized into 3 distinct community clusters. The three communities are visually
    separated: Engineering (blue, #306998) on the right side, Marketing (yellow, #FFD43B)
    in the bottom-left area, and Sales (coral/salmon, #E07B53) in the upper-left/center
    region. Nodes are sized by their degree (number of connections), with larger nodes
    representing more connected "hub" individuals. Six hub nodes are labeled with
    "Hub (E)", "Hub (M)", and "Hub (S)" indicating the top-connected nodes in each
    team. Edges are rendered as semi-transparent gray lines connecting nodes. The
    title "network-force-directed · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold. A legend in the upper-left corner identifies the three team colors. Axes
    are turned off, giving a clean network visualization appearance.'
