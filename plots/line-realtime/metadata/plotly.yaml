review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of real-time visualization indicators (LIVE badge, current
    value marker, scrolling direction arrow)
  - Creative use of vrect shapes to create fade effect indicating data scroll direction
  - Well-structured code with realistic CPU usage data including oscillation pattern
    and spikes
  - Good use of Plotly annotation system for the arrow and text labels
  - Outputs both static PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptor before spec-id instead of exact format
  - Fade effect using vrect covers some data points reducing left portion readability
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is too subtle, could be 0.2-0.3 for better visibility
