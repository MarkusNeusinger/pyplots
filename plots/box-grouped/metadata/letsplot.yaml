quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-sized fonts throughout (28pt title, 22pt labels,
    18pt ticks)
  - Clean KISS code structure following the grammar of graphics pattern
  - Realistic employee performance data scenario with appropriate variation across
    groups
  - Proper use of categorical ordering to ensure consistent display
  - Good alpha transparency (0.85) making boxes visually appealing
  - Correct implementation of all spec requirements including outliers
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio with scale=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Performance scores exceeding 100% is slightly unrealistic for a percentage metric
  - Legend title Experience Level in labs() but legend fill parameter just says fill
    - minor label inconsistency
  - Does not leverage lets-plot interactive features in the HTML export (tooltips
    would enhance the visualization)
