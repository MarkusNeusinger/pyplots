review:
  strengths:
  - Clean visual presentation with minimal theme and readable text
  - Appropriate cluster data generation for demonstrating brush selection scenarios
  - Correct color scheme with good distinction between clusters
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot-style grammar
  - Code follows KISS principle with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Missing brush selection functionality - the core feature of the specification
    is not implemented'
  - No visual rectangle shown during brush dragging
  - No highlighting mechanism for selected points
  - No reset/clear selection button
  - No demonstration of zoom toolbar or double-click zoom
  - No status area showing count of selected points
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with 400 data points distributed
    across 4 distinct clusters. The title "scatter-brush-zoom · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. The X-axis is labeled "X Value" (range -5 to 105) and
    Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" (range 0 to 100). Four clusters are color-coded: Cluster
    A (blue, ~80 points centered around x=20, y=60), Cluster B (yellow, ~120 points
    centered around x=50, y=30), Cluster C (red, ~100 points centered around x=70,
    y=70), and Cluster D (green, ~100 points centered around x=40, y=80). The legend
    is positioned on the right side with clear category labels. The plot uses a minimal
    theme with subtle grid lines and good spacing between elements.'
