review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of real-world data scenario (human heights by gender) with realistic
    statistical parameters
  - Proper use of pygal native Histogram class with correct tuple format (height,
    start, end)
  - Good transparency setting (opacity=0.5) allows overlapping regions to be clearly
    visible
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate comments
  - Font sizes well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text Female collides with X-axis title Height (cm) - needs increased margin_bottom
    or adjusted legend positioning
  - Does not leverage pygal distinctive interactive features (tooltips, value formatters,
    custom hover effects) that differentiate it from static libraries
