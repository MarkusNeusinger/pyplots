review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using Altair layered composition and geoshape
    for the filled polygon
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear separation of data preparation and visualization
    layers
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of transparency (0.25) for the filled area as recommended in spec
  - Well-positioned labels outside the chart boundary with appropriate offset
  - Includes interactive tooltips showing category and score on hover
  - Grid hexagons properly closed and matching the 6-axis layout
  weaknesses:
  - Only shows single series when spec allows 1-3 series for comparison
  - Value range (70-90) is somewhat narrow; wider spread would better demonstrate
    strengths and weaknesses
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal radar chart showing employee performance
    scores across 6 competencies. The chart uses a cohesive blue color scheme (#306998)
    with the following elements:

    - **Data polygon**: Blue filled area with ~25% transparency, clearly showing the
    performance profile

    - **Axes**: 6 spokes radiating from center for Communication (85), Technical Skills
    (90), Teamwork (75), Problem Solving (88), Leadership (70), and Creativity (82)

    - **Grid lines**: Hexagonal grid lines at 5 levels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) with
    subtle gray color

    - **Labels**: Category labels positioned outside the chart, value labels near
    each data point

    - **Data points**: Solid blue circles at each vertex of the polygon

    - **Title**: "radar-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" at top in proper format'

        comment: Creative use of GeoJSON/geoshape for polygon fill, layered composition
          typical of Altair. However, Altair doesn't have native radar chart support,
          requiring manual polar-to-Cartesian conversion.
  verdict: APPROVED
