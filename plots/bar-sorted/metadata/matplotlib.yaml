review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal bar orientation making category labels highly readable
  - Clean sorting implementation with clear visual hierarchy from largest to smallest
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability as recommended in spec
  - Professional styling with removed spines, subtle grid, and white edge color on
    bars
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - Data scenario is somewhat generic (product categories with random values); could
    use a more specific real-world dataset
  - Does not demonstrate any advanced matplotlib features beyond basic bar chart functionality
