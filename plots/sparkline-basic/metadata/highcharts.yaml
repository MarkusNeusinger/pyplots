review:
  strengths:
  - Clean minimalist design perfectly captures sparkline aesthetic with no axes/gridlines
  - Colorblind-safe color palette using orange and teal instead of red-green
  - Good use of min/max point markers to highlight extremes
  - Realistic data generation with trend, seasonality, and noise components
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - End point marker (yellow) is not clearly visible in the rendered image
  - Could use Highcharts sparkline-specific modules for more authentic sparkline rendering
  - Marker sizes could be slightly larger for better visibility at the rendered resolution
