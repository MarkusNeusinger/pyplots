review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing clusters, gaps, and outliers as specified
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Smart workaround using geom_segment to implement rug marks since lets-plot lacks
    native geom_rug
  - Good alpha transparency on density fill to avoid obscuring rug marks
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks are quite thin/small and could be slightly more prominent while still
    maintaining the small relative to plot requirement
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current alpha appears around 0.5, spec prefers
    0.2-0.4)
