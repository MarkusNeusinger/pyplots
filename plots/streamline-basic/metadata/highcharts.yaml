review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe viridis-inspired color palette encoding velocity magnitude
  - Proper implementation of streamline tracing using Euler integration through the
    vector field
  - Correct title format and informative subtitle explaining the mathematical model
  - Good use of Highcharts with proper Selenium-based PNG export
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could add "(arbitrary units)" or similar for mathematical
    context)
  - Inner streamlines are densely packed making individual paths harder to distinguish
  - No color scale legend to quantify the velocity magnitude mapping
