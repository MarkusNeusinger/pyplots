review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent clean dashboard aesthetic with professional appearance
  - Good use of facet_wrap for creating the tile grid layout
  - Color coding by status (green/orange/red) is well-implemented
  - Sparklines provide useful trend context for each metric
  - Realistic operations monitoring scenario with appropriate data values
  - Proper title format following the spec convention
  weaknesses:
  - Change indicators are uniformly gray instead of colored green/red based on favorable/unfavorable
    changes as specified
  - Sparklines could be slightly thicker for better visibility
  - Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like stat transformations
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3x2 grid of 6 metric dashboard tiles on a light gray background. Each tile contains:
    - A metric name at the top in dark gray bold text (CPU Usage, Memory, Response Time, Active Users, Error Rate, Throughput)
    - A large prominent value in the center colored by status: green for good metrics (#27AE60), orange/yellow for warning (#F39C12 - Memory at 72%), red for critical (#E74C3C - Error Rate at 0.8%)
    - A change indicator below with up/down triangle arrows and percentage values in gray
    - A sparkline chart at the bottom of each tile showing trend history, with the line color matching the status
    - The sparklines sit on a slightly darker gray background band
    - Title at the top reads "dashboard-metrics-tiles · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    - Overall clean dashboard aesthetic with white tile backgrounds and consistent spacing
