review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh patch() method to create custom trapezoidal funnel segments
  - Clear, well-sized text labels with smart color contrast (dark text on yellow background)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Proper implementation of width proportional to values relative to first stage
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with good comments
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Could improve canvas utilization by making funnel slightly larger to reduce
    bottom whitespace'
  - 'Minor: Color palette includes red-green combination (though not as sole differentiator)'
