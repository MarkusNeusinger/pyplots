review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme with consistent branch coloring (children
    visually relate to parents)
  - Smart label placement logic that only shows labels for sufficiently large segments
    (>15° for level 2, >12° for level 3)
  - Clean white edge separators (linewidth=2.5) provide clear visual hierarchy distinction
  - Square aspect ratio (12x12) is perfect choice for radial visualization
  - Real-world budget scenario with meaningful department/team/project hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed or explicit reproducibility comment (deterministic data mitigates
    this)
  - Could use more extreme value variation between segments to better demonstrate
    proportional sizing
  - White label color on inner ring may reduce contrast on lighter portions
