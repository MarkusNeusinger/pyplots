review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title formatting following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Professional colorblind-safe palette (Python Blue, Yellow, Purple)
  - 'Good use of Highcharts features: data labels, styled legend with border/shadow,
    dashed grid lines'
  - Appropriate 4800x2700 sizing with properly scaled font sizes
  - Clean code structure following the library-specific export pattern with inline
    JS
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful data context
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis has too many tick intervals (every $10K from 0 to $420K creates 43 tick
    marks), making the grid overly dense
  - All three product lines show uniform upward trends - data could demonstrate more
    varied patterns (e.g., one declining, seasonal variations)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart with 4 quarters (Q1, Q2,
    Q3, Q4) on the x-axis and revenue values on the y-axis. Three product lines are
    shown as grouped vertical bars: Electronics (blue #306998), Clothing (yellow #FFD43B),
    and Home & Garden (purple #9467BD). The title "bar-grouped · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears prominently at the top with a subtitle "Quarterly Revenue by Product Line
    (in thousands USD)". Each bar has data labels showing values (e.g., $245K, $312K,
    $287K, $398K for Electronics). The y-axis displays "Revenue (thousands USD)" with
    formatted tick labels ($0K to $420K in $10K increments), and the x-axis shows
    "Quarter". A boxed legend with the three product lines is positioned in the top-right
    corner with a subtle border and shadow.'
