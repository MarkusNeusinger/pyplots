review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Bollinger Bands with all required components (price,
    SMA, upper/lower bands, filled envelope)
  - Good color scheme with prominent black price line, contrasting yellow SMA, and
    coordinated blue bands
  - Proper use of dashed line for SMA as spec suggests
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Correct 4800x2700 output using scale=3 method
  - Good hover tooltips with formatted price values
  - Semi-transparent fill between bands implemented correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows 5 separate items when Upper Band and Lower Band could potentially
    share a legend entry since they use the same color
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Bollinger Bands indicator chart with stock price data from late January 2024 through early June 2024. The chart shows:
    - A black line representing the closing price, which starts around $97-100, rises briefly to ~$103, then trends downward to ~$84 by late March before recovering to ~$95 by June
    - A yellow dashed line showing the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which smoothly follows the price trend
    - Blue solid lines for the upper and lower Bollinger Bands (±2σ), with the bands widening during volatile periods and narrowing during calmer periods
    - A light blue semi-transparent fill between the upper and lower bands representing the volatility envelope
    - The title "indicator-bollinger · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    - A horizontal legend above the plot showing all five elements: Close Price, 20-day SMA, Lower Band (-2σ), Upper Band (+2σ), and Bollinger Bands (2σ)
    - X-axis labeled "Date" with business day dates, Y-axis labeled "Price ($)" with dollar-formatted values from $85 to $110
    - Subtle gray grid lines on white background
