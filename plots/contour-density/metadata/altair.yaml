review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of 2D KDE computation with scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
  - Clean three-cluster data that clearly demonstrates density visualization
  - Good use of blues colormap for accessibility
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Excellent canvas utilization and layout balance
  - Descriptive axis labels with proper units
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter point overlay is invisible (size=30, opacity=0.4 too small against heatmap
    background) - consider removing or making much more prominent
  - Temperature values reach 75°C which is unrealistic for weather data - should cap
    at ~45°C for believability
  - Y-axis tick labels are excessive (every 2 units creates 37+ labels) - use fewer
    tick marks for cleaner appearance
  - Grid is configured but not visible in the output
