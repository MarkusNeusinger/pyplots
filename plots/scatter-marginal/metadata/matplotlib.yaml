review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GridSpec layout with proper axis alignment between main scatter and
    marginal histograms
  - Clean bimodal data generation showing correlation structure
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) reveals density patterns without obscuring
    points
  - Consistent styling throughout (colors, edge colors, spine visibility)
  - Subtle grid styling that aids readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Generic axis labels (X Value, Y Value) rather than domain-specific labels with
    units
  - Could overlay KDE curves on histograms as spec suggests this is an option
  - Marker size (s=120) slightly larger than optimal for 200 points per guidelines
    (should be ~50-100)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with marginal distributions
    using matplotlib GridSpec layout. The central scatter plot shows 200 blue data
    points (#306998) with white edges and alpha=0.65, revealing a clear positive linear
    correlation (r≈0.7). Two clusters are visible in the data corresponding to the
    bimodal X distribution. The top marginal histogram shows the X distribution with
    two distinct peaks (around 30 and 60), while the right marginal histogram displays
    the Y distribution (roughly unimodal, centered ~45). All elements use consistent
    blue coloring. The title "scatter-marginal · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears
    in the top-right corner. Axis labels show "X Value", "Y Value" for the main plot
    and "Count" for marginals. A subtle dashed grid (alpha=0.3) aids readability.

        comment: Good use of GridSpec for complex layout, sharex/sharey for axis alignment,
          but could leverage more advanced matplotlib features like KDE overlay or
          Axes insets
  verdict: APPROVED
