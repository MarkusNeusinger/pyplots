review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of LineCollection for smooth gradient coloring effect showing temporal
    progression
  - Creative marker size progression reinforces the building over time concept
  - Well-designed final point highlight with yellow glow effect draws attention to
    endpoint
  - Good explanatory annotation helps viewers understand the visualization technique
  - Clean, publication-ready visual quality with appropriate font sizes
  - Realistic and engaging temperature data with clear seasonal patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Missing formal legend to explain the marker size and color gradient meaning
  - Static implementation only; spec mentions animation should be smooth with configurable
    speed (though static output with progression indicator is acceptable per spec
    notes)
  image_description: The plot displays a progressive line chart showing monthly temperature
    readings from 2020 to 2024. The line uses a gradient colormap transitioning from
    light blue (earlier months) to dark/Python blue (later months), effectively conveying
    the temporal direction of the data. Circular markers are placed at each data point,
    with marker sizes progressively increasing from left to right (smaller at start,
    larger at end). The final data point is highlighted with a yellow circle and glow
    effect, accompanied by an arrow pointing right to emphasize progression direction.
    A text annotation box in the top-left corner explains the visualization technique.
    The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from 0 to ~30, and the x-axis shows
    years 2020-2024. Clear seasonal patterns are visible with temperatures oscillating
    between winter lows (~5°C) and summer highs (~27°C). A subtle dashed grid aids
    readability.

          for custom colormap; could have used more advanced matplotlib animation
          features but static output is acceptable per spec
