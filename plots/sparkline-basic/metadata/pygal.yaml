review:
  strengths:
  - Clean minimal design appropriate for sparklines - no axes, labels, or gridlines
  - Good use of area fill under the line for visual impact
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with balanced margins
  - Title follows correct format specification
  - Realistic data context (daily sales trend)
  - Smooth cubic interpolation creates clean line appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Min/max point highlights not working correctly - yellow dots (#FFD43B) are not
    visible; only a single blue dot appears at max point
  - Legend text appears at bottom left despite show_legend=False setting
  - Data pattern is predominantly upward trending rather than showing balanced growth
    and decline periods
