review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements the fundamental Skew-T Log-P thermodynamic structure with
    skewed isotherms
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with proper temperature/dewpoint profiles
  - Good use of Altair layer composition for multiple reference line systems
  - All reference lines (isotherms, dry/moist adiabats, mixing ratios) are present
  - Temperature and dewpoint profiles clearly distinguished by color and line style
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible - the legend data points render inside the plot area as
    regular markers rather than as a proper legend panel
  - Y-axis label missing units (should be Pressure hPa not just pressure)
  - X-axis domain too wide creating unused white space on the right
  image_description: The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a white
    background. The pressure axis (Y-axis) is logarithmic and inverted, ranging from
    1000 hPa at the bottom to 100 hPa at the top. The X-axis shows skewed temperature
    values ranging from -40 to 120. The temperature profile is rendered as a solid
    red line with circular markers, extending from approximately 25°C at surface (1000
    hPa) to around -55°C at the tropopause. The dewpoint profile is shown as a dashed
    blue line with circular markers, depicting the expected moisture decrease with
    altitude. Reference lines include gray dashed isotherms at 45-degree angles, green
    dry adiabats curving from lower-left to upper-right, purple/magenta dashed moist
    adiabats, and blue dashed mixing ratio lines. The title "skewt-logp-atmospheric
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The legend was coded but is not visible
    in the output image - the legend points appear within the visible plotting domain
    as regular plot points rather than a separate legend panel. The Y-axis label shows
    only "pressure" without units.
