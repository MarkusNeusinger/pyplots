review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (Q for quantitative)
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate font sizes and gradient dimensions
  - Interactive tooltips enhance data exploration
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Altair interactive capabilities
  - Good marker styling with stroke for point definition
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar/legend title Intensity lacks units - should indicate the measurement
    scale
  - Grid styling could benefit from slightly lower opacity (0.2 instead of 0.3) for
    subtler appearance
