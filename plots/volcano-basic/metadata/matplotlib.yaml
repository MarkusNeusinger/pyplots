review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including threshold lines, color
    coding, and gene annotations
  - Scientifically accurate data simulation with p-values correlated to fold change
    magnitude
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper axis formatting with subscript notation (Log₂, Log₁₀)
  - Symmetric axis limits for better visual interpretation
  - Good alpha transparency for handling overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Marker sizes could be larger (s=100-200 recommended for 2000 points density)
  - No use of distinctive matplotlib features like PathEffects for label backgrounds
    or custom colormaps
  - Legend placement in upper right could potentially overlap with high-significance
    up-regulated points
