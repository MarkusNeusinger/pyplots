review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual box plot construction using Bokeh primitives (Whisker, vbar,
    segment)
  - Good use of jitter transform for strip points to reduce overlap
  - Proper colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow contrast)
  - Well-calculated IQR-based whiskers with proper outlier handling
  - Clear demonstration of different distributions and outliers across categories
  - Font sizes properly scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what box/strip elements represent (minor for this plot type)
  - Could add HoverTool to show exact values on hover for the HTML version
  - The median line segment has zero width (x0=x1) which works but is technically
    a point not a line
  image_description: The plot displays a box plot with strip overlay showing plant
    growth (cm) across four soil types (Sandy, Clay, Loamy, Silty). The boxes are
    rendered in a muted blue color (#306998) with 40% transparency, showing median
    lines as darker horizontal segments. Yellow/gold circular markers (#FFD43B) with
    dark gold borders represent individual data points, scattered with jitter across
    each category. The title "cat-box-strip · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    left in dark text. The x-axis is labeled "Soil Type" and y-axis "Plant Growth
    (cm)". The background is a subtle off-white (#fafafa) with light gray dashed horizontal
    grid lines. Whiskers extend from boxes to show data range, with visible outliers
    in Clay (high values ~55-58) and Silty (low values ~12-14).

        comment: Good use of ColumnDataSource, Whisker annotations, jitter transform.
          Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
