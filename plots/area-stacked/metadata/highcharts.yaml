review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice with high contrast between series
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format and all required features
  - Realistic business scenario with 24 months of revenue data showing clear trends
  - Proper baseline at zero as required by spec
  - Good use of Highcharts stacking with normal stacking mode and fillOpacity for
    visibility
  - Well-configured tooltip with shared format showing all series values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend background color creates slight visual disconnection from the chart area
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (currently visible but not distracting)
