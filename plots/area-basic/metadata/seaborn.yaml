review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic weekly patterns, upward trend, and a
    viral post spike — makes the area chart compelling and informative
  - Clean annotation with arrow pointing to the traffic spike adds storytelling value
  - Proper use of seaborn theming (whitegrid style, talk context) provides a polished,
    professional look
  - Semi-transparent fill at alpha 0.4 balances visual weight with readability
  - Y-axis starting at 0 correctly emphasizes the volume aspect of the area chart
  weaknesses:
  - The fill_between call is pure matplotlib rather than a seaborn-native feature
    — though this is unavoidable since seaborn lacks a dedicated area chart function
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 days). A single blue (#306998) line traces the visitor count
    with the area below filled in a semi-transparent blue (alpha ~0.4). The y-axis
    starts at 0 and extends to approximately 11,200 with label "Visitors (count)".
    The x-axis shows dates from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-30, with labels rotated 45°
    for readability. A clear weekly cyclic pattern is visible — peaks mid-week around
    6,000-7,000 and dips on weekends to ~3,500-4,000. An upward trend is apparent
    over the month. A notable traffic spike around January 18 reaches ~10,300 visitors,
    annotated with "Viral post" and an arrow pointing to the peak. The background
    uses a whitegrid style with dashed gridlines at low opacity. A legend in the upper
    left shows "Daily visitors". The title reads "area-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    in the correct format.

        comment: Good use of sns.set_style, sns.set_context, and sns.lineplot. Area
          fill uses matplotlib fill_between since seaborn lacks native area chart
          function.
  verdict: APPROVED
