review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density-based swarm jitter algorithm
  - Beautiful color scheme with Python blue violin and yellow points providing strong
    contrast
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment C effectively demonstrates the hybrid visualization
    power
  - Median lines add useful statistical reference
  - 'All spec requirements met: violin transparency, point overlay, horizontal spread'
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend explaining what violin vs points represent
  - Point size s=80 slightly small for 50 points per group; s=100-120 would be more
    visible
  - Manual swarm implementation is verbose compared to using built-in functionality
  image_description: The plot displays a violin-swarm visualization comparing reaction
    times across 4 experimental conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment
    C). Each violin is rendered in a semi-transparent blue (#306998 with alpha 0.4),
    showing kernel density estimation of the distribution. Yellow (#FFD43B) circular
    points with blue edges are overlaid as a swarm on each violin, representing individual
    observations (50 per group). Dark horizontal lines mark the median for each group.
    The y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 250-650ms, and
    the x-axis shows "Experimental Condition". Treatment C shows a bimodal distribution
    as intended, with two clusters of points visible. Points are well-jittered horizontally
    to avoid overlap while staying within violin boundaries. A subtle dashed grid
    is present on the y-axis. The title correctly follows the spec-id · library ·
    pyplots.ai format.
