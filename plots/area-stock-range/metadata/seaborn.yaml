review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the range selector concept for a static library
  - Visual representation of preset range buttons is creative and informative
  - Good use of color contrast between main chart (blue) and selection highlight (yellow)
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility
  - Clean two-panel layout with appropriate proportions
  weaknesses:
  - The range selector text label is slightly small and could be more prominent
  - The grid styling differs between main chart and range selector, creating slight
    visual inconsistency
  image_description: The plot displays a stock area chart with two panels. The main
    panel (top) shows approximately 6 months of stock price data from May 2024 to
    November 2024, with prices ranging from ~$100 to ~$130. The area beneath the price
    line is filled with semi-transparent blue (#306998). The y-axis displays "Price
    (USD)" with dollar-formatted tick labels. The bottom panel serves as a range selector/mini
    chart, showing the full ~3-year history (2022-01 to 2025-01) with a yellow-highlighted
    region indicating the currently selected 6-month period. Yellow vertical lines
    mark the selection boundaries. Preset range buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, ALL)
    appear in the top-right corner, with "6M" highlighted in yellow to indicate the
    active selection. The title correctly follows the format "area-stock-range · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai".
