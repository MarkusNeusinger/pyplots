# contour-map-geographic: Contour Lines on Geographic Map

## Description

A contour map overlays isolines (lines of equal value) onto a geographic basemap, visualizing continuous spatial data such as elevation, temperature, or atmospheric pressure across real-world coordinates. Unlike basic contour plots that use abstract x/y coordinates, this plot anchors contours to latitude/longitude positions with geographic context like coastlines, borders, or terrain. It combines the precision of isoline visualization with spatial awareness, making it ideal for meteorological, topographic, and environmental applications.

## Applications

- Topographic elevation maps showing terrain contours with labeled heights
- Weather maps displaying pressure systems (isobars) or temperature gradients (isotherms)
- Environmental monitoring showing pollution concentration or radiation levels across a region
- Oceanographic charts displaying water temperature or salinity isolines

## Data

- `lat` (numeric) - Latitude coordinates forming a regular grid (-90 to 90)
- `lon` (numeric) - Longitude coordinates forming a regular grid (-180 to 180)
- `value` (numeric) - Continuous variable at each grid point (elevation, temperature, pressure, etc.)
- Size: Grid of 20x20 to 100x100 points covering the geographic region of interest
- Example: Gridded elevation data, weather model output, or interpolated sensor measurements

## Notes

- Overlay smooth contour lines on a geographic basemap (coastlines, borders, or terrain)
- Label contour lines with values at appropriate intervals
- Support both line-only contours and optional filled contours between levels
- Use colormap appropriate to data type (terrain colors for elevation, temperature scales for weather)
- Include a colorbar legend showing the value range
- Ensure contour intervals are meaningful for the data (e.g., 100m for elevation, 4mb for pressure)
