review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic hourly temperature data showing clear cyclical pattern
    (warm midday, cool night)
  - Proper polar chart implementation with clockwise direction and top-starting position
    for time-based data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  - Good canvas utilization with the polar chart filling the space well
  - Correct title format and appropriate radial axis label with units
  weaknesses:
  - The baseline reference circle at r=0 adds unnecessary visual noise and code complexity
  - Grid opacity (0.35) is slightly high; could be more subtle at 0.25-0.3
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover templates
