review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts sliced property and slicedOffset for controlling explosion
    effect
  - Clean, professional visualization with appropriate font sizes for 3600x3600 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between segments
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic market share scenario that demonstrates the purpose of exploded pie
    charts
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Inline Highcharts JS loading for reliable headless Chrome rendering
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor layout imbalance: pie appears slightly left-heavy due to vertical legend
    on right side'
  - Data variation could be more dramatic to better showcase the explosion feature
    contrast
  image_description: 'The plot shows an exploded pie chart titled "pie-exploded ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Market Share by Company". The chart
    displays 6 segments representing different tech companies: TechCorp (35.0%, blue,
    exploded), DataSoft (25.0%, yellow, exploded), CloudNet (18.0%, purple), InnoSys
    (12.0%, cyan), WebScale (7.0%, brown), and CoreLogic (3.0%, pink). The two largest
    segments (TechCorp and DataSoft) are visually separated/exploded from the main
    pie to emphasize the market leaders. Data labels show company names with percentage
    values. A legend is positioned on the right side with all category names and colored
    indicators. The chart uses a white background with clean, professional styling.'
