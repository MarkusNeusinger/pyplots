review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging color scale (blue-yellow-red) that clearly shows low,
    medium, and high performance
  - Value annotations in each cell make the exact scores easily readable
  - Clean, professional layout with proper title format
  - Good realistic data scenario (department performance by quarter)
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical to maintain axis ordering
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis department labels at 45-degree angle could be more readable if horizontal
    or using a different layout
  - White text on yellow cells (mid-range values) has slightly reduced contrast
  - The data does not show any clear patterns or clustering as mentioned in the spec
    notes
  image_description: The heatmap displays a 6×8 matrix showing department performance
    scores by quarter. The x-axis shows 6 departments (Sales, Marketing, R&D, Operations,
    Finance, HR) with labels rotated at 45 degrees. The y-axis shows 8 quarters (Q1-Q8)
    from top to bottom. Each cell contains a numerical score value displayed in bold
    white text. The color scale uses a diverging gradient from blue (low ~20-30) through
    yellow (mid ~50-60) to red (high ~80-90), with a color bar legend on the right
    labeled "Performance Score". The title "heatmap-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Cell values range from approximately 23.4 to 89.6.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_tile and geom_text, scale_fill_gradient2
          for diverging colors, but nothing particularly unique to lets-plot
  verdict: APPROVED
