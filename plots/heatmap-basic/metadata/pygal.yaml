review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom implementation extending pygal Graph class to create heatmap
    functionality not natively available
  - Clear visual hierarchy with readable text at all sizes
  - Good use of colorblind-safe sequential blue colormap
  - Realistic business context with meaningful department performance data
  - Proper colorbar with gradient and labeled scale values
  - Clean cell value annotations with adaptive text color based on background brightness
  - Square canvas format (3600x3600) works well for matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Uses custom class which violates KISS principle (though justified given pygal
    lacks native heatmap support)
  - Colorbar title Score could be more descriptive (e.g., Performance Score (%))
  - No explicit axis titles (could add Department and Quarter labels)
