review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of three distinct density clusters with clear concentric
    contour lines
  - Good use of scatter overlay with low alpha providing context without overwhelming
    the contours
  - Proper ggplot2-style grammar with geom_density2d following lets-plot conventions
  - Axis labels include appropriate units (°C, %) and are descriptive
  - 'Title follows the exact required format: spec-id · library · pyplots.ai'
  - Realistic temperature/humidity scenario with sensible data ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter point alpha could be slightly lower (0.2) for better contour visibility
    in dense areas
