review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair transform_density and row faceting with negative spacing
    to achieve the ridgeline effect
  - Realistic monthly temperature data with appropriate seasonal variation and realistic
    variability patterns
  - Clean color gradient using the blues scheme that naturally emphasizes the seasonal
    progression
  - Perfect title format following spec requirements
  - Well-tuned overlap (-25px spacing) creates visually appealing ridge effect
  - Good font sizing throughout for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines extend across the full width creating slight visual noise on the right
    side where there is no data
  - Grid could be disabled entirely as it does not add value to this visualization
  image_description: The plot displays a ridgeline visualization showing monthly temperature
    distributions for 12 months (January through December). Each month is represented
    as a separate row with a blue area density curve. The ridges use a gradient blue
    color scheme (darker blues for winter months at top, transitioning through the
    year). The curves overlap slightly vertically, creating the characteristic "mountain
    ridge" appearance. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from -14 to 40,
    and each ridge is labeled with its 3-letter month abbreviation on the left. The
    title reads "Monthly Temperature Distribution · ridgeline-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The seasonal temperature pattern is clearly visible - winter months
    (Jan, Feb, Dec) peak around 2-6°C, while summer months (Jun, Jul, Aug) peak around
    22-25°C. Dark blue outlines define each ridge, and the fill has good transparency
    (0.8 opacity).
