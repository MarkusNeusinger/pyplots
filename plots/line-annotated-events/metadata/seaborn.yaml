review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating label heights to prevent overlap with dense events
  - 'Clear visual hierarchy: blue data line, yellow event markers create strong contrast'
  - Comprehensive data generation with realistic trend, seasonality, and noise
  - Proper handling of event markers on the actual data line with scatter points
  - Well-sized text elements for readability at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - No legend or key explaining the event marker style (spec mentions including a
    subtle legend or key)
  - Realistic context score could be higher with more domain-specific context (e.g.,
    actual product category mentioned in labels)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series of daily sales (in units) from
    January 2024 to January 2025. The main line is rendered in Python blue (#306998)
    showing daily fluctuations with an upward trend from ~100 to ~180 units. Five
    yellow vertical dashed lines mark marketing events: Valentine''s Campaign (Feb
    14), Spring Sale (May 1), Summer Launch (Jul 15), Fall Promotion (Sep 20), and
    Black Friday (Nov 25). Each event has a yellow background label with bold text
    positioned at alternating heights (85%/75%) to avoid overlap. Yellow circular
    markers with dark edges appear on the line at each event date. The title uses
    the correct format "{spec-id} · seaborn · pyplots.ai". X-axis shows dates with
    rotated labels, Y-axis shows "Daily Sales (Units)" with clear tick marks. A subtle
    grid is visible in the background.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot correctly, but annotations done via matplotlib
          directly. Seaborn's statistical features not leveraged, though reasonable
          given the spec.
  verdict: APPROVED
