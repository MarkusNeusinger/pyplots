review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of boxen plot concept using Plotly shapes API
  - Clear visual hierarchy with opacity-based quantile differentiation
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all quantile levels
  - Realistic server response time data with varied distributions
  - Clean KISS-style code structure
  - Both PNG and HTML exports included
  weaknesses:
  - Box width decrease is subtle (only 10% per level) - could be more pronounced
  - Outlier markers at size 8 could be slightly larger for better visibility
  - Legend takes significant horizontal space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a boxen (letter-value) plot showing server
    response times across four endpoints: API Gateway, Auth Service, Data Query, and
    File Upload. Each endpoint shows nested boxes in varying shades of blue (darker
    for inner quantiles, lighter for outer quantiles) representing different quantile
    levels (50%, 75%, 87.5%, 93.75%, 96.9%, 98.4%, 99.2%). The median is shown as
    a bright yellow/gold horizontal line across each boxen. Outliers are displayed
    as individual blue scatter points with jitter above and below the box structures.
    The legend on the right clearly explains the quantile levels and median. The title
    follows the correct format "boxen-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai". Axes are well-labeled
    with "Server Endpoint" on X and "Response Time (ms)" on Y. Each distribution shows
    distinct shapes: API Gateway has a heavy tail with outliers around 450-500ms,
    Auth Service is compact with outliers around 150-250ms, Data Query shows a bimodal
    pattern with outliers at both extremes, and File Upload has the widest spread
    reaching 800ms with many outliers.'
