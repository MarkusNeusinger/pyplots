review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram from scratch using Bokeh low-level
    primitives (patch, quad)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-sized text elements and appropriate transparency
    for flows
  - Good use of subtitle to explain the data context and units
  - Proper color coding with colors following source category for intuitive flow tracking
  - Clean KISS-style code with inline Bezier curve calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Interactive features like HoverTool could enhance the Bokeh implementation
  - Legend is positioned far right creating slight visual imbalance
  - Node labels only shown for first and last time points; middle time points could
    benefit from value annotations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic alluvial diagram showing voter migration
    between four political parties (Democratic, Republican, Independent, Other) across
    four election years (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024). The visualization uses:

    - **Colors**: Blue (#306998) for Democratic, Red (#D62728) for Republican, Yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Independent, Gray (#7F7F7F) for Other

    - **Title**: "alluvial-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" centered at top

    - **Subtitle**: "Voter Migration Between Parties (values in millions)" in gray
    below the title

    - **Layout**: Four vertical time columns with rectangular nodes representing party
    sizes, connected by smooth Bezier curve bands showing flow transitions

    - **Labels**: Left side shows starting values (Democratic 42M, Republican 37M,
    Independent 15M, Other 6M), right side shows ending values (Democratic 48M, Republican
    40M, Independent 13M, Other 2M)

    - **Time labels**: Bold year labels (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024) at the bottom

    - **Legend**: Located on the right side showing all four party colors

    - **Flow bands**: Semi-transparent (alpha 0.5) with color matching the source
    category, clearly showing transitions between parties'

        comment: Good use of canvas space; plot is well-centered with appropriate
          margins. Legend placement is functional but creates some asymmetry.

        comment: Uses Bokeh's patch() for flow bands and quad() for nodes effectively.
          Creates custom Bezier curves manually. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific
          features like HoverTool for interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
