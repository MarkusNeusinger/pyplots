review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 75/25 vertical split as specified
  - 'Professional use of Plotly features: unified hover, crosshair spikes spanning
    both panes, shared x-axis'
  - Color scheme is consistent between candlesticks and volume bars for visual coherence
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with volume correlated to price movement magnitude
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Volume axis label lacks units (should be "Volume (shares)" or similar)
  - No legend or annotation explaining that blue=up day, yellow=down day
