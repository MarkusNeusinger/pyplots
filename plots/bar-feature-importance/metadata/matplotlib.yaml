review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, color gradient,
    error bars, and value annotations'
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Professional styling with hidden top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate feature names and importance
    values
  - Good use of Blues colormap for sequential color gradient mapped to importance
    values
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Importance Score (normalized)" or similar)
  - Could leverage matplotlib annotate() for more styled value labels with arrows
    or backgrounds
