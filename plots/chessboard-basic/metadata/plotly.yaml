review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect implementation of chess board pattern with correct h1 light square positioning
  - Excellent use of Plotly shapes API for creating the grid
  - Clean, classic color scheme (cream/brown) with subtle borders
  - Proper 1:1 aspect ratio maintained via scaleanchor
  - Both PNG and HTML output provided
  - Title correctly formatted per spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Could add hover tooltips showing square names (e.g., e4) for enhanced interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a classic 8x8 chess board with alternating
    cream (#F0D9B5) and brown (#B58863) squares. The board uses standard algebraic
    notation with column labels (a-h) along the bottom axis and row labels (1-8) along
    the left axis. The light (cream) square is correctly positioned at h1 (bottom-right
    corner), following chess conventions. Each square has a subtle brown border (#8B7355)
    for enhanced clarity. The title "chessboard-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top. The board maintains a perfect 1:1 aspect ratio with square
    proportions, and the layout is clean with balanced white margins on all sides.
