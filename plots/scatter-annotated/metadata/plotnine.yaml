review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent label placement with nudge_y preventing overlap
  - Clean minimal theme appropriate for annotated scatter plot
  - Well-chosen data spread prevents label collisions
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics syntax
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (add alpha parameter if possible)
  - Point size could be slightly larger for only 10 data points (size=8-10 would be
    more visible)
