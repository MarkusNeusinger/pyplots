quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent isometric projection implementation with proper rotation angles and
    depth-based sizing (painter's algorithm)
  - Floor grid provides outstanding depth perception and spatial context
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate 3D spatial relationships and clustering
    patterns
  - Color encoding via viridis for altitude adds informative fourth dimension
  - Interactive tooltips showing Altitude and Depth values enhance the HTML output
  - Clean code structure with well-commented sections
  weaknesses:
  - Library features score is moderate since lets-plot lacks native 3D support and
    the projection is manually implemented
  - Realistic context could be more specific (e.g., meteorological sensors or geological
    survey points)
