review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with proper layering of geom_path,
    color scales, and theming
  - Color gradient from blue to yellow effectively communicates field strength magnitude
  - Clean integration using scipy solve_ivp for streamline computation produces smooth,
    continuous paths
  - Good visual balance with appropriate line width and alpha for visibility
  - Proper output at scale=3 for high-resolution PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function velocity_field violates KISS principle (should inline the calculation
    or use lambda)
  - Title format adds descriptive prefix instead of using exact spec-id format
  - Could benefit from arrow indicators to show flow direction along streamlines
