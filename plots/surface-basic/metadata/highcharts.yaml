review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis-like colormap implementation that is colorblind-safe
  - Creative wireframe approach using scatter3d with connecting lines creates a visually
    appealing surface effect
  - Good mathematical data showing multiple Gaussian peaks and a central valley
  - Proper 3D perspective with labeled axes
  weaknesses:
  - Surface plot occupies only ~30-35% of the canvas area, leaving excessive whitespace
    especially in the lower portion
  - Missing colorbar to show the value scale as recommended in the specification
  - The wireframe/scatter approach is creative but a true filled surface would better
    match the spec description of continuous surface
