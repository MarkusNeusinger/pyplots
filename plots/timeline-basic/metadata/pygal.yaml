review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating above/below layout prevents text overlap and creates clear
    visual hierarchy
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for timeline visualization
  - Creative SVG injection to add dashed timeline axis as visual anchor
  - Realistic software project milestone data with meaningful categories
  - Color-coded categories with distinct, accessible colors
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical canvas utilization could be improved - timeline occupies narrow horizontal
    band with large empty areas above and below
  - Legend placement at bottom left is distant from the actual data points
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization of software
    project milestones from January to November 2024. Eight events are shown as colored
    dots along a horizontal axis with month labels (Jan through Nov). Events are alternated
    above and below the central timeline: above are "Project Kickoff" (Jan 15), "Architecture
    Design" (Mar 20), "Alpha Release" (Jun 15), and "User Acceptance" (Sep 10); below
    are "Requirements Complete" (Feb 10), "Development Start" (Apr 25), "Beta Release"
    (Aug 01), and "Production Launch" (Oct 20). Each event is labeled with its name
    and date. Colors represent categories: blue for Planning, yellow for Design, teal
    for Development, red/coral for Testing, and light blue for Deployment. A legend
    at the bottom left shows all five categories. The title reads "Software Project
    Milestones · timeline-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
