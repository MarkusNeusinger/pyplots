review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn boxplot with notch parameter and proper API (hue with
    legend=False)
  - Realistic salary data scenario that naturally demonstrates notch interpretation
  - Clear visual differentiation between departments with accessible color palette
  - Thoughtful annotation explaining notch interpretation for educational value
  - Properly formatted y-axis with dollar values and K suffix for readability
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid/legend scoring ambiguity: no legend present but this is correct for the
    plot type'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a notched box plot showing salary distributions
    across 5 departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, HR). Each box uses
    a distinct color: Engineering (blue #306998), Marketing (yellow #FFD43B), Sales
    (teal #4ECDC4), Support (coral #E07A5F), and HR (sage green #81B29A). The notches
    around each median are clearly visible, with the Sales box having particularly
    wide notches due to its larger spread. The title "box-notched · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. The y-axis shows "Annual Salary ($)" with values formatted
    as $40K-$160K, and the x-axis shows "Department". A subtle grid with dashed lines
    helps read values. Outliers are visible as gray circles, particularly prominent
    in Sales (3 high outliers around $130K-$155K) and a few in Marketing and Support.
    An italic annotation in the bottom-right explains the meaning of notches. The
    layout is well-balanced with good margins.'
