review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics
    primitives
  - Smooth cubic interpolation creates visually appealing curved flow bands
  - Smart filtering of very small flows (<3 voters) improves clarity without losing
    important transitions
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Proper use of transparency (alpha=0.5) for overlapping flows
  - Clean layout with party labels on both sides for easy reading
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced proportions
  weaknesses:
  - Data is deterministic so no seed needed, but explicit data definition could use
    a comment explaining the voter transition matrix
  - Small flows between 2016-2018 are less visible compared to later periods
