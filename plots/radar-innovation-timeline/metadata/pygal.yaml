review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic technology data with plausible ring assignments reflecting
    actual industry positioning (Kubernetes to Adopt, Quantum Networking to Hold)
  - Clean, clever angular slot system that distributes innovations within each sector
    with proper gaps between sectors
  - 'Strong pygal-specific feature usage: major/minor x-label separation, radar inner_radius,
    dual PNG+HTML output, custom y_labels with label/value dicts'
  - Colorblind-safe four-color palette with strong contrast between all sectors
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation labels around the perimeter follow radial rotation, making labels in
    the Cloud and Infra (left), Sustainability (bottom), and Biotech and Health (right)
    sectors nearly sideways or upside-down, severely impacting readability for roughly
    75% of the labels
  - Concentric ring boundaries are faint dotted lines without visual emphasis — adding
    subtle background fills or stronger ring demarcation would improve the time-horizon
    visual hierarchy
  - Design is technically correct but visually generic — lacks distinctive visual
    impact (e.g., ring shading, sector boundary styling, or emphasis on near-term
    vs. long-term items) to elevate beyond a well-configured default
  image_description: 'The plot shows a full 360-degree radar/spider chart titled "radar-innovation-timeline
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" centered on a light gray background. Four thematic sectors
    are positioned at cardinal directions: "AI & ML" (top), "Cloud & Infra" (left),
    "Sustainability" (bottom), and "Biotech & Health" (right). Concentric rings represent
    time horizons labeled "Adopt" (innermost), "Trial", "Assess", and "Hold" (outermost),
    drawn as faint dotted circular gridlines. Twenty-four innovation items are plotted
    as colored dots: blue for AI & ML, amber/orange for Cloud & Infra, teal for Sustainability,
    and purple for Biotech & Health. Individual innovation names appear as rotated
    labels around the perimeter following their angular positions — labels near the
    top are upright and readable, but labels on the left, bottom, and right sides
    are rotated 90-270 degrees, making many nearly sideways or upside-down and difficult
    to read. A legend at the bottom shows all four sector colors in a single row.
    The chart fills the square canvas reasonably well with balanced margins.'

        comment: Font sizes explicitly set (title 48, labels 20, major 28, legend
