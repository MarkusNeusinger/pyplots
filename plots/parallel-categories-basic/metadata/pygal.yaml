review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent parallel categories visualization with clear flow ribbons connecting
    four dimensions
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each product category
  - Well-proportioned ribbons showing customer journey flows with appropriate opacity
  - Clean layout with dimension labels at top and category labels positioned outside
    bars
  - Realistic e-commerce scenario with plausible purchase journey data
  weaknesses:
  - Middle dimension category labels (Channel, Payment) are positioned below bars
    but could overlap with ribbons in denser visualizations
  - Cancelled outcome label at bottom right is quite small and harder to read than
    other labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel categories diagram with four vertical
    dimensions: Category, Channel, Payment, and Outcome. The Category dimension on
    the left shows four stacked colored bars (Electronics in blue, Clothing in yellow,
    Home & Garden in teal, Sports in coral). Curved ribbons flow from each category
    through the middle dimensions (Channel showing Online/Store/Mobile App; Payment
    showing Credit Card/Debit Card/Digital Wallet) to the Outcome dimension on the
    right (Completed/Returned/Cancelled). The ribbons are semi-transparent and colored
    by their source category, allowing visual tracking of customer purchase journeys.
    The title "parallel-categories-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    center. A legend at the bottom shows the four category colors, with an italic
    subtitle describing the visualization.'

        comment: Creatively uses pygal's XY chart as base and builds custom SVG elements.
          Shows deep understanding of pygal's SVG rendering but relies heavily on
          manual SVG construction
  verdict: APPROVED
