review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with proper encoding types (T, Q,
    N)
  - Perfect streamgraph implementation using stack='center' for the centered baseline
    aesthetic
  - Beautiful smooth curves achieved with basis interpolation
  - Realistic music streaming scenario with seasonal variation and growth trends
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate hiding of y-axis tick labels for streamgraph aesthetic while keeping
    descriptive axis title
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for all 6 genres
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis shows "Streaming Hours (millions)" title but no tick values, which creates
    slight visual inconsistency - consider removing y-axis title entirely or adding
    back subtle tick values
  - Legend could benefit from being integrated into the plot (e.g., direct labels
    on streams) rather than separate legend box
  - Color palette uses Python Blue/Yellow prominently but Jazz (purple) and Classical
    (orange) could be slightly more saturated for better visibility against adjacent
    areas
