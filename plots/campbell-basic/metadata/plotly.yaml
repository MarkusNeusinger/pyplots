review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    output
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual separation between mode curves and engine
    order lines
  - Critical speed markers with white-edged red diamonds are visually distinctive
    and immediately draw attention
  - Interactive features (hovertemplate with mode x EO cross-reference, HTML export)
    leverage Plotly strengths
  - Realistic rotordynamic scenario with plausible mode names and frequency ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Engine order labels 2x and 3x are not visible in the rendered static image — they
    are placed at coordinates outside or at the edge of the visible area
  - All four natural frequency mode curves use identical solid line style despite
    line_dashes being defined — using distinct dash patterns would improve visual
    distinction
  - The line_dashes variable is defined but serves no purpose since all values are
    solid — dead configuration
  - Critical speed shaded bands are nearly invisible at alpha 0.04 — increasing to
    0.08-0.12 would make them meaningful
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with "campbell-basic ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" as the centered title. The X-axis reads "Rotational Speed
    (RPM)" ranging from 0 to 6000, and the Y-axis reads "Frequency (Hz)" from 0 to
    110. Four natural frequency mode curves are plotted as solid lines: 1st Bending
    (dark blue, gently rising from ~18 Hz), 2nd Bending (green, gradually declining
    from ~43 Hz), 1st Torsional (purple, nearly flat at ~55 Hz), and Axial (orange,
    declining from ~73 Hz). Three dashed gray engine order lines (EO 1x, EO 2x, EO
    3x) extend diagonally from the origin. The "1x" label is visible at the upper-right
    portion of the plot, but the "2x" and "3x" labels appear to be cut off or outside
    the visible axis range. Red diamond markers with white edges indicate critical
    speed intersections (approximately 10-12 markers). Very faint vertical shaded
    bands appear around critical speeds. A legend in the top-left corner lists all
    series clearly. The background is light gray (#F8F9FA) with a white plot area
    and very subtle gridlines.'
