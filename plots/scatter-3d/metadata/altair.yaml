review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D-to-2D isometric projection using mathematical rotation matrices
  - Creative use of opacity encoding for depth perception (Y mapped to transparency)
  - Proper painters algorithm via order encoding for correct point layering
  - Clean code with clear comments explaining projection math
  - 'Good use of Altair declarative features: selection_interval for pan/zoom, tooltips
    showing original X/Y/Z'
  - White strokes on points improve visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label text is confusing - states Z-axis (Y encodes depth via opacity) when
    the visual axis should be labeled more simply
  - Legend uses absolute positioning (legendX=1300) which may not adapt to different
    display sizes
  - Subtitle is quite long and technical for a gallery example
