review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hand-drawn world map basemap using matplotlib Polygon patches - creative
    solution without external geo libraries
  - Clean dual-legend implementation with proper sizing reference for population
  - Good color scheme with regional differentiation and colorblind-safe palette
  - Well-formatted title following the spec convention
  - Appropriate transparency and edge highlighting on markers
  weaknesses:
  - Grid legend styling could be improved - graticule lines are adequate but legend
    placement creates minor visual imbalance
  - Some population figures are slightly outdated
  - Could leverage matplotlib built-in geographic projections or Basemap/Cartopy for
    more accurate coastlines
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a world map with a light blue ocean background (#C8DDF0) and gray/beige continental landmasses (#E5E5E0) outlined by manually drawn polygon coastlines in dark gray (#888888). Scattered across the map are 25 colored circular markers representing major world cities, positioned by their latitude/longitude coordinates. The markers vary in size (encoding population from approximately 5 million to 37 million people) and color (encoding geographic region): dark blue (#306998) for Asia, yellow (#FFD43B) for Europe, red-orange (#E24A33) for North America, light blue (#348ABD) for South America, green (#8EBA42) for Africa, and purple (#988ED5) for Oceania.

    The title "World's Largest Cities by Population · scatter-map-geographic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top (fontsize 22). The x-axis shows "Longitude (°)" ranging from -180 to 180, and the y-axis shows "Latitude (°)" ranging from -60 to 80, both with fontsize 20 labels. Tick labels are set at fontsize 16.

    Two legends are present: a "Region" legend in the lower-left corner with colored patches for each of the six continents, and a "Population" size legend in the lower-right showing reference circles for 10M, 20M, and 35M populations. Both legends have framealpha=0.95 and are styled with rounded edges (fancybox=True).

    A subtle dotted graticule grid overlays the map at 30° intervals in both latitude and longitude, rendered in gray (#AAAAAA) at alpha=0.6 with linewidth=0.4. The markers have white edge colors with linewidth=2.5 and alpha=0.8 for good visibility. The overall layout is 16:9 aspect ratio (figsize 16x9) with tight_layout applied.
