review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed layout algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold)
    with proper cooling schedule
  - Clear visual separation of the three community clusters demonstrating the algorithm
    effectiveness
  - Node size scaling by degree provides additional insight into node importance
  - Good color palette with Python Blue as primary, distinguishable and accessible
    colors
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with appropriate theming (removed axes,
    grid for clean network visualization)
  - Realistic social network scenario with meaningful team names
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned somewhat far from the main graph content, could be placed closer
  - No edge weight visualization (all edges same thickness despite spec mentioning
    optional weight)
  - HTML export could leverage lets-plot interactive features (tooltips showing node/edge
    info)
