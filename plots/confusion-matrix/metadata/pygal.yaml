review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper colorbar, cell annotations, and diagonal highlighting
  - Creative solution to implement confusion matrix in pygal which lacks native heatmap
    support
  - Proper contrast handling for text on varying background colors
  - Good use of sequential blue colormap matching the specification requirements
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with meaningful class confusion patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Uses custom class extending pygal.graph.graph.Graph which deviates from KISS principle
    (though necessary for pygal)
  - Imports from internal module (pygal.graph.graph) rather than public API
  - The sys.path manipulation for import is a workaround that adds complexity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 confusion matrix heatmap for a sentiment
    analysis classifier with classes: Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Mixed. The
    matrix uses a sequential blue colormap ranging from very light blue (#f7fbff)
    for low values to dark blue (#08306b) for high values. The title "confusion-matrix
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. "True Label" is shown on the y-axis
    (left side, rotated), "Predicted Label" on the x-axis (bottom). Class labels are
    displayed on both axes - row labels on the left and column labels rotated 45°
    at the bottom. Each cell contains the count value with white text on dark cells
    and dark text on light cells. A colorbar on the right shows the scale from 5 to
    142 with a "Count" title. The diagonal cells (correct predictions) have a subtle
    blue border highlighting them. The layout is clean and well-balanced on a square
    canvas.'
