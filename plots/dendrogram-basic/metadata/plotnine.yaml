review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy dendrogram() with no_plot=True to extract coordinates,
    then rendering with plotnine native geom_segment
  - Clean two-color scheme using Python branding colors that distinguishes high-level
    from low-level merges
  - Proper 45-degree label rotation prevents overlap while maintaining readability
  - Well-structured code following KISS principle with clear data generation for three
    iris species
  - Appropriate figure sizing (16x9) and font scaling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarify the distance metric more explicitly
  - The color threshold logic (0.7 * max) is somewhat arbitrary and unexplained visually
  - Bottom margin has extra whitespace due to rotated labels extending into the plot
    area
