review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized task labels and bars
  - Perfect color coding by category with Python-themed blue/yellow for first two
    categories
  - Professional layout with proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700
  - Realistic software development project data showing overlapping and sequential
    tasks
  - Clean datetime handling with proper x-axis formatting
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for task details on hover (Bokeh key interactive feature)
  - Generates both PNG and HTML but only PNG is required
  - Axis label Timeline could be more descriptive
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart for a software development project
    with 12 tasks arranged vertically. Task names appear on the left side (Requirements
    Analysis, System Design, Database Schema, Backend API, Frontend UI, Unit Testing,
    Integration, Documentation, System Testing, User Acceptance, Deployment, Training).
    Horizontal bars span from each task''s start to end date. The x-axis shows "Timeline"
    with dates from Jan 2025 to Apr 2025. Tasks are color-coded by category: blue
    (Planning - 2 tasks), yellow/gold (Development - 4 tasks), green (Testing - 3
    tasks), and red (Deployment - 3 tasks). A legend on the right side shows the four
    categories. The title reads "gantt-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai". The background
    is light gray (#fafafa), bars have dark outlines, and vertical dashed grid lines
    mark time intervals.'
