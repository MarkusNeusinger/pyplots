review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper fill effect emphasizing magnitude
  - Good custom style configuration with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Realistic website traffic data with seasonal patterns
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Semi-transparent fill (opacity=0.4) makes the visualization effective
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement is awkward - appears in top-left corner outside the main plot
    area
  - Dots are functional but could be slightly larger for better visibility at full
    resolution
  - Could leverage pygal interpolation feature for smoother curves
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart showing monthly website
    traffic over 12 months (January to December). The chart uses Python Blue (#306998)
    for both the line and the semi-transparent fill area beneath it. The title "line-filled
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The X-axis is labeled "Month" with
    abbreviated month names (Jan through Dec), and the Y-axis is labeled "Page Views"
    with values ranging from approximately 41,000 to 64,000. Small dots mark each
    data point. The fill area effectively emphasizes the magnitude of values, showing
    a seasonal pattern with a summer peak in July (~63,000) and a holiday spike in
    December (~64,000). A legend reading "Website Traffic" appears in the top-left
    corner. Horizontal grid lines are present and subtle.
