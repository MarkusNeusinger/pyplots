review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of error bars using pygal XY chart despite lack of native
    error bar support
  - Properly demonstrates asymmetric error bars (Treatment C and D)
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled font sizes for the canvas
  - Realistic scientific context with control and treatment groups
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace in lower portion of
    plot (data ranges ~23-55)
  - Error bar caps could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
  - Does not leverage pygal interactive features (tooltips showing exact values would
    enhance the visualization)
