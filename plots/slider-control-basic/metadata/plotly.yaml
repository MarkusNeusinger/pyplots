review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly slider component with well-configured steps and currentvalue
    display
  - Clean, professional visual design with properly sized fonts and good color choice
  - Realistic business scenario (quarterly sales) that demonstrates the slider year-filtering
    capability
  - Dynamic title updates when slider changes year
  - Helpful annotation text guiding users to interact with the slider
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too faint (alpha=0.1 effectively invisible) - should be more visible
    (alpha 0.2-0.3)
  - Spec mentions play/pause animation option if supported - Plotly supports this
    but it was not implemented
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart showing "Quarterly Sales Performance
    · 2019" with the subtitle "slider-control-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai". Four blue
    bars (#306998) represent Q1-Q4 sales data with values labeled above each bar ($107K,
    $146K, $161K, $143K). The Y-axis shows "Sales ($ Thousands)" ranging from 0-250,
    and the X-axis shows "Quarter" with labels Q1-Q4. Below the main chart is a horizontal
    slider widget with year labels from 2019 to 2024, showing "Year: 2019" as the
    current selection. The slider has a circular handle on 2019 and tick marks for
    each year. The background is white with a clean, professional appearance.'

        comment: Good use of Plotly's slider widget with currentvalue display, update
          method, and styled slider. Could have included animation/play button for
          extra credit.
  verdict: APPROVED
