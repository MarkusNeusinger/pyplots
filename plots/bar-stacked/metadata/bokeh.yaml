review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled font sizes for the 4800×2700
    canvas
  - Clean stacking implementation with white borders between segments for clarity
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and HoverTool for interactivity
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with distinct hues
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful data variation across quarters
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left slightly crowds the upper y-axis tick labels
  - Missing total value labels above each stack (mentioned in spec notes as consideration)
  - Data is hardcoded rather than using random generation with seed
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly sales
    data (Q1-Q4) with four product categories stacked vertically: Electronics (dark
    blue at bottom), Clothing (golden yellow), Home & Garden (teal/turquoise), and
    Sports (coral/salmon at top). The title "bar-stacked · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left. The y-axis shows "Sales (thousands USD)" ranging from 0 to 500,
    and the x-axis shows "Quarter" with Q1-Q4 labels. A legend in the top-left corner
    identifies all four categories. The bars show a clear upward trend in total sales
    across quarters, with Q1 at ~315K, Q2 at ~405K, Q3 at ~430K, and Q4 at ~475K.
    White separator lines between stacked segments enhance readability. The grid uses
    subtle dashed horizontal lines.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with custom tooltips, Legend with
          LegendItem customization. Good use of Bokeh features but could leverage
          more (e.g., LabelSet for totals).
  verdict: APPROVED
