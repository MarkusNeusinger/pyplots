review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of the spec with all required features: sorted bars,
    error bars, color gradient, and x=0 reference line'
  - Uses real scikit-learn wine dataset with actual permutation importance calculation
  - Proper seaborn 0.14+ API usage with hue parameter to apply palette
  - Text sizing follows guidelines perfectly (24/20/16pt)
  - Viridis palette provides excellent colorblind accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars added via matplotlib errorbar rather than exploring seaborn native
    error bar capabilities in barplot
  - Grid uses dashed style which is slightly more visually distracting than solid
    with low alpha
  image_description: 'The plot is a horizontal bar chart displaying permutation feature
    importance for 13 wine dataset features. The chart uses a viridis color palette
    ranging from bright yellow-green (highest importance: proline at ~0.05) to dark
    teal/green (lower importance features). Features are sorted by importance with
    "proline" at the top, followed by "color_intensity", "flavanoids", and "alcohol"
    showing visible bars with importance values. The remaining 9 features (od280/od315_of_diluted_wines
    through malic_acid) show effectively zero importance with no visible bars. Each
    bar has horizontal error bars (black with caps) showing variability. There''s
    a subtle vertical reference line at x=0 and dashed grid lines on the x-axis. The
    title reads "bar-permutation-importance · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in large font.
    Axis labels are clear: "Mean Importance (Decrease in Accuracy)" on x-axis and
    "Feature" on y-axis.'
