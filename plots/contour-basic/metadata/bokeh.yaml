review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of contourpy library for generating filled contours and contour
    lines, demonstrating sophisticated polygon extraction
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent accessibility and visual appeal
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs are generated, supporting Bokeh interactive capabilities
  - Clean implementation with proper handling of ChunkCombinedOffset fill type from
    contourpy
  - Appropriate 50x50 grid resolution provides smooth contour curves
  - Good axis range with buffer prevents edge clipping
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar title Z Value appears partially clipped at the right edge of the image
  - Grid lines are barely visible against the dark purple background of low-value
    regions
  - Axis labels use generic X Coordinate / Y Coordinate instead of a domain-specific
    context
  image_description: The plot displays a contour visualization of a 2D scalar field
    with a Gaussian peak function. The main peak is centered around (0, 0) with a
    secondary, smaller peak visible around (1.5, -1). The filled contours use the
    Viridis colormap (colorblind-safe) transitioning from dark purple/blue (low values
    ~0.05) through teal/cyan to green and finally bright yellow (high values ~0.95).
    Contour lines in dark gray overlay the filled regions. The title "contour-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. X and Y axes are labeled "X Coordinate"
    and "Y Coordinate" respectively, with tick marks from -3 to 3. A colorbar on the
    right shows the Z Value scale from ~0.05 to ~0.95. The overall layout is clean
    with a light gray background and subtle grid lines.

        comment: Uses Bokeh's patches and multi_line glyphs appropriately; uses contourpy
          for contour generation which is standard. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific
          features like HoverTool for interactivity in the HTML version.
