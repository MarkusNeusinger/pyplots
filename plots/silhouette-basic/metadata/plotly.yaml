review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and properly sorted bars within
    each cluster
  - Correct implementation of silhouette plot with all required features from the
    spec
  - Good use of colorblind-safe color palette with strong visual contrast
  - Proper use of Iris dataset as a realistic, educational example
  - Clean, reproducible code following KISS principles
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be better positioned to avoid proximity to the average
    line annotation
  - Missing negative silhouette values in the visualization which would better demonstrate
    the full range of the metric
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover data
    showing sample indices
