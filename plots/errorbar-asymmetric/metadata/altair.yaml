review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered chart composition to build error bars from primitives
    (rule + tick marks)
  - Clear asymmetric error demonstration with visually distinct upper/lower bounds
    across products
  - Proper tooltip implementation showing all relevant values (central, lower, upper
    bounds)
  - Perfect title format and descriptive axis labels with context
  - Good color scheme using Python official colors with high contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Data scenario could be more specific (e.g., Manufacturing Batch Quality) rather
    than generic Product A-F
  - Could leverage Altair selection/highlight features for enhanced interactivity
