review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent heteroscedasticity visualization that demonstrates a key diagnostic
    pattern (variance increasing with fitted values)
  - Well-implemented smoothed trend line using moving average to detect non-linear
    patterns
  - Clean, publication-quality appearance with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Custom hover templates enhance interactive exploration of individual residuals
  - Proper y-axis range symmetric around zero for visual balance
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Fitted Values (units)" would be more informative)
  - Could leverage more Plotly interactive features like range sliders for zooming
    into specific regions or spike lines for precise value reading
  - Marker size (14) slightly large for 150 points - could be reduced to 10-12 for
    cleaner appearance
