review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly and appropriately set
  - Viridis colormap mapping exam scores to color adds a meaningful visual dimension
    beyond basic scatter
  - 'Clean visual refinement: spine removal, subtle dashed grid, white marker edges,
    well-proportioned layout'
  - Realistic, neutral educational data context with plausible values
  - Perfect KISS code structure with fixed seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the positive correlation and ceiling effect at 100% are
    visible but not highlighted with annotations, a trend line, or callouts'
  - Marker size (s=80) could be increased to s=100-120 for better visual impact at
    this data density
  - Layout balance is slightly off — the colorbar adds right-side asymmetry and there
    is unused space in the lower-right area
  - Could leverage more distinctive matplotlib features to push library mastery score
    higher
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot of 120 data points showing the
    relationship between "Study Hours (per week)" (x-axis, range ~1–12) and "Exam
    Score (%)" (y-axis, range ~40–100). Each point is colored using the viridis colormap
    mapped to its exam score value, transitioning from dark purple (low scores ~40%)
    to yellow (high scores ~100%). A vertical colorbar on the right edge shows this
    color-to-score mapping. The data shows a clear positive correlation—students who
    study more tend to score higher—with natural scatter/noise. A ceiling effect is
    visible as several high-study-hour points cluster at 100%. The title reads "scatter-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in medium weight. Top and right spines are removed.
    Subtle dashed grid lines (alpha ~0.2) aid value estimation. Markers have white
    edge highlights (linewidth 0.5) which gives them a polished, separated appearance.
    All text is clearly legible with explicit font sizes.
