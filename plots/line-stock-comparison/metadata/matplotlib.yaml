review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the rebasing normalization to 100
  - Realistic stock simulation using geometric Brownian motion with appropriate drift
    and volatility parameters
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good color choices that are distinguishable and accessible
  - Proper use of axhline for reference line at 100
  - Grid styling with appropriate alpha for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend includes Start (100) entry which clutters it - the reference line is self-explanatory
    from the y-axis label
  - Line width of 2.5 is acceptable but could be 3 for optimal visibility at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Could use matplotlib.dates formatters for more control over x-axis date formatting
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-line chart comparing four financial
    series (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, SPY) normalized to a starting value of 100. The chart
    spans from January 2024 to January 2025. Four distinct colored lines represent
    each symbol: blue for AAPL, red for GOOGL, teal for MSFT, and yellow for SPY.
    A horizontal dashed gray reference line at y=100 marks the starting point. The
    legend is positioned in the upper left corner, clearly identifying each series
    plus the "Start (100)" reference line. The Y-axis is labeled "Rebased Value (Start
    = 100)" and the X-axis shows "Date" with monthly tick marks. All lines show realistic
    stock-like volatility with SPY (yellow) significantly outperforming, reaching
    ~160 by end of period, while MSFT (teal) underperforms, ending around 85. AAPL
    and GOOGL finish around 110-120. The grid is subtle with dashed lines.'
