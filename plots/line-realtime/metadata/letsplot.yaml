review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of real-time monitoring concept with clear current
    value annotation
  - Well-implemented fade effect indication with text annotation and threshold reference
    lines
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar including multiple geom layers
  - Professional color scheme with accessible colors (blue line, yellow highlight,
    red threshold)
  - Proper figure sizing with scale=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses letsplot instead of lets-plot - should match the official library name
    format
  - The point alpha gradient (fade effect) is implemented but barely visible in the
    output; the text annotation helps but actual visual fade would be stronger
  - Grid alpha at 0.5 could be more subtle (0.2-0.3 recommended)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitoring chart with
    a blue line (#306998) showing oscillating CPU usage between approximately 10%
    and 70% over 100 time samples. The chart features a light blue area fill beneath
    the line for visual depth. A prominent yellow circular marker highlights the latest
    data point on the right edge showing "Current: 33.8%". A red dashed horizontal
    line at 80% indicates a "Warning threshold" with red text label. A gray dotted
    line at 50% serves as a reference. The left side includes a gray annotation "←
    older data fades" indicating the streaming direction. The title "line-realtime
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis shows "Time (samples at
    100ms interval)" from 0-100, and the y-axis shows "CPU Usage (%)" from 0-100.
    The chart uses a minimal theme with a clean white background and subtle gray grid
    lines.'

        comment: Good use of ggplot2 grammar with geom_line, geom_area, geom_point,

          export for interactivity; -1 for not using more advanced lets-plot specific
          features like tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
