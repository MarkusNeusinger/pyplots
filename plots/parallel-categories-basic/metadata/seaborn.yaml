review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice using seaborn colorblind palette
  - Clear flow visualization with well-proportioned ribbons (alpha=0.55 works well)
  - Smart label placement strategy (left/right alternating) avoids most overlaps
  - Titanic-style data is a perfect educational example for parallel categories
  - Professional styling with sns.set_context(talk) for readable fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib patches rather than seaborn native plotting functions
    (seaborn lacks native parallel categories support so this is acceptable but limits
    LF score)
  - The survival probability calculation loop adds code complexity that could be simplified
    with vectorized operations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel categories diagram with 5 categorical
    dimensions: Class (First, Second, Third), Sex (Female, Male), Age Group (Child,
    Adult, Senior), Embarked (Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown), and Outcome (Survived,
    Lost). Each dimension is represented by vertical dark gray bars with white labels
    placed outside. The ribbons connecting categories are colored using a colorblind-safe
    palette: blue for First Class, orange/gold for Second Class, and teal/turquoise
    for Third Class. The ribbons flow from left to right showing how observations
    move through categories. The title "parallel-categories-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in large bold text. A legend at the bottom shows the three
    class colors. The dimension headers are displayed in teal color above each vertical
    bar. The overall layout is clean with good use of whitespace and no clipping.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_style, sns.set_context, and sns.color_palette effectively;
          however, the core visualization is built with matplotlib patches rather
          than native seaborn plots (seaborn doesn't have native parallel categories
          support)
  verdict: APPROVED
