review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot using Highcharts SVGRenderer API for custom
    geometry
  - Interactive tooltips showing node details (label, axis type, connection count)
  - Well-designed legend with both Module Types and Edge Weight visual guide
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between axes
  - Curved Bezier edges with weight-based thickness provide clear visual hierarchy
  - Central hub element adds visual coherence to the radial layout
  - Node labels positioned intelligently based on axis angle to avoid overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python library as recommended in library rules (uses
    raw JS generation instead)
  - Code could benefit from an explicit comment noting deterministic data for reproducibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hive plot visualization of a software module
    dependency network. Three radial axes extend from a central gray hub: "Core" (blue,
    pointing upward), "Utility" (yellow, pointing to lower-right), and "Interface"
    (purple, pointing to lower-left). Each axis has 4 labeled nodes (Core: Main, Engine,
    Database, Auth; Utility: Logger, Config, Cache, Format; Interface: API, Web, CLI,
    WebSocket). Curved edges connect nodes between axes, with edge thickness representing
    dependency weight. The plot uses a colorblind-safe palette (blue #306998, yellow
    #FFD43B, purple #9467BD). A legend in the upper-right shows Module Types with
    colored circles and Edge Weight with line thickness examples. The title "hive-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. White background with good contrast.'
