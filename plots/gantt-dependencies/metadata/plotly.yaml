review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical organization with group summary bars and indented child
    tasks
  - Clear dependency visualization using dotted connector lines
  - Good color palette distinguishing project phases
  - Rich hover information showing task details and duration
  - Proper finish-to-start dependency representation as specified
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Dependency lines are somewhat faint (0.5 opacity) and could be more visible
  - Y-axis index-based referencing for shapes may cause alignment issues with categorical
    axis
  image_description: 'The plot shows a Gantt chart displaying a software development
    project timeline from March to May 2024. Tasks are organized hierarchically by
    project phases: Requirements (blue), Design (yellow), Development (teal), Testing
    (coral/red), and Deployment (light green). Each phase has a summary bar at the
    top (with a down arrow prefix) showing the overall phase duration, followed by
    indented individual tasks. Dependency arrows are drawn as dotted gray lines connecting
    the end of predecessor tasks to the start of successor tasks, indicating finish-to-start
    relationships. The chart has a centered title "gantt-dependencies · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    at the top, a horizontal legend showing "Project Phases" with color swatches below
    the title, a timeline x-axis labeled "Timeline (2024)" with weekly tick marks
    (angled at 45 degrees), and a dependency legend annotation at the bottom right.
    Task names are clearly readable on the left side.'
