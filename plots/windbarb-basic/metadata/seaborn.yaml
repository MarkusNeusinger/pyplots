review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing throughout
  - Good use of colorblind-safe viridis colormap for wind speed
  - Proper meteorological context with longitude/latitude labels
  - Clean grid layout prevents barb overlap
  - Correct title format per spec requirements
  - Code is clean, reproducible, and follows KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Calm wind circles (speed < 2.5 kt) not visible in the rendered image despite code
    implementation - the circles may be too small or not rendering
  - Pennants (50 knot triangular flags) not clearly visible despite code setting up
    strong wind conditions - these are a key feature of wind barb notation
  - Bottom legend text (Barb notation) appears to be cut off or not visible in the
    final render
  - Colorbar range shows 5-30+ but code sets clim=(0, 70) - mismatch between data
    and colorbar range
  image_description: The plot displays a wind barb visualization on a 16:9 canvas
    with a white background. The barbs are arranged in a grid pattern covering approximately
    8x6 positions across the plot area. The title "windbarb-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in black text. The x-axis is labeled "Longitude (°E)" and the
    y-axis "Latitude (°N)", both with appropriate degree symbols. A colorbar on the
    right shows "Wind Speed (knots)" ranging from approximately 5 to 30+ knots, using
    a yellow-to-red colormap (sequential). The barbs display varying orientations
    and lengths indicating different wind directions and speeds. Barbs with half barbs
    (5 knots) and full barbs (10 knots) are visible throughout the grid. The overall
    layout is clean with good spacing between barbs preventing overlap. However, calm
    wind circles are not visible in the image despite the code implementing them,
    and pennants (50 knot flags) are also not clearly present despite code attempting
    to generate strong winds.
