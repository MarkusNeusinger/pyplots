review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Tissot indicatrices concept to demonstrate projection
    distortion
  - Good color scheme with blue landmasses and yellow indicatrices for contrast
  - Clean graticule implementation with dashed lines at appropriate intervals
  - Proper use of coord_map() for map projection
  - Educational caption explaining the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output
  - Only shows single projection (Mercator) instead of comparing multiple projections
    as spec suggests
  - Continent shapes are overly simplified polygons that do not accurately represent
    real geography
  - Tissot indicatrices should show more obvious elliptical distortion at high latitudes
    but appear as circles
  - Missing Antarctica which is a significant landmass
  image_description: The plot shows a world map with simplified continent outlines
    (blue polygons) and Tissot indicatrices (yellow/gold circles) on a light blue
    background. The continents are rendered as schematic polygons representing North
    America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The Tissot indicatrices
    are displayed as circles at regular latitude/longitude intervals (-60° to +60°
    lat, -150° to +150° lon). At higher latitudes (±60°), the circles appear larger/stretched
    compared to equatorial circles, demonstrating Mercator projection distortion.
    Graticule lines (dashed gray) are visible at 30° latitude intervals and 60° longitude
    intervals. The title "map-projections · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is at the top,
    with "Longitude" on the x-axis and "Latitude" on the y-axis. A caption at the
    bottom explains the Tissot indicatrices. The legend appears to be missing from
    the visible area.
