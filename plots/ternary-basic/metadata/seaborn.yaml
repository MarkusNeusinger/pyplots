review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinate transformation with clean vectorized
    NumPy code
  - Professional appearance with well-designed grid lines at 10% intervals and tick
    marks at 20% intervals
  - Realistic soil composition scenario using Dirichlet distribution for authentic
    compositional data
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid, talk context) and sns.scatterplot for
    the data points
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=200) and transparency (alpha=0.7) for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; the heavy lifting is done with matplotlib
    primitives
  - Grid legend not present (minor issue for single-series data)
  - Square figure (12x12) instead of recommended 16:9 landscape, though appropriate
    for ternary plots
