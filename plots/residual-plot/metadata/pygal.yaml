review:
  strengths:
  - Proper separation of normal residuals and outliers with distinct colors
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of custom Style for canvas sizing and fonts
  - Realistic house price prediction scenario with heteroscedasticity
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good dot sizing for the data density (100 points)
  weaknesses:
  - 'X-axis values render incorrectly: code specifies fitted values 150-500 but plot
    shows 10-100 (pygal may be using index positions)'
  - Axis labels lose their units in rendering (should show $1000s suffix)
  - The ±2σ threshold dashed lines are not visible in the rendered output despite
    being added to the chart
  - 'Legend label mismatch: Zero Reference rendered vs y = 0 (Perfect Fit) in code'
