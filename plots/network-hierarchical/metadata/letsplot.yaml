quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent tree layout algorithm that properly centers parents over children
  - Clean implementation of hierarchical positioning without external dependencies
    like NetworkX
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with layer composition (segments, points,
    text)
  - 'Appropriate visual encoding: node size decreases by level, distinct colors per
    level'
  - Well-balanced canvas utilization and professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes descriptive prefix rather than pure spec-id format (minor)
  - Helper functions deviate slightly from KISS principle, though justified for layout
    complexity
  image_description: The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart for a tech
    company with 30 employees across 4 management levels. The visualization uses a
    tree layout with the CEO at the top (large blue node), followed by 3 VPs in the
    second level (yellow nodes), 8 managers in the third level (green nodes), and
    18 individual contributors at the bottom (orange nodes). Each node displays a
    short label (CEO, VP Eng, VP Sales, VP Ops, Mgr FE, Dev 1, etc.). Gray edges connect
    parent nodes to child nodes showing the reporting relationships. The legend on
    the right side clearly identifies each level (Executive, VP, Manager, Staff) with
    corresponding colors. The title "Tech Company Org Chart · network-hierarchical
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The plot has a clean white background
    with no axis lines, ticks, or grid, appropriate for this network visualization.
