review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required features implemented including optional
    operating range shading'
  - Strong data storytelling through visual differentiation of critical speeds inside
    vs. outside operating range (diamond vs. circle markers, opacity contrast, labeled
    annotations)
  - Realistic rotordynamics data with physically plausible mode behaviors and frequencies
  - Clean visual design with removed spines, subtle grid, and custom color palette
  - Well-constructed custom legend that clearly explains all 9 element types
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is large (9 items) and positioned in the upper-left corner where it covers
    some data area; could use a more compact layout or external positioning
  - Annotation labels for critical speeds inside the operating range are close together,
    particularly 1st Torsional and Axial around 58-65 Hz at 3500-4000 RPM
  - Code complexity could be slightly reduced in the intersection-finding and annotation-spreading
    sections
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with 5 natural frequency
    mode curves plotted against rotational speed (0-6000 RPM) on the x-axis and frequency
    (0-120 Hz) on the y-axis. The mode curves are: 1st Bending (dark blue, rising
    gently then leveling), 2nd Bending (orange, declining slightly), 1st Torsional
    (cyan, nearly flat around 58 Hz), Axial (purple, declining), and 3rd Bending (brown,
    rising then flattening). Three gray dashed engine order lines (1x, 2x, 3x) radiate
    from the origin with rotated labels. Critical speed intersections outside the
    operating range are shown as semi-transparent red circles (about 10 markers),
    while intersections inside the operating range (2500-4500 RPM, shaded light blue
    with dotted vertical boundaries) are displayed as large red diamond markers with
    labeled annotations connected by thin lines (2nd Bending, 3rd Bending, 1st Torsional,
    Axial). An italic "Operating Range" label sits near the bottom of the shaded region.
    A comprehensive legend in the upper left lists all 9 element types. Top and right
    spines are removed, subtle grid lines are present, and the title reads "campbell-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
