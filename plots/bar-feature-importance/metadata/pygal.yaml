review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal per-bar color styling with gradient mapped to importance
    values
  - Clean visual design with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correct sorting with highest importance at top (pygal renders bottom-to-top, code
    handles this)
  - Value annotations positioned clearly at end of each bar with 3 decimal precision
  - Realistic house price prediction context using recognizable feature names
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function importance_to_color which deviates from strict KISS
    script style
  - X-axis could be tighter to data range to reduce unused whitespace on right side
