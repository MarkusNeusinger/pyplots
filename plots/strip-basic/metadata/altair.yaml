review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair transform_calculate for implementing random jitter effect
  - Clean layering approach combining strip chart with mean reference lines
  - Good color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and contrasting yellow mean markers
  - Proper use of configure_axis and configure_view for styling
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful variation between departments
  weaknesses:
  - Mean reference markers lack a legend or annotation explaining what they represent
  - X-axis category labels could benefit from horizontal orientation for better readability
  - Y-axis scale extends significantly below data range (down to 10 when minimum data
    is ~35)
