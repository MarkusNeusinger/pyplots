review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color choice with blue/yellow distinction for significance - highly
    accessible
  - Proper horizontal layout with variables on y-axis for readability of long names
  - Clean sorting by coefficient magnitude for easy comparison
  - Clear zero reference line for significance assessment
  - Good use of custom style for consistent sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Zero Reference line appears in legend as a dot rather than showing dashed line
    style, creating visual inconsistency
  - Confidence intervals added as separate None-labeled series creates many legend-less
    series in the SVG structure
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot with confidence
    intervals for a housing price regression model. Ten predictor variables are shown
    on the y-axis (from bottom to top: Age of Home, Distance to City Center, Crime
    Rate Index, Property Tax Rate, Number of Bedrooms, Garage Size, School Rating,
    Number of Bathrooms, Lot Size, Square Footage), ordered by coefficient magnitude.
    Coefficient estimates are shown as points on the x-axis (ranging from -0.6 to
    0.7), with horizontal lines extending left and right indicating 95% confidence
    intervals. Blue dots and lines represent statistically significant coefficients
    (p < 0.05), while yellow/gold dots and lines indicate non-significant coefficients.
    A vertical dashed gray line at x=0 serves as the zero reference line for significance
    assessment. The title reads "coefficient-confidence · pygal · pyplots.ai" and
    the x-axis is labeled "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)". A legend at the bottom
    shows three categories: Significant (p < 0.05), Not Significant, and Zero Reference.
    The plot uses a clean white background with subtle gray gridlines.'
