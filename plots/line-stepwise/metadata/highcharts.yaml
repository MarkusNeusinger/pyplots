review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of step line using Highcharts native step: left option'
  - Realistic and relevant data scenario (server response time monitoring)
  - Clear step pattern showing discrete value changes throughout the day
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Good use of subtitle for additional context
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Saves both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Image dimensions slightly off (2561 vs 2700 height)
  - Legend could be slightly larger for better visibility at high resolution
  - Could utilize more Highcharts-specific interactive features like custom tooltips
