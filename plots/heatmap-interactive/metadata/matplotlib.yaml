review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with adaptive text colors for annotations
  - Clean, professional appearance with viridis colormap
  - Realistic server performance monitoring scenario
  - Good code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800×2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - 'Missing core interactivity: The spec explicitly requires hover tooltips showing
    row/column/value, zoom/pan capabilities, and a reset button. The implementation
    is entirely static with no interactive features.'
  - 'No matplotlib event handling: Could have used mpl_connect for hover events, widgets
    for zoom controls, or saved as HTML with mpld3 for browser interactivity'
  - 'Grid lines are slightly distracting: White grid with alpha=0.4 is too prominent
    for a heatmap'
  image_description: The plot displays a 12×12 heatmap showing server CPU load percentages
    across 12 servers (Server 01-12 on Y-axis) and 12 time periods (06:00-17:00 on
    X-axis). The colormap uses viridis (dark purple for low values ~0%, transitioning
    through blue/teal/green to bright yellow for high values ~100%). Each cell contains
    a bold numeric annotation showing the exact CPU load percentage (0-100 range).
    Text color is adaptive - white on dark cells (low values) and black on bright
    cells (high values). The title "heatmap-interactive · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    is clearly displayed at the top. A vertical colorbar on the right shows "CPU Load
    (%)" with scale from 0 to 100. X-axis labels are rotated 45° for readability.
    Subtle white grid lines separate cells. The data shows a realistic pattern with
    higher loads during mid-day business hours (10:00-12:00) and lower loads in early
    morning and late afternoon.
