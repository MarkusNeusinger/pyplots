review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of SHAP summary plot matching specification requirements
  - Effective use of Altair declarative syntax with proper encoding types (Q for quantitative,
    N for nominal)
  - Good jittering implementation using transform_calculate for random vertical offsets
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate color scheme (blueorange) matching SHAP convention of low=blue, high=red/orange
  - Features properly sorted by mean absolute SHAP value (importance)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning could be closer to the plot area to reduce isolation
  - Grid styling is minimal - could add subtle horizontal grid lines to help trace
    feature rows
  - Interactive features not utilized (no tooltips or zoom/pan) which is an Altair
    strength
