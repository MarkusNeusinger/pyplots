review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements pygal Funnel chart with proper segment proportions
  - Uses custom Style with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Value labels clearly displayed within each segment with proper formatting (comma
    separator)
  - Distinct colors for each stage matching pyplots color scheme
  - Clean, minimal code structure following KISS principles
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned at bottom-left with significant empty space below the funnel,
    could be better integrated
  - Font sizes in the library rules suggest smaller values (28 for title), but implementation
    uses 48 - this works but deviates from guidelines
  - Could leverage more pygal-specific features like tooltips or custom value formatting
    with percentages
