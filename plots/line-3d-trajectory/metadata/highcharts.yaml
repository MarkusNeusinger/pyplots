review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of the Lorenz attractor as a chaotic system example, perfectly
    matching the spec suggestion
  - Good 3D visualization with proper depth perception through frame panels
  - Clean and readable code with proper inline JavaScript embedding for headless Chrome
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  - Appropriate line width and marker sizing for the trajectory
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function lorenz_attractor() which deviates from the KISS
    structure guideline
  - Missing color gradient to show time progression along the trajectory (spec mentions
    this as an optional but valuable feature)
  - The 3D plot could utilize more canvas area - the effective plot area is somewhat
    small relative to margins
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3D visualization of the Lorenz Attractor chaotic system. The trajectory is rendered as a connected blue line (#306998) in 3D space, showing the characteristic butterfly-shaped double-lobe pattern of the Lorenz system. The plot includes:
    - A main title "Lorenz Attractor · line-3d-trajectory · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top with a subtitle "Chaotic trajectory visualization in 3D phase space"
    - Three labeled axes: X Position (horizontal), Y Position (vertical), Z Position (depth)
    - Semi-transparent blue frame panels on the bottom, back, and side for 3D depth perception
    - A legend on the right showing "Lorenz Trajectory"
    - Grid lines on all three planes with subtle styling
    - The trajectory clearly shows the spiraling motion between the two attractors
    - White background with good contrast
    - The 3D perspective (alpha=20°, beta=30°) provides a clear view of the trajectory structure
