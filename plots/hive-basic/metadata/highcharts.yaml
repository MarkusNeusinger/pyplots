review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of software module dependency scenario that perfectly fits the
    hive plot use case
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Well-positioned curved edges using quadratic Bezier curves that create visual
    flow
  - Proper 3-axis layout matching specification requirements
  - Node labels are well-positioned to avoid overlapping with the plot elements
  weaknesses:
  - Uses custom SVG rendering instead of Highcharts native chart features (only loads
    Highcharts.js but does not use it)
  - Contains a helper function get_node_coords() which violates the KISS code structure
    requirement
  - Plot only occupies upper portion of canvas, leaving significant whitespace at
    bottom
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" not "Software Dependencies
    · hive-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
  - Legend labels ("Core Modules") do not match axis labels ("Core") - should be consistent
