review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with layer composition
  - Clear visual distinction between historical (solid blue) and forecast (dashed
    orange)
  - Properly nested confidence bands with appropriate opacity (0.2 for 95%, 0.35 for
    80%)
  - Widening confidence intervals correctly represent increasing uncertainty over
    forecast horizon
  - Clean separation of data preparation and chart construction
  - Uses resolve_scale to handle multiple legend groups elegantly
  - Appropriate Y-scale domain avoids wasted space at zero
  weaknesses:
  - The separate Confidence and Series legends, while technically correct, create
    slight visual redundancy
  - Could use tooltips for interactivity since Altair supports them natively
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series forecast with uncertainty bands
    for monthly sales data. The historical period (2021-2024) is shown as a solid
    blue line (#306998) tracking sales from approximately 105 to 170 thousand USD
    with visible seasonal patterns. A vertical dashed gray line marks the forecast
    start at January 2024. The forecast period (2024-2025) shows an orange dashed
    line (#E67E22) projecting sales from around 170 to 210 thousand USD. Two nested
    shaded bands in yellow (#FFD43B) represent confidence intervals: the lighter outer
    band (20% opacity) for 95% CI and a darker inner band (35% opacity) for 80% CI.
    The bands widen appropriately over the forecast horizon. The title follows the
    correct format "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty · altair · pyplots.ai" with a
    subtitle. Legends on the right clearly identify Series (Historical, Forecast)
    and Confidence (95% CI, 80% CI). Axes are well-labeled with "Date" and "Sales
    (thousands USD)".'
