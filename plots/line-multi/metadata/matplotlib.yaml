review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data diversity showing three distinct patterns: steady growth, mid-year
    dip/recovery, and exponential growth'
  - Perfect text sizing following matplotlib.md guidelines (title 24pt, labels 20pt,
    ticks 16pt)
  - Appropriate use of distinct line styles (solid, dashed, dash-dot) combined with
    different markers (circle, square, triangle) for triple differentiation
  - Clean KISS code structure with realistic business context
  - Well-balanced layout with legend placement that does not obscure data
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like fill_between for confidence
    intervals, annotations for key data points, or secondary y-axis for percentage
    change
  - Yellow color (#FFD43B) may be slightly difficult to distinguish from white background
    in some viewing conditions
