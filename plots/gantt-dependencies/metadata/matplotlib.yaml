review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dependency visualization using FancyArrowPatch with curved connectionstyle
  - Clear visual hierarchy with phase summary bars (darker, smaller) vs individual
    tasks (lighter, taller)
  - Task indentation in Y-axis labels clearly shows parent-child relationships
  - Color scheme effectively distinguishes 4 phases while remaining colorblind-friendly
  - Comprehensive data example covering multiple dependency types (single and multiple
    dependencies)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Dependency legend uses annotation text instead of being integrated into the legend
    handles
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., Date instead of Timeline)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal Gantt chart showing a software
    development project timeline spanning from January to late April 2024. The chart
    contains 18 tasks organized into 4 phases: Requirements Phase (blue), Design Phase
    (yellow), Development Phase (green), and Testing Phase (pink/magenta). Phase summary
    bars are shown with darker colors and black borders, while individual child tasks
    are indented in the Y-axis labels and displayed with lighter colors. Dependency
    arrows connect related tasks using curved gray lines with arrowheads, showing
    finish-to-start relationships between tasks. The X-axis shows dates in "Mon DD"
    format with bi-weekly intervals. A legend in the upper right explains the phase
    colors, with a separate "→ Dependency" annotation. The title follows the correct
    format: "gantt-dependencies · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
