review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three annotation labels (Top Performer, Widest
    Spread, outlier count) rendered via Highcharts renderer API
  - 'All spec requirements fully satisfied: median, outliers, whiskers at 1.5xIQR,
    distinct category colors'
  - 'Professional visual refinement: dotted grid, removed spines/ticks, semi-transparent
    fills, bold median emphasis'
  - 'Outstanding data quality: 5 departments with meaningfully different distributions
    showcasing all box plot features'
  - Strong font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas — all text clearly readable
  weaknesses:
  - The fillColor injection via string replacement (box_data_api_js to box_data_with_fill)
    is a code smell — a pragmatic workaround but adds fragility
  - Y-axis extends to 105 creating slight excess whitespace above the data range
  - Color palette is functional but not fully harmonious — the yellow/brown/cyan combination
    could be more cohesive
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots on a light gray (#fafafa)
    background, one for each department: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales
    (purple), Design (cyan), and Finance (brown). Each box has a semi-transparent
    fill with a solid border in the corresponding color. Bold dark median lines are
    visible within each box. Whiskers extend with horizontal caps, and red circular
    outlier markers (with darker red borders) are scattered at extreme values. The
    title "box-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large bold font,
    with a lighter subtitle "Annual Performance Review Scores by Department" below
    it. The Y-axis reads "Score (out of 100)" with a dotted grid at 5-point intervals,
    and the X-axis reads "Department." Three annotation boxes provide data storytelling:
    a green-bordered "Top Performer" box (top-left) identifying Design with median
    81, an orange-bordered "Widest Spread" box (top-right) identifying Finance with
    IQR 21 pts, and a red-bordered "5 outliers detected" box (bottom-left) noting
    scores beyond 1.5xIQR. The layout is well-proportioned with the plot filling most
    of the canvas.'
