review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing and readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean legend placement on right side avoids overlap with data
  - Good use of varying line styles (solid/dashed) for additional differentiation
  - Markers at data points improve readability for sparse data
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern idiomatic to Bokeh
  - Month labels using major_label_overrides for readability
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend glyph rendering appears small/inconsistent in PNG output
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive exploration of data points
  - Cyan and blue colors could be more distinct for accessibility
