review:
  strengths:
  - Statistics (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) are calculated and displayed
  - Tail regions beyond 2 standard deviations highlighted with distinct red color
  - Good use of density normalization for histogram
  - Clean code structure with manual statistics calculations
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) and font configuration
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Missing normal distribution overlay curve - spec requires overlay for comparison
  - Statistics should be in a separate text box, not embedded in title
  - Legend placement overlaps/crowds the x-axis title area
  - X-axis tick labels are rotated and some are empty, making scale harder to read
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart histogram of daily returns distribution
    rendered in pygal. The histogram shows approximately 30 bins with blue bars representing
    returns within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and red/coral bars representing
    tail regions beyond ±2σ. The distribution appears roughly bell-shaped and centered
    near 0%, with the tallest bar (around 37 on the y-axis) near the center. The title
    at the top includes statistics: Mean: 0.044%, Std: 1.451%, Skew: 0.30, Kurt: 0.62,
    followed by the proper format "histogram-returns-distribution · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    The x-axis is labeled "Returns (%)" with rotated tick labels showing percentage
    values like -3.72, -2.19, -0.48, 1.14, 2.75, 4.37. The y-axis is labeled "Frequency
    (Density × 100)". A legend at the bottom shows "Returns" (blue) and "Tails (>2σ)"
    (red). Notably, there is no normal distribution overlay curve present, which is
    a required feature per the specification.'
