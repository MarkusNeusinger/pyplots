review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn sns.ecdfplot for the core visualization, making the code
    idiomatic and concise
  - 'Strong data storytelling: shaded divergence band, dashed max-distance line, and
    stat annotation box immediately guide the viewer to the key insight'
  - Polished visual design with custom facecolor, subtle grid, spine removal, and
    colorblind-safe palette
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario with appropriate sample sizes and score ranges
  - 'All spec requirements fully implemented: both ECDFs, K-S statistic, max divergence
    highlight, p-value, clear legend, Y-axis 0-1'
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has dead space in the lower-left quadrant where both CDFs are near zero
    — tightening x-limits or adjusting the figure could improve canvas utilization
  - The legend linestyle manipulation code (matching by color) is fragile and could
    break if seaborn changes internals
  - The max distance italic label at 12pt is small relative to other text elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) comparing credit score distributions for "Good Customers" (blue solid
    line, #1B6B93) and "Bad Customers" (orange dashed line, #D35400) on a light off-white
    background (#FAFBFC). The X-axis shows "Credit Score (points)" ranging from approximately
    350 to 850, and the Y-axis shows "Cumulative Proportion" from 0.0 to 1.0. A vertical
    dashed black line at approximately score 595 marks the point of maximum divergence
    between the two distributions, with two black dots (white-edged) at the intersection
    points on each CDF. A subtle orange shaded band highlights the region of divergence
    around the maximum point. An annotation box in the upper-right area displays "K-S
    Statistic = 0.463" and "p-value = 9.69e-24" in bold text within a rounded light-gray
    box, connected to the upper divergence point by an arrow. A small italic "max
    distance" label appears near the divergence line. The legend in the upper-left
    corner shows both groups with their respective line styles. The title reads "Credit
    Score Distributions · ks-test-comparison · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Top and right
    spines are removed, with a subtle y-axis grid.'
