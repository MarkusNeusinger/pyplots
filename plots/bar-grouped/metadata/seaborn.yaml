review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn's native barplot with hue parameter for clean grouped
    bars
  - Clear, realistic business data scenario with meaningful quarterly growth patterns
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper left partially overlaps with Q1 bars; consider placing
    outside plot or in upper right
