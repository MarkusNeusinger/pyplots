review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features with CustomJS callbacks for view toggling
  - Well-implemented inline squarify algorithm for treemap layout
  - Clean sunburst implementation using patches with proper angular calculations
  - Realistic company budget data with clear hierarchy
  - Both HTML (interactive) and PNG (static) outputs provided
  - Good color distinction between departments and sub-departments
  - Legend properly shows department categories
  weaknesses:
  - PNG export only shows treemap view - cannot demonstrate toggle functionality which
    is core spec requirement
  - Legend shows only 4 department colors, not the distinct sub-department colors
    used in treemap
  - Some similar green/teal shades for Marketing sub-departments reduce distinguishability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a treemap visualization of company budget
    allocation with 13 sub-department rectangles across 4 main departments. Each rectangle''s
    area is proportional to its budget value. Colors distinguish departments: Engineering
    sub-departments (Backend in steel blue $1500K, Frontend in coral red $1200K, DevOps
    in teal $800K, QA in yellow $600K), Marketing (Digital in light orange $900K,
    Content in teal $700K, Analytics in green $500K), Operations (Logistics in orange
    $1100K, Facilities in light orange $600K, Procurement in dark orange $450K), and
    HR (Benefits in purple $300K, Recruiting in lavender $400K, Training in purple
    $350K). The title "hierarchy-toggle-view · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at top
    left in blue. A department legend is positioned on the right. Labels show department
    names in bold with budget values below. The static PNG shows only the treemap
    view; the sunburst view is available via toggle buttons in the HTML export.'
