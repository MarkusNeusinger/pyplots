review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to construct wind rose wedges without
    native polar coordinate support
  - Clean color progression from cool (blue) to warm (orange) following meteorological
    convention
  - Well-designed custom legend with proper units (m/s) positioned cleanly in bottom-right
  - Correct orientation with North at top as per meteorological standards
  - Realistic coastal weather station scenario with authentic prevailing SW wind pattern
  - Good use of categorical speed bins matching specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Frequency percentage labels (5%, 10%, 15%) could be larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - Missing Frequency (%) label on the radial axis to explain what the gridlines represent
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with more whitespace on the right side than left
