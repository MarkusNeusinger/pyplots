review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of bimodal distribution to demonstrate density histogram capabilities
  - Perfect combination of histplot (stat="density") and kdeplot - showcases seaborn
    statistical visualization strength
  - Clean color scheme with high contrast blue/yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper canvas utilization with 16:9 aspect ratio
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate bin count (25) for the data size (500 points)
  weaknesses:
  - KDE line is slightly thick (linewidth=4) which could overshadow the histogram
    bars in some areas
  image_description: The plot displays a density histogram of test scores using blue
    bars (#306998) with white edges. The histogram shows a clear bimodal distribution
    with peaks around 65 and 85 points, representing two student groups. A yellow/golden
    KDE curve (Kernel Density Estimate) smoothly overlays the histogram, tracing the
    density pattern. The title reads "histogram-density · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in
    large font at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score (points)" and the y-axis
    "Probability Density". A legend in the upper left identifies the KDE curve and
    Density Histogram. The plot has a subtle dashed grid and uses a clean 16:9 layout
    with good canvas utilization.
