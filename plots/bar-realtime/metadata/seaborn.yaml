review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of real-time data with ghosted previous values
    showing transition
  - Colorblind-friendly color scheme using blue/orange from the scientific color palette
  - Motion lines effectively suggest animation in a static image
  - LIVE indicator with timestamp adds authenticity to the real-time concept
  - Clear value labels with percentage change indicators
  weaknesses:
  - Legend patch styling does not perfectly match the actual bars (legend shows solid
    patches but bars have edge highlighting)
  - DataFrames are created but barely utilized - the hue parameter usage is somewhat
    forced
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time updating bar chart showing server
    metrics (requests per second) for 6 services: API Gateway, Auth Service, Database,
    Cache, Worker Queue, and CDN. Each service has two overlaid bars - a ghosted/transparent
    light blue bar showing the "Previous State" and a solid darker blue bar showing
    the "Current State". Above each bar, the current value is displayed in bold (e.g.,
    847, 623, 512, etc.), along with a change indicator showing percentage change
    with colored arrows (blue upward arrows for increases like +6.9%, orange downward
    arrows for decreases like -5.3%). The plot has horizontal motion lines across
    bars to suggest animation/transition. A red "LIVE" indicator with timestamp "Last
    update: 0.8s ago" appears in the upper left. A legend in the upper right distinguishes
    Previous State from Current State. The title follows the required format: "bar-realtime
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
