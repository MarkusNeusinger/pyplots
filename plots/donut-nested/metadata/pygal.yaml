review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution to achieve nested donut effect in pygal by compositing
    two separate pie charts
  - Consistent color families per department (blue, yellow, green, red) exactly as
    spec recommends
  - Professional budget allocation scenario that is immediately relatable
  - Values displayed with proper currency formatting ($XXK)
  - Generates both PNG static and HTML interactive versions
  - Title follows exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is somewhat small and could be larger for better readability
  - The PIL compositing approach adds code complexity that could benefit from comments
    explaining the technique
