review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the SMA indicator chart with all required periods
    (20, 50, 200)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Proper datetime axis handling with business day frequency
  - Distinct colors for each line that are accessible and easy to distinguish
  - Correctly demonstrates the SMA 200 delayed start (only appears after 200 periods)
  - Well-formatted title following the required pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears smaller than specified in code when rendered, could be more
    prominent
  - Close price line could be slightly thicker for better visibility on the large
    canvas
  - Missing HoverTool for showing exact values on mouseover, which is a distinctive
    Bokeh feature
  - Could benefit from showing more obvious golden cross/death cross signals in the
    generated data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Simple Moving Average (SMA) chart with a
    blue close price line showing significant volatility, overlaid with three SMA
    lines: yellow (SMA 20), red (SMA 50), and green (SMA 200). The chart spans from
    January 2024 to March 2025, with prices ranging from approximately $85 to $118.
    The price starts around $100, dips to ~$86 in mid-2024, then rallies to ~$118
    by late 2024 before settling around $110. The SMA 200 (green) only appears after
    day 200, demonstrating the delayed start due to the calculation window. The title
    "indicator-sma · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left. The legend is positioned
    in the top-left corner showing all four series. Grid lines are subtle with dashed
    styling. Background is light gray (#FAFAFA).'
