review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of rose chart using Bokeh wedge glyph with correct angle
    calculations
  - Clean seasonal pattern visualization with meaningful color coding (blue for wet
    months, yellow for dry)
  - Well-proportioned layout with chart filling canvas appropriately
  - Subtle gridlines (dashed, alpha 0.3) aid value estimation without visual clutter
  - Proper start position at top (12 o clock) as recommended in spec for time data
  weaknesses:
  - Scale labels show percentages rather than actual rainfall values in mm which would
    be more informative
  - Month label for Dec appears slightly inside the wedge rather than outside like
    other labels
  image_description: The plot displays a rose chart (coxcomb/Nightingale diagram)
    showing monthly rainfall data. The chart is circular with 12 wedges representing
    each month (Jan-Dec) arranged clockwise starting from January at the top. The
    wedge radii are proportional to rainfall values, with December and January showing
    the largest petals (highest rainfall), while July shows the smallest (lowest rainfall).
    Colors transition from Python Blue (#306998 and variants) for higher values to
    Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for lower values (June, July, August visible in yellow).
    Month labels are positioned around the outside. Concentric dashed gray circles
    serve as gridlines at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% levels. The title "Monthly Rainfall
    · rose-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Scale labels (25%, 50%,
    75%, 100%) are positioned on the right side. The overall layout is clean with
    a white background.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, wedge glyph, and proper Bokeh figure configuration;
          could leverage more interactive features but PNG output limits this
