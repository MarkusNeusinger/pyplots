review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all features from the specification are implemented
    including 270° layout, concentric ring fills, sector spokes, and labeled data
    points
  - Strong data storytelling through size and alpha hierarchy that naturally draws
    the eye to Adopt items first
  - Realistic, well-chosen technology data that mirrors a real ThoughtWorks-style
    Technology Radar
  - Clean visual design with removed axes, subtle gray boundaries, and pastel ring
    fills creating meaningful color progression
  - Good grammar-of-graphics layer composition using plotnine idiomatically
  weaknesses:
  - Label overlap in crowded areas — particularly Federated Learning / Neural Arch.
    Search in AI & ML sector, and RT Feature Stores / Data Contracts in Data Engineering;
    inner Adopt ring is also crowded
  - Significant whitespace at the bottom of the canvas (~30%) is underutilized; the
    legend feels somewhat isolated
  - Innovation label font size (8) is on the small side for comfortable reading
  - Blue (#306998) and purple (#7B4DAA) sector colors could be more distinct for colorblind
    accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-quarter circle (270°) innovation radar
    chart opening downward. Four concentric rings represent time horizons: "Adopt"
    (innermost, green-tinted), "Trial" (yellow-tinted), "Assess" (orange-tinted),
    and "Hold" (outermost, pink-tinted). Four angular sectors divide the chart: "Data
    Engineering" (upper-left), "Cloud & Infra" (upper-right), "Security" (lower-left),
    and "AI & ML" (lower-right). Each sector is separated by gray spoke lines, and
    ring boundaries are drawn as gray arcs. 26 technology items are plotted as colored
    dots — blue for AI & ML, green for Cloud & Infra, orange for Data Engineering,
    and purple for Security. Point sizes decrease from inner to outer rings (Adopt=largest,
    Hold=smallest), and alpha transparency similarly decreases, creating a visual
    hierarchy emphasizing near-term items. Each dot has a text label in its sector
    color. Ring names appear in bold gray text at the bottom center of the open gap.
    Sector headers are bold black text at the outer edge. A "Category" legend with
    four colored circles sits in the lower-right area. The title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in bold, with an italic subtitle
    explaining the ring semantics. The background is white.'
