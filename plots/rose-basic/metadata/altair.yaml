review:
  strengths:
  - Proper rose chart implementation with radial segments where radius represents
    values
  - Colorblind-friendly distinct color palette for all 12 months
  - Radial gridlines at 25/50/75/100 mm with labels for scale reference
  - Value labels positioned intelligently to avoid crowding on smaller segments
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Chart occupies only upper-left quadrant of canvas leaving excessive whitespace
    in lower portion
  - Month labels missing from outer edge - only values shown without category context
    on chart itself
  - Legend placed far to the right isolated from the chart rather than integrated
