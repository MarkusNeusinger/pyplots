review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native gauge indicator (go.Indicator) with proper mode=gauge+number
  - Clean implementation of threshold-based color zones (red/yellow/green) matching
    spec exactly
  - Prominent value display with large font size (72pt) for immediate readability
  - Proper title format with spec-id and attribution in subtitle
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive use
  - Professional color scheme using Python blue (#306998) for indicator and borders
  weaknesses:
  - Red/yellow/green color scheme may not be fully accessible to colorblind users;
    consider adding patterns or alternative color palette
