review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the spec with clear event annotations using axvline
    and annotate
  - Smart use of alternating heights to prevent annotation overlap
  - Professional styling with white background boxes and arrow connections
  - Realistic stock price data with quarterly earnings context
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entry for Event Marker uses alpha=0 trick which creates an invisible line
    in the legend - consider using a Line2D proxy artist instead
  - Could utilize more distinctive matplotlib features like ConnectionPatch for arrows
    or custom box styles
