review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation algorithm using Union-Find ensures connected maze structure
  - Clean visual appearance with appropriate wall thickness and colors
  - Good contrast between walls, background, and markers
  - Entry and goal are clearly marked with intuitive visual indicators
  - Print-friendly black walls on white background as spec requires
  weaknesses:
  - 'KISS violation: Uses a UnionFind class and helper function (cell_id) instead
    of flat script structure'
  - Seaborn is only used for styling (set_style, set_context) not for actual plotting
    - borderline AR-05 issue
  - Spec requires exactly one solvable path but difficulty setting adds extra passages
    creating multiple paths
  - No legend explaining what the START marker and center star represent
  - 12x12 square figure size instead of 16x9 landscape or 1:1 3600x3600 format
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze with 7 concentric rings divided
    into 12 sectors. The maze features dark gray (#1a1a1a) walls on a clean white
    background with consistent wall thickness. At the center is a blue (#306998) filled
    circle containing a yellow (#FFD43B) star symbol marking the goal. On the outer
    edge (right side), there is a blue circular marker with "START" label indicating
    the entry point. A visible gap in the outer boundary wall creates the entry passage.
    The maze structure shows algorithmically generated passages connecting adjacent
    rings and sectors, creating navigable pathways from the start to the center goal.
