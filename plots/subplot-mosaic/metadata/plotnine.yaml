review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine composition operators (| and /) to create mosaic-like
    layout
  - Clean, consistent color scheme using blue/yellow palette throughout all panels
  - Good visual hierarchy with larger overview panel and smaller detail panels
  - Well-structured code with clear separation of data generation and plotting
  - Appropriate use of diverse geoms (geom_line, geom_point, geom_bar, geom_tile,
    geom_text)
  - Professional theming with customized text sizes for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Heatmap colorbar legend is placed at the very bottom of the figure, visually separated
    from its panel
  - Title uses suptitle which works but could be more integrated with plotnine native
    theme system
  - Could demonstrate the mosaic empty cell feature mentioned in the spec using placeholder
    characters
