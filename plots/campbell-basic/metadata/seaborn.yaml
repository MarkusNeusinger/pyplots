review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent engineering data context with realistic rotordynamics terminology and
    plausible frequency/RPM ranges
  - Smart critical speed intersection detection using sign-change analysis with linear
    interpolation for precision
  - Well-placed engine order labels with white background boxes preventing visual
    clutter
  - Clean custom color palette that is colorblind-safe and visually harmonious
  - Proper title format and comprehensive legend with all modes and critical speed
    markers
  weaknesses:
  - 'Data storytelling is weak: critical speed markers are all identical with no emphasis
    on which intersections are most dangerous or relevant to an operating range —
    consider adding an operating range band or using marker size/color to encode proximity
    to operating conditions'
  - Y-axis extends to 110 Hz but highest mode barely reaches 95 Hz, wasting vertical
    space and reducing data-ink ratio — tighten the y-axis limits or add content to
    fill the space
  - Engine order lines could be slightly more prominent (increase alpha or linewidth)
    to better show the diagnostic grid pattern
  - Mode labels only appear in the legend rather than directly on curves, making it
    harder to identify modes without cross-referencing — consider direct annotation
    near curve endpoints
  - Seaborn usage is minimal — most of the heavy lifting is done by matplotlib, leaving
    limited seaborn-specific value
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with 5 natural frequency
    curves plotted against rotational speed (0-6000 RPM) on the x-axis and frequency
    (0-110 Hz) on the y-axis. The modes are: 1st Bending (blue, ~18-22 Hz), 2nd Bending
    (orange, ~43-39 Hz, slightly decreasing), 1st Torsional (green, ~55-62 Hz, increasing),
    Axial (purple, ~72-70 Hz, nearly flat), and 3rd Bending (cyan, ~90-94 Hz, increasing).
    Three dashed gray engine order lines (1x, 2x, 3x) radiate from the origin with
    labels in white-boxed text. Red circular markers with white edges highlight approximately
    15 critical speed intersections where engine order lines cross natural frequency
    curves. Top and right spines are removed, subtle grid lines are present with differentiated
    alpha values for x and y axes, and the legend is positioned in the lower right
    in a 2-column layout. Title reads "campbell-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
