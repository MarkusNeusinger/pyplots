review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent vortex flow visualization with concentric circular streamlines that
    clearly demonstrate field topology
  - Effective color gradient (blue to yellow) encoding flow speed with values increasing
    toward the outer regions
  - Arrow markers positioned along streamlines clearly indicate counter-clockwise
    flow direction
  - Well-balanced 1:1 aspect ratio canvas that perfectly suits circular streamline
    patterns
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_path for streamlines and geom_point
    for directional arrows
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more descriptive context (e.g., meters, arbitrary
    units)
