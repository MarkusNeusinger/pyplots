review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of seaborn heatmap to render pixel-based maze grid
  - Kruskal's algorithm guarantees exactly one solution path
  - Clear entry/exit markers with professional styling (rounded box, contrasting colors)
  - Legend provides clear explanation of maze symbols
  - Reproducible maze generation with fixed seed
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for circular maze design
  weaknesses:
  - Walls appear slightly pixelated due to 200x200 grid resolution; higher resolution
    would improve smoothness
  - Seaborn usage is minimal - primarily using heatmap as image renderer rather than
    leveraging seaborn's statistical features
  - Some whitespace imbalance with legend placement creating asymmetry
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circular maze puzzle rendered using seaborn''s
    heatmap function. The maze consists of 7 concentric rings with 12 sectors each,
    shown as dark gray/black walls (value ~0.1) on a light gray/white background (value
    ~0.95). A golden star (★) marks the goal at the center, surrounded by a darker
    gray circular area. The entry point is marked with a blue circle (#306998) on
    the right side of the outer boundary, accompanied by a "START" label in a white
    rounded box with blue border. A legend in the lower-left corner explains the markers:
    blue circle for "Entry Point" and gold star for "Goal (Center)". The title "maze-circular
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. The maze has clear
    opening passages and walls following Kruskal''s algorithm ensuring exactly one
    solution. The overall layout is square (12x12 inches) with the maze well-centered.'

        comment: Uses seaborn's heatmap function which is appropriate for grid-based
          visualization; however, this is primarily a matplotlib visualization wrapped
          in seaborn heatmap rather than leveraging seaborn's statistical visualization
