review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout using gggrid with proper 70/30 height ratio
  - Colorblind-safe blue/orange palette applied consistently to both candlesticks
    and volume bars
  - Clean KISS code structure with good data generation for realistic price movements
  - Proper use of geom_segment for both wicks and bodies creates recognizable candlesticks
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is cut off on the right edge, truncating Down Day text
  - No crosshair or cursor spanning both panes as mentioned in the specification
  - Volume axis uses scientific notation which is less intuitive than formatted numbers
