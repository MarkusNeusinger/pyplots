review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and perceptual
    uniformity
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper layering (ggplot + geom +
    scale + labs + theme)
  - Well-structured data with meaningful spatial temperature gradient pattern
  - Comprehensive text sizing configuration for high-resolution output (figure_size,
    element_text)
  - Professional scientific context (sensor grid temperature readings)
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some unused space on the right side due to colorbar placement
  - Marker size could be slightly larger (size=5-6) for better visibility at this
    data density
  - Temperature range could show more variation to better demonstrate the full colormap
    spectrum
  image_description: 'The plot displays a color-mapped scatter plot with 150 data
    points distributed across a 100m × 100m sensor grid. Points are colored using
    the viridis colormap to represent temperature values ranging from approximately
    20°C to 45°C. A clear spatial temperature gradient is visible: cooler temperatures
    (purple/dark blue, ~20-25°C) appear in the lower-left region while warmer temperatures
    (yellow/green, ~40-45°C) appear in the upper-right region. The title "scatter-color-mapped
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Axis labels show "X Position
    (m)" and "Y Position (m)" with units. A vertical colorbar legend on the right
    side is labeled "Temperature (°C)" with tick marks at 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45.
    The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle gridlines and good use of transparency
    (alpha=0.8) for the markers.'
