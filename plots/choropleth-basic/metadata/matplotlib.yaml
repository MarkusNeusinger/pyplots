review:
  strengths:
  - 'Successfully addressed all previous review feedback: Alaska/Hawaii now included,
    missing data handling demonstrated with DC'
  - Creative tile grid map approach eliminates need for external GIS dependencies
    (geopandas/shapely)
  - Excellent text contrast logic (white on dark tiles, blue on light tiles) ensures
    all labels are readable
  - Professional rounded tile design with white borders creates clean, modern appearance
  - Comprehensive coverage of all 50 US states with realistic population density values
  - Proper colorbar with units and legend for missing data pattern
  weaknesses:
  - State abbreviation font size (13pt) is functional but slightly small for optimal
    4800×2700 display; 14-15pt would improve readability
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with extra whitespace on left side due to Alaska/Hawaii
    placement
