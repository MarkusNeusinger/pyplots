review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature data that clearly demonstrates the time series
    pattern
  - Well-implemented brush selection with linked overview panel (classic focus+context
    technique)
  - Proper tooltip formatting with date and temperature values
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  - Good use of Altair's declarative encoding and selection parameters
  weaknesses:
  - Missing mouse wheel zoom and click-drag pan functionality (spec explicitly requests
    these)
  - No reset zoom button to return to full view
  - Could add .interactive() to main chart for built-in zoom/pan capabilities
  - Overview panel Y-axis label is slightly cramped/overlapping
  image_description: 'The plot displays a dual-panel line chart visualization. The
    main (top) panel shows daily temperature readings throughout 2024 with a blue
    line (#306998) and point markers. The data exhibits a clear seasonal pattern:
    temperatures start cold (around -8°C to 6°C in January), rise through spring,
    peak in summer (reaching ~36°C in July), and decline through autumn/winter. The
    bottom panel serves as a range selector, showing the same data in condensed form
    with the instruction "Drag to select range." Both panels have "Date" on the x-axis
    and "Temperature (°C)" on the y-axis. The title correctly follows the format:
    "Daily Temperature 2024 · line-interactive · altair · pyplots.ai". Grid lines
    are subtle, and all text is clearly readable.'

        comment: Good use of selection_interval for brush selection, vconcat for linked
          charts, tooltip encoding. However, could use .interactive() for additional
          zoom/pan, which is an Altair signature feature
  verdict: APPROVED
