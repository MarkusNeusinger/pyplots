review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of spec for a library without native animation support
    by using small multiples
  - Clear visual progression with color gradient from light to dark blue showing temporal
    direction
  - Prominent yellow highlight marker on the current data point draws attention effectively
  - Realistic temperature data with clear seasonal pattern makes the concept easy
    to understand
  - Clean code following KISS principles with good documentation header
  - Bonus HTML output provides interactive viewing option
  weaknesses:
  - The x-axis range (0-60) is consistent across all panels but causes some visual
    redundancy; showing only the relevant portion per year could enhance the progressive
    reveal effect
  - The yellow current-point marker, while visible, could benefit from being slightly
    larger or having a glow/halo effect as suggested in spec Notes
  image_description: The plot displays a small multiples visualization with 5 faceted
    panels (Year 1 through Year 5 Complete) showing monthly temperature data progressively
    revealed over time. Each panel shows a line chart with temperature (°C) on the
    y-axis ranging from approximately -2 to 34, and "Months Since Jan 2020" on the
    x-axis. The line uses a gradient color scheme transitioning from light blue (#a8c7e6)
    for older data to darker blue (#306998) for newer data, creating a visual representation
    of temporal progression. Each panel features a prominent yellow (#FFD43B) circular
    marker highlighting the current/most recent data point. The data shows a clear
    seasonal sinusoidal pattern with peaks around 30-33°C in summer months and troughs
    near 0-2°C in winter months. The title "line-animated-progressive · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The layout is clean with a minimal theme, subtle
    gray grid lines, and well-sized axis labels.
