review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent beeswarm algorithm implementation that properly spreads points horizontally
    to avoid overlap
  - Good use of pygal XY chart to simulate swarm plot behavior
  - Clear distinction between categories with appropriate colors
  - Mean markers added for each category as suggested in spec
  - Realistic employee performance data scenario with appropriate score ranges
  - 'Title follows correct format: swarm-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows duplicate entries for categories and Mean - could be cleaner
  - Y-axis range extends to 120 but no data points above ~115, slight wasted space
    at top
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm/beeswarm plot showing employee performance
    scores (y-axis, ranging from 30-120) across four departments (x-axis): Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, and Operations. Each department has its data points displayed
    in a distinct color: Engineering in blue (#306998), Marketing in yellow (#FFD43B),
    Sales in green (#4CAF50), and Operations in orange (#FF5722). The points are spread
    horizontally within each category column to avoid overlap, creating the characteristic
    "beeswarm" pattern. Each category also has a subtle horizontal line indicating
    the mean value. The title "swarm-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    A legend at the bottom shows all four department names plus "Mean". The background
    is white with subtle horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: Creative use of XY chart with custom beeswarm algorithm; pygal does
          not have native swarm plot support, so this is a good workaround using stroke=False
          for scatter-like points
  verdict: APPROVED
