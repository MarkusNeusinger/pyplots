review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart concept with proper band folding algorithm
  - Clean separation of positive (blue) and negative (red) deviations with 3 intensity
    levels each
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with distinct patterns per server (daily
    cycles, spikes, periodic flushes)
  - Effective use of seaborn color palettes and styling features
  - Properly formatted title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between for core visualization rather than seaborn plotting
    functions (acceptable limitation for horizon charts)
  - Grid lines are quite subtle and could be slightly more visible for time tracking
  - Legend Deviation from Baseline title could specify units (percentage points)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizon chart showing 5 server metrics (Web
    Server, Database, Cache, API Gateway, Auth Service) over a 24-hour period from
    00:00 to 20:00+. Each row represents one server with color-coded bands: blues
    (light to dark) for positive deviations and reds/oranges (light to dark) for negative
    deviations from baseline. The title "horizon-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold. A legend in the upper right explains the 6 color bands (Low/Medium/High
    for both positive and negative). X-axis shows time in 4-hour intervals. Server
    names are displayed as y-axis labels on the left. The visualization effectively
    demonstrates the horizon chart concept with folded bands showing intensity through
    color depth.'

        comment: Uses seaborn's color palettes (sns.color_palette), styling (sns.set_style,
          sns.set_context), and despine function. However, the core visualization
          uses matplotlib's fill_between rather than seaborn's native plotting functions,
          which is acceptable since seaborn doesn't have a native horizon chart function
  verdict: APPROVED
