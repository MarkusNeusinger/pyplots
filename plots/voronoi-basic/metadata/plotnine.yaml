review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with clear cell differentiation and well-placed seed
    point markers
  - Proper Voronoi computation with mirror points technique to ensure finite bounded
    cells
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics for layered composition (polygons + points)
  - Colorblind-friendly 20-color palette with adequate contrast
  - Proper clipping to bounding box using Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm
  - Square aspect ratio maintained with coord_fixed
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains functions (clip_polygon) violating KISS principle - should be refactored
    to procedural style if possible
  - Axis labels lack units (though coordinates are unitless in this context)
  image_description: The plot displays a Voronoi diagram with 20 seed points distributed
    within a 10×10 bounded region. Each Voronoi cell is filled with a distinct color
    from a 20-color palette including blues, yellows, oranges, greens, purples, pinks,
    and grays. The cells are clearly delineated with dark gray (#333333) edge lines.
    Each seed point is marked with a blue-outlined yellow-filled circular marker positioned
    within its respective cell. The title "voronoi-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. Axes are labeled "X Coordinate" and "Y Coordinate"
    with tick marks from 0 to 10. The background is light gray (#fafafa) and the plot
    has a square 1:1 aspect ratio. All Voronoi cells are properly clipped to the bounding
    box with no infinite regions extending beyond the visible area.
