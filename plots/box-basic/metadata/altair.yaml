review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with proper encoding types (N for nominal,
    Q for quantitative)
  - 'Well-customized box plot with styled median line (white, strokeWidth: 3) and
    outlier sizing'
  - 'Good color palette using Python colors (#306998, #FFD43B) plus colorblind-safe
    additions'
  - Proper currency formatting on y-axis using format specification
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Does not include tooltips which are a key Altair feature for data exploration
  - Legend is explicitly hidden (legend=None) when it could aid readability
  - Grid opacity configured but not showing strongly in the visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box plots comparing salary distributions
    across departments (Engineering, Finance, HR, Marketing, Sales). Each department
    has a distinct color: blue for Engineering, yellow for Finance, light blue for
    HR, gray for Marketing, and green for Sales. The boxes show quartiles with white
    median lines, whiskers extend to show data range, and outliers appear as hollow
    circles. The y-axis displays "Salary ($)" with currency formatting ($0 to $180,000),
    and the x-axis shows "Department" with angled labels. The title "box-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A subtle grid is present in the background.'
