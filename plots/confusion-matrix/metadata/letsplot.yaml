quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast using scale_color_identity() for dynamic white/black text
    based on cell darkness
  - Row-normalized percentages with raw counts provide dual interpretation
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML export showing detailed cell information
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar implementation with proper categorical ordering
  - Square aspect ratio via coord_fixed() ideal for confusion matrices
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar could be positioned closer to the plot for better visual cohesion
  - Grid/Legend score impacted by colorbar distance from main plot area
