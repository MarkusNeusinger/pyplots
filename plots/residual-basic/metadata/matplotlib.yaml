review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including y=0 reference line,
    transparency, and smoothed trend line
  - Symmetric y-axis range around zero provides excellent visual balance for residual
    interpretation
  - Realistic data with heteroscedasticity and outliers demonstrates actual regression
    diagnostic patterns
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper layering via zorder
  - Good use of matplotlib styling with white edge colors on markers for better visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use "Fitted Values (units)" if a specific
    context was established)
  - Legend includes "Zero Reference" which adds visual clutter - the horizontal line
    is self-explanatory
  - Moving average implementation is manual rather than using scipy or statsmodels
    LOWESS for more accurate smoothing
