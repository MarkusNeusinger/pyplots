review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent nested donut chart design showing portfolio hierarchy
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme with coordinated shades per category
  - Well-structured data with realistic portfolio allocation scenario
  - Good use of center text for chart identification
  - Proper white edge separation between segments
  weaknesses:
  - Spec calls for interactive hover tooltips and click-to-drill-down navigation,
    which are not implemented (matplotlib limitation for interactivity)
  - Legend only shows category totals, not individual holdings
  - The inner ring percentage labels overlap slightly with the outer ring wedges in
    the Cash segment area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a nested donut chart showing portfolio allocation
    across asset classes. The inner ring shows 4 asset categories: Equities (48%,
    blue), Fixed Income (30%, green), Alternatives (17%, brown/orange), and Cash (5%,
    gray). The outer ring breaks down each category into individual holdings: US Large
    Cap (25%), International (15%), Emerging Markets (8%) for Equities; Government
    Bonds (18%), Corporate Bonds (12%) for Fixed Income; Real Estate (10%), Commodities
    (7%) for Alternatives; and Money Market (5%) for Cash. The center contains "Portfolio
    Allocation" text. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all four categories
    with their totals. The title "pie-portfolio-interactive · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. Colors are well-coordinated with blue shades for equities,
    greens for fixed income, browns for alternatives, and gray for cash. White edges
    separate the segments clearly.'
