review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with long-format data transformation
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue (#306998)
  - Combines line styles (strokeDash) with colors for additional differentiation
  - Proper font sizing throughout (18pt labels, 22pt titles, 28pt chart title)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic monthly sales data with distinct trends for each product line
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols show filled circles which do not clearly match the line stroke
    colors in the chart
  - Could add tooltips for better interactivity in the HTML version
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace when minimum data is around

  image_description: The plot displays a multi-line comparison chart tracking 4 product
    lines (Electronics, Clothing, Furniture, Books) over 24 months from February 2023
    to December 2024. The title "line-multi · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top. Electronics (coral/red) shows the highest values (~150-195k), followed
    by Clothing (yellow, dotted line pattern, ~110-170k with seasonal variation),
    Furniture (green, steady ~80-95k), and Books (blue, lowest, ~40-65k with gradual
    upward trend). Each line has circular markers at data points. The legend "Product
    Line" is positioned in the top-right. Y-axis shows "Sales (thousands USD)" from
    0-200, X-axis shows "Month" with date labels. Subtle dashed grid lines appear
    in the background.
