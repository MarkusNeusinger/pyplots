review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and markers for the canvas dimensions
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that demonstrates clear line trends
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with good reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Appropriate use of dashed grid lines for subtle visual guidance
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries is imported from area module instead of the dedicated line module
  - Legend could be hidden for single-series plots to reduce visual clutter
  - Data shows smooth seasonal curve but lacks irregular variations that would better
    demonstrate line plot flexibility
