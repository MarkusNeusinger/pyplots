review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of custom subplot grid with colspan specification
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial dashboard scenario with coherent data story
  - Proper title format and good use of Python blue/yellow color scheme
  - All subplots have clear, descriptive titles and axis labels with units
  - Good use of plotly make_subplots with specs parameter for non-uniform grid
  weaknesses:
  - No rowspan demonstration (spec mentions both colspan AND rowspan)
  - Grid lines not visible (could add subtle grid for better readability)
  - Scatter plot markers could be slightly larger for the data density (50 points)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a custom subplot grid with 5 panels arranged
    in a 2×3 grid. The main title "subplot-grid-custom · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top in large font. The top-left panel ("Stock Price (2 Columns)") spans
    2 columns and shows a blue line chart of stock price over time from January to
    April 2024, with price declining from ~108 to ~78. The top-right panel ("Category
    Performance") shows a yellow bar chart with 4 categories (Product A-D) with scores
    ranging from ~68 to ~91. The bottom row has three equal-width panels: "Trading
    Volume" (blue bar chart showing volume over time), "Revenue vs Expenses" (blue
    scatter plot showing positive correlation), and "Daily Returns Distribution" (yellow
    histogram of returns centered around 0%). All panels use the Python blue (#306998)
    and yellow (#FFD43B) color scheme. Axis labels include units where appropriate.'

        comment: uses make_subplots with specs for custom grid, graph_objects for
          fine control, but doesn't leverage interactivity features like hover customization
  verdict: APPROVED
