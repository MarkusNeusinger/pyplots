review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform and colorblind-accessible
    visualization
  - Clean implementation with proper dB scale conversion for power spectral density
  - Clear chirp signal demonstrates time-frequency analysis effectively
  - Proper scipy.signal integration for spectrogram computation
  - Well-sized text for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines (dashed) are somewhat distracting over the heatmap image; consider
    disabling or reducing opacity
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive hover tools to show frequency/time/power values
