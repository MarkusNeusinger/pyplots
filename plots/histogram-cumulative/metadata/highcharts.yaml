review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step-area visualization that clearly shows cumulative distribution behavior
  - Proper use of gradient fill creates visually appealing depth effect
  - Clear title format following pyplots.ai convention with informative subtitle
  - Well-chosen realistic educational context with appropriate sample size
  - Good colorblind-safe color choice (#306998)
  - Proper use of Selenium for PNG export with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned more optimally (e.g., inside the plot area in lower-right
    corner)
  - Output image height slightly differs from specified 2700px
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram showing student test
    score distribution. The chart uses a step-area visualization with a blue color
    (#306998) and gradient fill transitioning from semi-transparent blue at the top
    to nearly transparent at the bottom. The title "histogram-cumulative · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Student Test Score
    Distribution (n=280)" below it. The x-axis shows "Test Score" ranging from 0 to
    100, and the y-axis shows "Cumulative Percentage (%)" from 0% to 100%. Blue circular
    markers appear at each data point along the step function. The curve is monotonically
    increasing as expected for a cumulative distribution, with steeper slopes in the
    40-80 range indicating where most scores fall. Grid lines are subtle light gray.

        comment: Markers are well-sized (radius 10), line width is good (4px). The

        comment: Shows cumulative distribution with interesting shape (multimodal
          underlying data creates visible inflection points). The S-curve shape demonstrates
          percentile concepts well.

          The n=280 sample size is reasonable.

        comment: Scores clipped to 0-100 are realistic. The tri-modal distribution
          (struggling/average/high performers) is plausible but somewhat stylized.
