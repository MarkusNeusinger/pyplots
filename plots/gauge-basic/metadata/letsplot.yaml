review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a gauge chart using lets-plot polygon and segment
    geoms
  - Clean, well-structured code with clear comments explaining each section
  - Proper use of grammar of graphics approach to build the gauge from primitives
  - White borders between zones provide good visual separation
  - Value display is prominent and well-positioned
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme uses red/yellow/green which may not be fully accessible to colorblind
    users
  - Could add intermediate tick marks or labels for better readability of values between
    0-100
