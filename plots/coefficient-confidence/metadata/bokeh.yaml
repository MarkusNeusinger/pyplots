review:
  strengths:
  - Correct horizontal layout with variables on Y-axis for readability
  - Clean data generation with realistic housing price regression context
  - Proper zero reference line implementation
  - Variables sorted by coefficient magnitude as spec recommends
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Significant vs non-significant coefficients are NOT visually distinguished in
    the rendered output (all appear as same blue color) - this is a key spec requirement
  - Legend is not visible in the PNG output (appears cut off on the right side)
  - Text sizes could be larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - HoverTool feature is not useful in static PNG export
  image_description: The plot displays a coefficient plot with confidence intervals
    for 10 housing price predictor variables. Variables are arranged vertically on
    the y-axis (sorted by coefficient magnitude from Property Tax Rate at bottom to
    Square Footage at top). Each coefficient is shown as a blue point with horizontal
    lines extending to show 95% confidence intervals. A vertical dashed reference
    line at zero clearly indicates the null hypothesis threshold. The x-axis shows
    "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)" ranging from approximately -0.4 to 0.6.
    All coefficients and their error bars are rendered in the same blue color (#1f77b4)
    - there is NO visual distinction between significant and non-significant coefficients
    despite the code creating separate renderers for this purpose. The title "coefficient-confidence
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at top left. The plot has a light gray background
    (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines. The legend is NOT visible in the rendered
    PNG image - it appears to be cut off or not rendering properly.
