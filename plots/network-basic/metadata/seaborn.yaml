review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed layout algorithm from scratch
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot with hue for community coloring and size for degree
    encoding
  - Clean legend showing only the group categories (filtered out size legend entries)
  - Appropriate color palette that is colorblind-friendly
  - Node labels are centered and readable with bold font
  - Network structure clearly shows the four communities with bridge connections
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels in dense areas (Leo/Jack/Mia region) have minor crowding
  - The force-directed algorithm implementation is quite verbose for a KISS-style
    script
  image_description: 'The plot displays a social network graph with 20 nodes representing
    people, connected by gray edges. Nodes are colored by team membership: Team A
    (blue), Team B (yellow/gold), Team C (green), and Team D (coral/orange). Each
    node displays the person''s name as a label centered on the node. Node sizes vary
    based on degree (number of connections). The network shows clear community clustering
    with the four teams grouped together, connected by bridge edges. The title "Social
    Network · network-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in
    the upper left shows the four team colors. The background is white with no axis
    elements visible (axes are turned off appropriately for a network graph).'
