review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style visual design with recognizable green color scheme
  - Dynamic legend with actual value ranges calculated from data
  - Proper calendar layout with correct weekday/month positioning
  - Realistic contribution pattern data showing weekday activity bias
  - Advanced use of pygal extensibility by creating custom Graph subclass
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical space utilization could be improved; calendar grid appears compact relative
    to canvas height
  - Code uses class-based structure instead of KISS flat script style (though justified
    for custom chart type)
