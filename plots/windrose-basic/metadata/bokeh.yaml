review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate handling by manually constructing wedge polygons with
    proper angular math
  - Clean stacking of speed bins from center outward with cumulative radius calculation
  - Good use of Bokeh's ColumnDataSource and patches for complex polygon rendering
  - Realistic coastal wind data with Weibull distribution for wind speeds
  - Color palette progresses logically from cool to warm representing increasing wind
    intensity
  - Proper meteorological convention with North at top and clockwise direction progression
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small relative to the plot size (18pt vs 22pt direction labels)
  - The percentage labels on the concentric circles could be larger for better readability
  - Missing explicit Frequency (%) label for the radial axis
  image_description: The wind rose chart displays a polar histogram with 8 directional
    spokes (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). North is correctly positioned at the top.
    The visualization shows stacked wedge segments colored from cool blue (#306998,
    0-3 m/s) through teal, yellow, orange, to red/coral (>12 m/s) representing increasing
    wind speeds. The dominant wind directions are clearly W, NW, and SW, matching
    the coastal weather station scenario. Five concentric reference circles are visible
    (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%) with percentage labels. The legend on the right shows
    all 5 speed categories. The title "windrose-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is at
    the top, and "Wind Speed (m/s)" appears at the bottom. The plot uses a square
    1:1 aspect ratio appropriate for polar visualizations.

        comment: Title at 32pt, direction labels at 22pt, and reference labels at
          16pt are all clearly readable. Slightly better would be larger percentage
          labels.

        comment: Wedge segments are clearly visible with good separation. The innermost
          blue segments are a bit small for the smallest frequencies.

        comment: Color progression from blue→teal→yellow→orange→red is colorblind-friendly
          (not relying on red-green distinction alone).

        comment: The subtitle says "Wind Speed (m/s)" but there's no explicit axis
          label for direction or frequency.

        comment: Concentric circles are subtle (alpha 0.5), legend is well-placed.
          Grid lines could be slightly more subtle.

        comment: Shows varied wind patterns across directions with clear dominant
          directions (W, NW, SW). Could show slightly more variation in speed distribution
          across directions.

        comment: Wind speeds 0-12+ m/s are realistic. The Weibull distribution is
          the standard for wind speed modeling. Percentages reaching ~25% are reasonable.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, patches with nested arrays, custom Legend
          with LegendItem. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool
          for interactivity, but this is a static PNG output.
  verdict: APPROVED
