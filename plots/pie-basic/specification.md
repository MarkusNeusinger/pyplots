# pie-basic: Basic Pie Chart

## Description

A pie chart showing proportions of categorical data as slices of a circle. Each slice represents a category's contribution to the whole, with the angle proportional to its value. Essential for visualizing parts-to-whole relationships in a simple, intuitive format.

## Applications

- Market share distribution across competitors
- Budget allocation by department
- Survey response breakdown
- Resource utilization by category

## Data

- `category` (string) - category labels
- `value` (numeric) - values for each category
- Size: 3-8 categories (too many becomes unreadable)

## Notes

- Include percentage labels on slices
- Use distinct colors for each category
- Add a legend for category identification
- Consider slight explosion for emphasis on key slice
