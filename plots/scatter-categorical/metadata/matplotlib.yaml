review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of different marker shapes (circle, square, triangle) for additional
    category distinction beyond color
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Realistic Iris-like data scenario that is scientifically relevant and neutral
  - White edge colors on markers improve visibility and separation
  - Proper font sizing throughout for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Library features could be more distinctive - matplotlib offers patheffects, custom
    marker paths, or gradient fills that are not utilized
  - Yellow markers with white background could have slightly better contrast
  image_description: The plot shows a categorical scatter plot with three distinct
    species groups displayed using different colors and marker shapes. Species A (blue
    circles) appears in the lower-left cluster with petal lengths ~1-2 cm and widths
    ~0.1-0.5 cm. Species B (yellow/gold squares) occupies the middle region with petal
    lengths ~3-5 cm and widths ~1-1.8 cm. Species C (teal triangles) forms the upper-right
    cluster with petal lengths ~4.5-7 cm and widths ~1.4-3.1 cm. The title reads "scatter-categorical
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axis labels show "Petal Length (cm)" and
    "Petal Width (cm)" with units. A legend in the upper-left clearly identifies the
    three species. Grid lines are subtle with dashed style. The overall layout is
    well-balanced with good use of the canvas space.

        comment: Blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), and teal (#2AA198) are distinguishable
          and avoid red-green confusion. Different marker shapes (circle, square,
          triangle) provide additional distinction. Minor deduction as yellow could
          be slightly challenging against white background for some viewers

        comment: Uses standard scatter() with colors and markers. Could leverage matplotlib-specific
          features like patheffects, custom markers, or colormaps more distinctively
