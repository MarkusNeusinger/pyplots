review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent elbow point annotation with arrow, bordered text box, and contrasting
    yellow marker that draws attention
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper use of hovertemplate for interactive exploration with formatted values
  - Good color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and complementary yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Appropriate font sizes throughout ensuring readability at full resolution
  - Correct implementation of monotonically decreasing inertia values
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility is too subtle (alpha 0.1) making it hard to trace values
  - Interactive HTML is generated but not being evaluated; could leverage more Plotly-specific
    interactive features
