review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic software dependency scenario that perfectly fits the hive
    plot use case
  - KISS principle now followed with inline polar-to-cartesian calculations
  - Clean color scheme with Python-inspired blue and yellow plus complementary teal
  - Good edge transparency (0.35) prevents hairball effect while showing connection
    structure
  - Proper 3-axis hive plot structure with meaningful axis assignment by module type
  - Includes tooltips for interactive exploration in HTML version
  - Square canvas format appropriate for radial plot
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization still suboptimal - plot occupies mainly upper portion with
    ~40% empty space at bottom
  - Legend appears despite legend=None in code - may need global configure to fully
    disable
  - Some label crowding on Interface axis where lower-importance nodes cluster
  - np.random.seed(42) set but no random generation actually used - unnecessary import
  - Does not leverage Altair data transformation capabilities for position calculation
