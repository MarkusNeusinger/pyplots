review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range interval concept using bar() with bottom parameter
  - Clear seasonal temperature pattern demonstrates realistic data
  - Annotations add value by showing exact min/max temperatures
  - Midpoint markers provide additional context as suggested in spec
  - Good use of alpha blending and edge colors for visual appeal
  - Correct title format and professional styling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows identical symbols for Min and Max Temperature (both underscore markers),
    making them visually indistinguishable
  image_description: The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges for a coastal city. Each month (Jan-Dec) is represented by a vertical blue
    bar indicating the temperature range from minimum to maximum. The bars use a semi-transparent
    blue fill (#306998) with darker blue edges (#1f4d6b). Yellow circular markers
    indicate the midpoint temperature for each month. Min/max temperature annotations
    are placed above and below each bar (e.g., "4°" at bottom, "11°" at top for January).
    The chart shows a clear seasonal pattern with warmer temperatures in summer months
    (July peaks at 24-31°C) and cooler temperatures in winter (February at 2-15°C).
    A legend in the upper right identifies Min Temperature, Max Temperature, and Midpoint
    markers. The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" and x-axis shows "Month". Grid lines
    are subtle with alpha=0.3.
