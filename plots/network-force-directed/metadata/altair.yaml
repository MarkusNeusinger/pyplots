review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    with proper attractive/repulsive forces and cooling
  - Clear community structure visualization with three well-separated clusters
  - Good use of node size encoding to show degree (connection count)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with strong differentiation between Engineering (blue),
    Marketing (yellow), and Sales (coral)
  - Proper use of Altair layered composition to combine edges, nodes, and labels
  - Tooltips provide useful community and degree information on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Some Hub labels overlap in dense areas (particularly in the Engineering cluster)
  - Edge opacity is quite low (0.4) making some connections difficult to trace visually
  - Generates unnecessary plot.html file in addition to plot.png
  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph with 50 nodes
    arranged in three distinct community clusters. The nodes are colored by team membership:
    blue (Engineering) on the right side, yellow (Marketing) in the lower-left area,
    and coral/salmon red (Sales) in the upper-left area. Gray edges connect nodes
    within and between communities. Node sizes vary based on degree (number of connections),
    with larger nodes having more connections. High-degree nodes are labeled "Hub"
    in dark text above them. The title "network-force-directed · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend labeled "Teams" appears in the upper-right corner
    with color-coded entries for each community. The layout clearly reveals the three-community
    structure with visible bridge connections between clusters.'

        comment: 'Legend placed well in upper-right, but no grid needed for network
          graphs. However, the edge color is very light (gray #AAAAAA with 0.4 opacity)
          making some edges hard to trace.'

        comment: 50 nodes is appropriate. Intra-community edge probability of 0.3
          is reasonable. Bridge edges are manually defined but sparse, which is realistic.

        comment: Uses Altair's layered composition (edges + nodes + labels), mark_circle
          with encoding, Color scale with domain/range, tooltips. However, doesn't
          use Altair's more distinctive features like selections for interactivity
          or compound marks.
