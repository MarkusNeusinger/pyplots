review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn colorblind palette for accessibility
  - Smart depth shading using sns.light_palette to show hierarchy within categories
  - Clean white borders clearly separate all rectangles
  - Dynamic text color selection based on background luminance ensures readability
  - Adaptive font sizing based on rectangle area
  - Well-designed legend with horizontal layout below the plot
  weaknesses:
  - Uses strict=True in zip() which is Python 3.10+ specific and unnecessary for this
    use case
