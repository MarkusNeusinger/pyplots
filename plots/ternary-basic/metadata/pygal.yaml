review:
  strengths:
  - Correct ternary coordinate transformation using mathematical formula
  - Good use of realistic soil composition data spanning the entire triangle
  - Clean grid lines at 20% intervals using dashed style
  - Proper square canvas format (3600x3600) for ternary symmetry
  - Custom Style configuration with appropriate font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing vertex labels (Sand, Silt, Clay) - essential for ternary plot interpretation
  - No tick marks along triangle edges to help read proportions
  - No legend or annotation explaining what data points represent
  - Title font could be larger for better readability
