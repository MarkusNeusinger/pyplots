review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal custom Style class for consistent typography at high resolution
  - Clean filled area visualization that clearly shows drawdown depth and duration
  - Smart legend that includes maximum drawdown value and date
  - Proper drawdown calculation using running maximum formula
  - Good x-axis label handling with rotation and sparse labeling for readability
  - Correct title format following specification
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (nearly invisible on y-axis guides)
  - Missing explicit visual annotation/marker highlighting the maximum drawdown point
    on the chart
  - Recovery points (where drawdown returns to zero) could be marked for better clarity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart visualizing portfolio drawdown
    percentages over time from January 2022 to April 2023. The chart uses a red (#cc3333)
    filled area extending from the zero baseline down to negative drawdown values.
    The y-axis shows "Drawdown (%)" ranging from approximately +4% to -28%, with the
    x-axis showing dates in YYYY-MM format at 45-degree rotation. The title reads
    "drawdown-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top center. A legend at the bottom
    left displays "Drawdown (Max: -26.5% on 2022-04-15)" indicating the maximum drawdown
    event. The filled area clearly shows multiple drawdown periods with varying depths,
    including a significant ~26% drawdown in early 2022, recovery points where the
    line returns to zero, and subsequent smaller drawdowns throughout the period.'
