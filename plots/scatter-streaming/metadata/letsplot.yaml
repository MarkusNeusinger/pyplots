review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the streaming concept using dual opacity/color encoding
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with temperature-humidity correlation and temporal
    drift
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with scale_color_gradient and scale_alpha
  - Correct title format and well-labeled axes with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned far from plot creates slight visual imbalance
  - Oldest data points (age=0) may be too faint with alpha starting at 0.15
  - HTML version could leverage interactive tooltips to show timestamp on hover
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot of 200 simulated sensor readings
    showing Temperature (°C) on the x-axis (range ~21-26.5) and Humidity (%) on the
    y-axis (range ~44-68). Points are colored using a blue gradient from dark navy
    (#1a365d) for older points to medium blue (#306998) for newer points, with a "Recency"
    legend on the right showing values from 0 to 1. Older points appear more transparent
    (faded) while newer points are more opaque, creating a visual effect of streaming
    data where recent arrivals stand out. The plot uses a minimal white background
    with subtle gridlines. The title correctly shows "scatter-streaming · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The data shows a positive correlation between temperature
    and humidity with some drift over time, representing simulated IoT sensor readings.
