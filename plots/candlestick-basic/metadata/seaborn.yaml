review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing throughout
  - Clean candlestick visualization with properly proportioned bodies and wicks
  - Good date formatting showing every 5th day to avoid crowding
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with proper price walk simulation
  - Subtle grid helps read price levels without being distracting
  weaknesses:
  - Uses green/red color scheme which is not colorblind-safe (code defines blue/orange
    in color_map but rendered output shows green/red - custom colors not being applied
    to bars)
  - Seaborn lacks native candlestick support so implementation is essentially matplotlib
    with seaborn styling rather than using seaborn distinctive features
