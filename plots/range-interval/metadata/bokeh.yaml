review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the range interval concept using segment glyphs with
    rounded caps
  - Perfect data scenario with realistic seasonal temperature variations
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data organization
  - Comprehensive styling with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - All spec requirements met including endpoint markers and midpoints
  weaknesses:
  - Legend markers appear as tiny colored dots rather than showing the actual marker
    shapes (circle, diamond)
  - Missing Bokeh distinctive interactive features like HoverTool that could show
    exact temperatures on hover
  image_description: The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges for a city across all 12 months (Jan-Dec). Each month is represented by
    a vertical blue bar (#306998) with rounded caps extending from the minimum to
    maximum temperature. The bars have semi-transparency (alpha 0.7). At the bottom
    of each bar is a dark blue circle marker indicating the minimum temperature, at
    the top is a yellow circle with blue border indicating the maximum temperature,
    and a white diamond with blue outline marks the midpoint. The title "range-interval
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The y-axis is labeled "Temperature
    (°C)" and the x-axis is labeled "Month". A legend in the top-left corner identifies
    the three marker types. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed
    horizontal grid lines. The plot shows a realistic seasonal temperature pattern
    with coldest months (Jan, Feb, Dec) having ranges around -2°C to 11°C and warmest
    months (Jul, Aug) reaching up to 30°C.

        comment: Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive features (HoverTool, tooltips)
          which are its main strength; the static PNG export doesn't showcase what
          makes Bokeh special
