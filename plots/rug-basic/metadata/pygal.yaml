review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to implement rug plot (not a native chart type)
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with response times showing natural clustering
  - Proper use of alpha/opacity for overlapping tick marks
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - 'Poor canvas utilization: rug ticks occupy only ~15% of vertical space, leaving
    massive whitespace above'
  - Y-axis line visible on left edge is distracting and unnecessary for rug plots
  - Tick marks could be more prominent (thicker stroke width) for better visibility
    at the target resolution
