review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highstock for synchronized dual-pane layout
  - Proper 70%/25% vertical split between price and volume panes as specified
  - Volume bars correctly color-matched to candlestick direction
  - Crosshair configured for precise price/volume reading across both panes
  - Realistic stock data generation with proper gap handling and volatility modeling
  - Clean title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-configured axis formatting ($ prefix for prices, M suffix for volumes)
  weaknesses:
  - Blue/red color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue/orange instead)
  - X-axis date labels appear clipped/truncated at bottom of image
