review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative workaround for Altair's lack of native polar coordinates by
    converting to Cartesian space
  - Beautiful visual design with well-constructed grid circles and radial lines
  - Compelling data story comparing Northern vs Southern hemisphere temperature patterns
  - Clean, readable code structure with good inline comments
  - Proper use of Altair's layering system to combine grid, labels, and data
  - Color choices provide excellent accessibility and visual contrast
  weaknesses:
  - No radius scale labels showing what the concentric circles represent (temperature
    values)
