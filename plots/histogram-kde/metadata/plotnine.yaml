review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of after_stat("density") for proper histogram-KDE scaling
  - Realistic financial data simulation with multiple market regimes (normal, volatile,
    low-volatility periods)
  - Perfect color contrast between blue histogram and yellow KDE curve
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper layering
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are nearly invisible (panel_grid_major alpha=0.3 combined with light
    color makes them hard to see)
