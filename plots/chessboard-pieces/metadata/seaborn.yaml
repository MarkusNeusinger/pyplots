review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn heatmap for the checkerboard pattern with custom colormap
  - Path effects (stroke) on pieces ensures visibility on both light and dark squares
  - Perfect board orientation following chess standards (h1 is light)
  - Scholars Mate is an excellent educational example that demonstrates the full capability
  - Clean, readable code structure with well-documented piece positions
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features (primarily using matplotlib text
    for pieces)
  - The code quality score takes a minor hit because while the data is deterministic
    (which is fine), there is no explicit seed or comment noting the intentional determinism
  image_description: 'The plot displays a chess board showing the Scholar''s Mate
    position (a famous 4-move checkmate). The board uses classic chess colors: light
    tan/cream squares (#F0D9B5) and darker brown squares (#B58863). All 8 files (a-h)
    are labeled along the bottom and all 8 ranks (1-8) along the left side in bold
    text. Unicode chess symbols are used for pieces - white pieces appear in white
    with a subtle gray outline, black pieces in dark gray/black. The white queen on
    f7 delivers checkmate to the black king on e8. White has standard development
    with pieces on their starting squares except for the pawn on e4, white queen on
    f7, and both bishops still on c1 and f1. Black has pawns on ranks 7, a knight
    on c6 and f6, and back rank pieces. The board is properly oriented with white
    at bottom (h1 is light as per chess standards). Title at top reads "Scholar''s
    Mate · chessboard-pieces · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
