review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Well-implemented contour labels with proper font size and white color for visibility
  - Mathematical peaks function creates visually interesting surface with multiple
    local minima/maxima
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack domain-specific context or units (e.g., could be "X Position
    (units)" for a realistic scenario)
  - Data context is purely mathematical rather than tied to a real-world application
    from the spec examples
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization of a mathematical
    surface (peaks-like function) using the Viridis colormap. The plot shows multiple
    regions: a prominent yellow peak (maximum ~8) in the upper-center region around
    coordinates (0, 1.5), several teal/cyan mid-value regions, a dark blue minor depression
    around (-2, 0.5), and a deep purple/magenta minimum (~-6) in the lower-center
    area around (0, -2). The colorbar on the right shows the Z Value scale ranging
    from approximately -6 to 8. Contour lines are clearly drawn with white labels
    showing the numeric values at each level. The title "contour-basic · plotly ·
    pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. Axis labels show "X Coordinate" and "Y
    Coordinate" with tick marks from -3 to 3 on both axes.'
