review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clean network layout with well-positioned stations
  - Good use of Highcharts annotations for route labels with styled badges
  - Offset mechanism for parallel routes prevents overlap
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle with embedded legend
  weaknesses:
  - Route labels only show route ID, missing departure/arrival times as specified
    (should be "RE 1 | 06:00 → 06:25")
  - Direction arrows not rendering correctly - appear as dashes instead of arrow characters
  - Helper function violates KISS principle - should inline the color lookup
  - Some route label badges overlap near Central Station hub
  image_description: 'The plot displays a regional rail network diagram with 12 stations
    represented as white circular nodes with blue outlines. Station names are displayed
    above each node in bold black text. The network is centered around "Central Station"
    with connections radiating outward to North Terminal, South Harbor, East Junction,
    and West Plaza, plus peripheral stations like Airport, University, Industrial
    Zone, Northeast Park, Northwest Mall, Southeast Tech, and Southwest Arena. Routes
    are shown as colored lines: blue for Express (EX), yellow for Regional (RE), and
    purple for Local (LC). Each route segment has a colored label badge showing the
    route identifier (e.g., "RE 1", "EX 10", "LC 4"). Direction arrows are shown along
    routes but render as dashes rather than proper arrow characters. The title follows
    the required format with a subtitle showing "Regional Rail Network - 12 Stations,
    19 Routes" and a color-coded legend for route types. The layout is clean with
    good spacing between elements.'
