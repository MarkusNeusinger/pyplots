review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent radar chart construction using polar-to-cartesian coordinate transformation
  - 'Proper layering of geoms: gridlines → spokes → polygons → lines → points → labels'
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.2) for overlapping polygon fills with thicker
    outlines
  - Clean data organization with pandas DataFrames for each visual component
  - Appropriate 1:1 square aspect ratio for symmetric radar chart
  - Realistic smartphone comparison scenario with meaningful attributes
  weaknesses:
  - Grid value labels could be larger for better readability at scale
  - Category axis labels could include units (e.g., Score 0-100) for clarity
  - Color palette includes red-green which may not be ideal for all colorblind users
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart comparing 4 smartphones
    (Galaxy S24, iPhone 15, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12) across 6 attributes: Performance,
    Display, Camera, Battery, Price Value, and Storage. The chart features a hexagonal
    structure with concentric gridlines at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 intervals (dashed
    gray). Four distinctly colored polygons overlay each other with transparency (~0.2
    alpha): blue (Galaxy S24), yellow (iPhone 15), red (Pixel 8), and green (OnePlus
    12). Each polygon has thick colored outlines and circular markers at vertices.
    Category labels are positioned at the outer edge of each axis. A legend on the
    right identifies each product by color. The title follows the correct format:
    "Smartphone Comparison · radar-multi · letsplot · pyplots.ai".'
