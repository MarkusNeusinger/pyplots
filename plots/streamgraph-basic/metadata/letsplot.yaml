review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of centered baseline algorithm for authentic streamgraph
    appearance
  - Clean, readable code with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Well-chosen color palette with good visual contrast between adjacent areas
  - Appropriate removal of y-axis ticks/grid since streamgraphs emphasize relative
    proportions
  - Correct title format and professional layout with good canvas utilization
  - Realistic music streaming scenario matching the specification exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Curves are linear/segmented rather than smooth spline interpolation as specified
  - X-axis grid lines could be more subtle (currently dashed at 0.5 alpha)
  - Y-axis label shows Streaming Hours without units like hrs/month
