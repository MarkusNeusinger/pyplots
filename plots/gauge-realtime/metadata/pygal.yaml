review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to showing real-time nature by displaying temporal progression
    with multiple gauges
  - Good use of pygal SolidGauge with half_pie mode
  - Clean simple code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate CPU monitoring context that matches spec applications
  - Color differentiation between current (yellow) and historical (gray) values
  - Well-formatted value labels with percentage formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Missing color zones (green/yellow/red) visible within individual gauges - only
    the current gauge shows zone color
  - Missing min (0) and max (100) labels at gauge boundaries as spec requires
  - Title format includes extra CPU Usage Monitor prefix instead of clean spec-id
    format
  - Gauges are relatively small for the 4800x2700 canvas - could utilize space better
  - No visual indication of thresholds within the gauge arcs themselves
  image_description: 'The plot displays four half-pie solid gauges arranged in a 2x2
    grid on a white background. The title "CPU Usage Monitor · gauge-realtime · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The top-left gauge shows 78% in yellow/gold
    color (indicating "Warning" zone), representing the current value. The top-right
    shows 75% in gray (t-1), bottom-left shows 72% in gray (t-2), and bottom-right
    shows 68% in gray (t-3). Each gauge displays its percentage value both inside
    the arc and below. A legend at the bottom identifies each gauge: "Current: 78%
    (Warning)", "t-1: 75%", "t-2: 72%", "t-3: 68%". The gauges use a half-pie style
    with inner radius creating donut-like arcs. The current gauge is distinctively
    yellow while historical values are muted gray.'
