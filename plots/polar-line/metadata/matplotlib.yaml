review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of wind speed data for demonstrating cyclical patterns - a textbook
    application of polar plots
  - Clean code structure with good use of matplotlib polar projection API
  - Proper closing of the loop by appending first point ensures visual continuity
  - Good use of set_theta_zero_location and set_theta_direction for intuitive clockwise
    hour progression
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with distinct marker shapes
  - Radial labels include units (m/s) for clear interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned outside plot area creates slight visual disconnect
  - The two series have very similar patterns making comparison less visually interesting
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib polar features like filled areas
