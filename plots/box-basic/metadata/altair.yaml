  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (median, outliers, whiskers,
    distinct colors)
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with meaningful variation across departments
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code with well-structured data generation
  - Strong text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured
  - Good use of Altair-specific features (aggregate tooltips, interactive zoom/pan,
    HTML export)
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations highlighting key insights (e.g., annotate
    the highest-paid department or the largest salary spread)'
  - 'Visual refinement could be improved: consider adding a subtle background color
    or further customizing tick marks'
  - 'Minor layout issue: some unused vertical space above the data range'
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 vertical box-and-whisker plots comparing
    salary distributions across departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance).
    Each department has a distinct color: Engineering in dark blue (#306998), Marketing
    in golden/amber, Sales in lighter blue, HR in muted purple, and Finance in teal.
    White median lines are visible within each box. Outliers appear as individual
    colored dots — Engineering has one low outlier (~$55k), Marketing has 3 high outliers
    (~$95-101k), Sales has one very high outlier (~$137k), and HR has one low outlier
    (~$33k). The y-axis is labeled "Salary ($)" with dollar-formatted tick labels
    ranging from $30,000 to $140,000. The x-axis is labeled "Department". The title
    reads "box-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top. A subtle light gray grid is
    present. The distributions vary meaningfully: Engineering is high and moderately
    spread, Sales is wide, HR is compact and low, Marketing is mid-range and tight,
    Finance is high with moderate spread.'
