review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good visual differentiation between selected (blue) and unselected (gray) points
  - Appropriate use of pygal custom Style for sizing and colors
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Clear legend explaining selection state with point counts
  weaknesses:
  - Only implements ONE view instead of the required 2-3 coordinated views (scatter
    + histogram + bar chart)
  - No actual linked selection mechanism - just a static representation of pre-selected
    data
  - Missing interactive selection features (brush, click, lasso) and reset button
  - Does not demonstrate the core linked views concept where selecting in one view
    highlights in others
  - Pygal has limited native support for linked views but could show multiple charts
    side-by-side with consistent selection highlighting
  image_description: 'The plot displays a single XY scatter chart on a white background
    with 150 data points total. The title reads "linked-views-selection · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" followed by "Scatter Plot with Selection: 50 of 150 points (Cluster
    B highlighted)". The X-axis is labeled "X Coordinate" (range ~0.5-7.5) and Y-axis
    is labeled "Y Coordinate" (range ~0.5-8.5). There are 50 blue (#306998) points
    clustered in the upper-right area (Cluster B - selected), and 100 gray (#CCCCCC)
    points distributed across two other clusters in the lower-left and middle areas
    (unselected). A legend at the bottom shows "Unselected (100 pts)" in gray and
    "Selected: Cluster B (50 pts)" in blue. Subtle gray grid lines are visible. The
    plot uses good contrast between selected and unselected states but only shows
    a single view instead of the required multiple coordinated views.'
