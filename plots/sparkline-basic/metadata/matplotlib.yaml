review:
  strengths:
  - 'Perfect sparkline aesthetic: no axes, gridlines, or chart chrome - exactly as
    spec requires'
  - Excellent aspect ratio (6:1) matches spec recommendation for sparklines
  - Thoughtful data generation with realistic weekly seasonality pattern
  - Min/max/first/last point highlighting with distinct colors and white edge borders
  - Clean KISS code structure with good comments explaining the data scenario
  - Proper y-margin padding prevents line from touching edges
  weaknesses:
  - Could use fill_between for subtle area fill effect (mentioned as optional in spec)
  - Line could be slightly thinner for more authentic sparkline appearance at small
    sizes
  - Library features score is modest - no advanced matplotlib techniques used
  image_description: 'The plot shows a minimalist sparkline with a blue line (#306998)
    displaying a time series trend over 50 data points. The line shows an overall
    upward trend with periodic oscillations (weekly pattern). Four highlighted points
    are visible: a blue dot at the start (first value), a red dot marking the minimum
    value (around the middle-left), a green dot marking the maximum value (upper portion,
    right of center), and a yellow dot at the end (last value). All dots have white
    edge borders for visibility. The chart has no axes, gridlines, or labels - true
    to sparkline aesthetics. The title "sparkline-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears in gray at the bottom right corner. The aspect ratio is wide and short
    (~6:1), appropriate for sparkline design. White background with clean, professional
    appearance.'
