review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and clear color differentiation
  - Effective use of custom coastline polygons to provide geographic context
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for controlling fonts and colors at high resolution
  - Interactive HTML output with hover tooltips showing city names and populations
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Bubble sizes are categorical (4 fixed sizes) rather than continuously scaled proportional
    to population values as the spec requires
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent compared to ideal subtle alpha 0.2-0.4
  - Does not use pygal World map capability which could provide better geographic
    basemap
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic bubble map with 20 world cities
    plotted on an XY coordinate system where X represents Longitude (-180 to 160°)
    and Y represents Latitude (-60 to 80°). The background is a light blue (#C8DDF0)
    representing oceans, with simplified gray coastline outlines for continents (North
    America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia). City bubbles are color-coded
    by population category: small dark blue (Pop < 12M), medium blue (Pop 12-20M),
    yellow (Pop 20-30M), and red-orange (Pop > 30M). Bubble sizes increase proportionally
    with population category. The two largest red-orange bubbles represent Tokyo and
    Delhi (>30M). The title "bubble-map-geographic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. A legend at the bottom shows the four population categories. Grid lines
    are subtle dashed gray lines.'
