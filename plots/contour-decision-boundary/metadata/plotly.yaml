review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of probability-based contour coloring rather than just discrete
    class regions
  - Clear decision boundary line at probability=0.5 with dashed styling
  - Good marker differentiation using both shape (circle vs diamond) and color
  - Professional colorbar showing class probability scale
  - Responsive layout with proper sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper-left overlaps slightly with some Class 0 data points
  - Could enhance interactivity by adding hover info to the contour regions showing
    probability values
  image_description: The plot displays a decision boundary visualization for a KNN
    classifier trained on moon-shaped data. The background shows a continuous gradient
    from blue (Class 0 probability) to yellow (Class 1 probability), with a dashed
    yellow/orange decision boundary line at the 0.5 probability threshold. Blue circular
    markers represent Class 0 data points (clustered in upper-left region), while
    yellow diamond markers represent Class 1 data points (clustered in lower-right
    region). The title reads "contour-decision-boundary · plotly · pyplots.ai" at
    the top. Axis labels show "Feature 1 (Standardized)" and "Feature 2 (Standardized)".
    A colorbar on the right indicates "Class Probability" from 0 to 1. The legend
    in the upper-left shows Class 0 (circle) and Class 1 (diamond).
