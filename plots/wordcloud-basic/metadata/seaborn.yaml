review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic tech industry survey data with believable frequency values
  - Creative approach to implementing word cloud using spiral placement algorithm
  - Good color variety with HUSL palette providing visual interest
  - Appropriate canvas utilization and overall layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: includes Tech Skills Survey prefix instead of just wordcloud-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai'
  - Significant word overlap in center area (Python/Data/Machine/Agile)
  - Code violates KISS principle with three helper functions instead of flat script
    structure
  - Seaborn barely used - only for subtle background scatter that adds little value
