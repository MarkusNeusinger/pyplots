review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the navigator concept using gggrid to combine main
    chart and mini overview
  - Clear visual connection between selection rectangle in navigator and the detailed
    view
  - Good use of area fill with transparency for visual depth
  - Date range annotation effectively communicates the selected period
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label "Value" is generic without units (could be "Temperature (°C)" or
    similar)
  - Navigator selection rectangle could have more prominent handles/edges to suggest
    draggability
  - The interactive features in the HTML output (drag/resize) are not fully demonstrable
    in static PNG
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart with mini navigator implementation
    using lets-plot. The main chart (top ~80% of canvas) shows 6 months of daily sensor
    data from July 2025 to December 2025, with values ranging from approximately 18
    to 38. The line is rendered in Python blue (#306998) with a subtle light blue
    area fill beneath. A bold blue annotation at the top shows "Selected Range: Jul
    04, 2025 - Dec 30, 2025". The Y-axis is labeled "Value". Below the main chart
    is a mini navigator (~20% height) showing the full 3-year dataset (2023-2026)
    with a blue selection rectangle highlighting the currently visible range on the
    right side. Both charts share consistent blue styling. The title "line-navigator
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.'
