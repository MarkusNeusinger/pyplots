  image_description: 'The plot displays a bubble chart with approximately 40 data
    points representing tech company metrics. The x-axis shows "Annual Revenue ($B)"
    ranging from ~5 to ~120, and the y-axis shows "Revenue Growth Rate (%)" ranging
    from about -10% to 45%. Bubble sizes represent Market Cap, with a size legend
    in the upper right corner showing three reference sizes: $25B, $100B, and $300B.
    The bubbles are colored using the cividis colormap (dark blue-gray to yellow),
    also mapped to Market Cap, with a vertical colorbar on the right side showing
    values from ~25 to ~225. Top and right spines are removed. Subtle dashed grid
    lines are present. All bubbles have white edge highlighting. The title reads "bubble-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The data shows a clear negative correlation — higher-revenue
    companies tend to have lower growth rates, with smaller high-growth companies
    clustered in the upper-left and larger low-growth companies in the lower-right.'
