review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex faceted grid using Highcharts multi-axis
    capability
  - Clean, realistic plant growth study scenario with meaningful patterns across soil
    types and light conditions
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between soil types
  - Proper use of annotations module for facet labels
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Shared axis scales across all facets enabling direct comparison
  - Well-organized row/column labels identifying each facet
  weaknesses:
  - Text could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800×2700 resolution
  - Uses raw JavaScript/JSON approach rather than highcharts-core Python library as
    suggested in library rules
  - The first subplot row (Sandy soil) in Low light condition shows points clustered
    at lower growth values, which is good for realism but could show wider spread
