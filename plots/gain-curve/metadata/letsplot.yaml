review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the gain curve with all three required reference lines
    (model, random, perfect)
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with theme_minimal and clean styling
  - Good color choices that are colorblind-accessible (blue, gray, yellow)
  - Realistic customer response scenario matching the spec marketing application
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are not visible due to theme_minimal; adding subtle grid would improve
    readability
  - X-axis scale extends slightly beyond 100% which looks unintended
  - Model curve appears stepped/jagged due to discrete data points rather than smoothly
    interpolated
