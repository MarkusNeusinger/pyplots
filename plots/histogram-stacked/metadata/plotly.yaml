review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and balanced layout
  - Proper implementation of stacked histogram using consistent bin edges across all
    groups
  - Realistic manufacturing QC scenario with meaningful overlapping distributions
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Uses manual histogram calculation with go.Bar instead of more idiomatic Plotly
    histogram traces
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive features like custom hover templates
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked histogram showing product weight
    distributions from three production lines. The x-axis shows "Product Weight (g)"
    ranging from approximately 170g to 370g, and the y-axis shows "Frequency" from
    0 to 70. Three distinct colors are used: dark blue (#306998) for Line A at the
    bottom of each stack, yellow (#FFD43B) for Line B in the middle, and teal (#4ECDC4)
    for Line C on top. The title "histogram-stacked · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. A legend in the upper right corner identifies each production line
    with a subtle white background and border. The distributions overlap meaningfully,
    with Line A centered around 250g, Line B around 280g, and Line C around 260g.
    Bars show proper stacking where total height represents combined frequency.'

        comment: Uses go.Bar with barmode="stack" which is correct but basic; could
          leverage plotly.express histogram with color parameter for more idiomatic
          approach, or add hover templates for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
