review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of small multiples approach as spec explicitly allows
    for libraries without animation support
  - Clean grammar of graphics code structure with proper plotnine idioms
  - Good use of California coastline for geographic context
  - Dual encoding (color + size) for magnitude effectively communicates data
  - Realistic earthquake aftershock scenario with appropriate temporal decay pattern
  - Clear title following required format with informative subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Dual legends for the same variable (magnitude) is slightly redundant - could consider
    combining or using only one
  - Some smaller data points in later days could benefit from slightly larger minimum
    size for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x3 small multiples grid showing earthquake
    aftershock sequences across California over 6 days (March 1-6, 2024). Each panel
    contains scattered points representing earthquake locations, with both color and
    size encoding magnitude (ranging from approximately 4 to 10+ on the viridis colormap).
    A simplified California coastline is drawn in dark gray as a path through all
    panels for geographic context. The title reads "Earthquake Aftershock Sequence
    · map-animated-temporal · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the
    visualization. Axis labels show Longitude (°) on x-axis and Latitude (°) on y-axis.
    Two legends appear on the right: a continuous color scale for magnitude and a
    discrete size legend. The progression from Day 1 to Day 6 shows the spatial spread
    of aftershocks expanding from the epicenter, with early days showing concentrated
    clusters and later days showing wider geographic dispersion. Points use alpha=0.7
    transparency.'
