review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom swarm jitter algorithm that creates proper beeswarm layout based
    on local density
  - Strong data storytelling with distinct distribution shapes per department (bimodal
    Sales, tight Engineering, outliers in HR)
  - Good visual design with white point borders, subtle grid, and professional color
    palette
  - Mean markers for each category add statistical context as suggested in spec
  - Proper 4800x2700 sizing with appropriate font sizes for the canvas
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what the horizontal black lines represent (mean markers)
  - Swarm algorithm is implemented manually rather than using a library feature
