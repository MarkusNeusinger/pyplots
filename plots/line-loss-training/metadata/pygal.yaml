review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of overfitting pattern with training loss continuing to
    decrease while validation loss increases after epoch ~25
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - 'Appropriate use of Python brand colors (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B) for visual
    distinction'
  - Good font sizing and spacing for 4800x2700 canvas with customized Style
  - Y-axis label specifies Cross-Entropy Loss as recommended in specification
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned outside plot area in top-left corner appears slightly disconnected
    from the chart
  - 'Optional feature from spec not implemented: marking the epoch with minimum validation
    loss (optimal stopping point)'
  - Grid only shows horizontal lines; vertical guides disabled which reduces readability
    for epoch identification
  image_description: 'The plot displays two line curves on a white background showing
    training loss (blue/Python blue #306998) and validation loss (yellow/Python yellow
    #FFD43B) over 50 epochs. The title "line-loss-training · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center. The x-axis is labeled "Epoch" with tick marks at intervals
    of 5 (5, 10, 15... 50). The y-axis is labeled "Cross-Entropy Loss" ranging from
    approximately 0.2 to 2.4. Both curves start high (~2.3-2.4) and decrease over
    epochs. The training loss (blue) continues decreasing steadily to ~0.1, while
    the validation loss (yellow) begins increasing after around epoch 25, demonstrating
    classic overfitting behavior. A legend appears in the top-left corner outside
    the plot area with colored squares for "Training Loss" and "Validation Loss".
    Data points are marked with small dots along each line. Horizontal grid lines
    are visible at subtle opacity.'
