review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - All text sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700 canvas — fully legible
  - Realistic educational scenario (study hours vs exam scores) with appropriate data
    range
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Subtle grid styling and removed outline border show attention to visual cleanliness
  - HoverTool and HTML export demonstrate awareness of Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add a trend line (e.g., linear regression) with R² annotation
    to guide the viewer interpretation of the correlation'
  - Markers are slightly small for the canvas size — increase to ~40-50 for better
    visibility
  - Visual design is generic — consider adding more refinement such as customized
    tick formatting, background color, or spines removal to elevate beyond default
    appearance
  - The HoverTool adds no value to the PNG output; consider adding annotations or
    other visual elements that are visible in the static image
  - Data lacks interesting outliers or non-linear patterns that would showcase scatter
    plot capabilities more fully
  image_description: The plot displays a basic scatter plot of "Study Hours (hrs)"
    on the x-axis vs "Exam Score (%)" on the y-axis, showing 100 data points with
    a clear positive linear correlation. Points are rendered in a muted steel-blue
    (#306998) with moderate transparency (alpha ~0.7). The title "scatter-basic ·
    bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner in large gray text. Axis labels
    include units. Grid lines are very subtle (low opacity). X-axis ranges from approximately
    1 to 10, Y-axis from approximately 25 to 100. The plot fills the canvas reasonably
    well with balanced margins. No annotations, trend lines, or storytelling elements
    are present. The overall appearance is clean and minimal — a well-configured but
    visually unremarkable scatter plot.
