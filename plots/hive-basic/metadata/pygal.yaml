review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation of hive plot using pygal XY chart as a foundation
  - Well-structured software dependency network data that demonstrates the hive plot
    concept effectively
  - Good use of Bezier curves for edge rendering with appropriate transparency
  - Colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between axes
  - Node labels with degree information provide good context
  weaknesses:
  - Some node labels overlap in the dense center area where axes converge
  - Plot is positioned slightly high on the canvas leaving excess whitespace at bottom
  - Edge bundling mentioned in spec is not implemented (individual curves only)
