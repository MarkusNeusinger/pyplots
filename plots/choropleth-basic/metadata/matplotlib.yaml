review:
  strengths:
  - Creative tile grid map approach that works well without requiring external GIS
    dependencies like geopandas
  - Excellent use of matplotlib patch system (FancyBboxPatch, PatchCollection) for
    custom geographic visualization
  - Smart contrast handling for text labels (white text on dark backgrounds, blue
    text on light backgrounds)
  - Clean visual design with rounded corners and white borders between tiles
  - Colorbar is well-sized and properly labeled with units
  - Realistic population density data that shows meaningful geographic patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Missing Alaska and Hawaii states (only 48 contiguous states shown)
  - No demonstration of missing data handling (spec mentions showing missing data
    as gray or hatched pattern)
  - State abbreviation font size could be slightly larger for better readability at
    full resolution
