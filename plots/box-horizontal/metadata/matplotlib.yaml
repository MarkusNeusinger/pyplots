review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data variety showcasing different distribution types (tight, wide, skewed,
    with outliers)
  - Perfect use of horizontal orientation with readable service type labels
  - 'Strong color scheme using Python colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that is
    colorblind-accessible'
  - Comprehensive matplotlib boxplot customization demonstrating library capabilities
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only on x-axis; adding subtle y-axis grid lines could help visually align
    categories across the plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response times
    (in milliseconds) for 6 different service types. The boxes are rendered in a muted
    blue color (#306998) with yellow/gold median lines (#FFD43B). The y-axis shows
    service categories: Authentication Service, Database Query, File Upload, Payment
    Processing, Email Notification, and Image Processing. The x-axis shows Response
    Time (ms) ranging from approximately 0 to 900+ms. Outliers are displayed as yellow
    circles with blue edges. The plot has a subtle dashed grid on the x-axis. The
    title "box-horizontal · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Each service
    shows different distribution characteristics - Email Notification has a tight
    distribution around 80ms, while Image Processing has a wide uniform spread from
    ~300-800ms. Payment Processing shows right-skewed data with multiple outliers
    extending beyond 800ms.'
