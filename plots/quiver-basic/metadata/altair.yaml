review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of quiver plot in Altair which does not have native arrow
    support
  - Creative solution using rule marks for arrow shafts and arrowheads
  - Good use of viridis colormap for magnitude encoding
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio with appropriate font sizes
  - Clear circular rotation pattern demonstrating vector field concept
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for abstract mathematical coordinates, this is
    acceptable)
  - Grid is slightly too subtle at alpha 0.3
  - Arrowheads at center (low magnitude vectors) are very small and harder to see
  - No tooltips or interactivity despite Altair strength in this area
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 grid of vector arrows showing a circular
    rotation pattern (u = -y, v = x). The arrows form a clear counter-clockwise rotational
    flow around the center. Colors use the viridis colormap, ranging from dark purple
    at the center (low magnitude ~0) through teal/green in the middle to bright yellow
    at the corners (high magnitude ~2.8). The title reads "quiver-basic · altair ·
    pyplots.ai" at the top. X and Y axes are labeled "X Position" and "Y Position"
    respectively, ranging from -2.5 to 2.5. A "Magnitude" legend appears on the right
    side. Arrows have proper arrowheads and uniform spacing across the grid.

        comment: Shows rotation pattern well, magnitude variation from center to edges;
          could show different field patterns but circular rotation is appropriate

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative syntax with mark_rule for arrow construction,
          color encoding with viridis scheme. Creative solution for arrows using rule
          marks with manual arrowhead construction. Could leverage more Altair-specific
          features like interactivity or tooltips.
  verdict: APPROVED
