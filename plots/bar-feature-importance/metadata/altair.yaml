review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the specification with all required features (sorting,
    color gradient, error bars, text annotations)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper layered chart composition
  - Realistic customer analytics context with meaningful feature names
  - Good use of Altair's declarative encoding and color scales
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity at 0.3 could be reduced further (0.2) for subtler appearance
  - Unnecessary plot.html output alongside plot.png
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing feature importance
    values for 15 features from a customer analytics model. Bars are colored using
    a blue sequential gradient (light to dark) based on importance values. Features
    are sorted from lowest importance (social_media_engagement at 0.005) at the top
    to highest importance (customer_lifetime_value at 0.182) at the bottom. Each bar
    has a black error bar showing standard deviation, and importance values are displayed
    as text annotations (3 decimal places) to the right of each bar''s error bar.
    The title "bar-feature-importance · altair · pyplots.ai" is positioned at the
    top-left. Axis labels are clear: "Feature" on y-axis and "Importance Score" on
    x-axis. The grid is subtle with light gray lines.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding, layered chart composition, and
          transform_calculate. Could leverage tooltips more prominently or add interactivity.
