review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot interactive features (tooltips, labels)
  - Clean donut chart design with center label showing total
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic portfolio allocation data
  - Proper HTML export for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: includes "Portfolio Allocation" prefix instead of just
    spec-id format'
  - Missing drill-down functionality to show individual holdings (spec requirement)
  - Legend positioned too far from chart with excessive whitespace on left side
  - Slice percentage labels could be slightly larger for better readability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart showing portfolio allocation
    across four asset classes. The chart uses a 16:9 landscape format with a white
    background. Colors used are: Python Blue (#306998) for Fixed Income (38.0%), Yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Equities (37.0%), Red (#DC2626) for Alternatives (21.0%), and Green
    (#059669) for Cash (4.0%). Each slice displays its percentage label directly on
    or near the slice. A center label reads "Portfolio 100%" in a white rounded rectangle.
    The legend is positioned on the right side showing "Asset Class" with four entries.
    The title "Portfolio Allocation · pie-portfolio-interactive · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. White stroke separates the slices cleanly.'
