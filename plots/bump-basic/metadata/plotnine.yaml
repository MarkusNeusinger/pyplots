review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the bump chart concept with proper Y-axis inversion
  - Smart use of direct labeling (geom_text) instead of legend for cleaner visualization
  - Well-chosen Set2 color palette provides good distinction and colorblind accessibility
  - Data tells a compelling story with varied ranking patterns (leader Alpha Corp,
    volatile Gamma Tech, stable underperformer Epsilon Labs)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha) for a cleaner look
  - Axis labels are functional but could be more descriptive
