review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all required S-N curve features including reference
    lines and region annotations
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: plotLines for reference lines, annotations
    module for region labels'
  - Clean data generation using Basquin equation with realistic scatter
  - Proper logarithmic scales on both axes as required by spec
  - Colorblind-safe color palette
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too prominent (solid dash style visible) - should be more subtle
    with lower opacity
  - LineSeries import from area module is unconventional (should import from line
    module)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) for fatigue analysis
    with a white background. The x-axis shows "Number of Cycles to Failure (N)" on
    a logarithmic scale from 100 to 100M, and the y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)"
    on a logarithmic scale from 140 to 600. Blue circular markers represent test data
    points scattered around a yellow Basquin fit line that slopes downward from left
    to right. Three horizontal dashed reference lines are visible: red at 500 MPa
    (Ultimate Strength), orange at 350 MPa (Yield Strength), and green at 200 MPa
    (Endurance Limit), each with labels on the right side. Three italic region annotations
    appear: "Low-Cycle Fatigue" in the upper left, "High-Cycle Fatigue" in the middle,
    and "Infinite Life" in the lower right. A legend in the upper right shows "Test
    Data" and "Basquin Fit". The title "sn-curve-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top.'
