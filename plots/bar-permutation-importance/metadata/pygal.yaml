review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis color gradient implementation with manual interpolation between
    color stops
  - Clean horizontal bar layout with features sorted by importance (highest at top)
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of pygal Style customization for consistent visual appearance
  - Clever use of formatter callback to show mean ± std in value labels
  - Appropriate canvas size (4800x2700) with adjusted font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing visual error bars - spec requires horizontal error bars to show importance
    variability, but only text labels show std values
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent and could be more subtle
  - X-axis label could benefit from units or clarification that it represents R² score
    decrease
