review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear color differentiation and white edge lines
    separating segments
  - Total value labels above each stack enhance readability and match spec recommendation
  - Proper ordering of products by total sales (largest at bottom) as recommended
    in spec
  - Clean use of seaborn styling (whitegrid, despine, context scaling)
  - Realistic business data scenario with meaningful seasonal variations
  weaknesses:
  - No explicit random seed set (data is deterministic but good practice to include
    np.random.seed(42) for consistency)
  - 'Two blue shades (Electronics #306998 and Home & Garden #4B8BBE) may be difficult
    to distinguish for some colorblind users'
