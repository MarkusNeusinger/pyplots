review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of arc diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics with
    geom_path for arcs
  - Arc heights proportional to node distance as specified, making long-range vs short-range
    connections visually distinct
  - Clean visual design with intentionally hidden axes creating a professional network
    visualization look
  - Good use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) to handle overlapping arcs
  - Weight-based arc thickness adds meaningful data encoding
  - Realistic character interaction scenario with meaningful connection patterns
  weaknesses:
  - The sys.path manipulation at the top is a workaround that could be cleaner
  - Some thin arcs (weight=1) are harder to distinguish from each other
  image_description: The plot displays a basic arc diagram with 10 nodes (Alice, Bob,
    Carol, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Iris, Jack) arranged horizontally along
    a baseline. Yellow circular nodes mark each character's position. Blue semi-transparent
    arcs curve above the baseline connecting various character pairs. Arc heights
    vary proportionally to the distance between connected nodes - the Alice-Jack arc
    spans the full width with the highest peak, while adjacent connections like Bob-Carol
    have small, tight arcs. Arc thickness varies based on connection weight, with
    some arcs thicker than others. The title "Character Interactions · arc-basic ·
    plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. The background is clean white
    with no axis markings or grid.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_path and geom_point effectively; however,
          arc diagrams aren't a native plotnine feature so this is a creative workaround
          rather than leveraging library strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
