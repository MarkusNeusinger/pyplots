review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud on right and rain on left for vertical orientation
  - Uses show_half=1 parameter effectively to create the half-violin cloud effect
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B clearly visible demonstrating plot strength
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with no unnecessary complexity
  - Interactive tooltips defined for HTML export
  - Good use of position_nudge to separate the three elements spatially
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear at higher opacity than subtle 0.2-0.4 range; panel_grid_major_y
    uses color=#cccccc but needs explicit alpha control
  - Does not leverage distinctive lets-plot features beyond basic grammar of graphics
