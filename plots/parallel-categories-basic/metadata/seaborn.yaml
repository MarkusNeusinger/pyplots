review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Titanic-style data as a classic parallel categories example
  - Colorblind-safe seaborn palette properly applied throughout
  - Ribbon widths correctly proportional to observation counts
  - Creative use of seaborn countplot as an inset to add complementary information
  - Clean bezier curve ribbons with good alpha transparency
  - Dimension labels use seaborn palette color for visual consistency
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Some category labels (Queenstown, Cherbourg) appear crowded and overlap with surrounding
    ribbons
  - The inset bar chart slightly crowds the right side of the visualization
  - Middle dimension labels inside narrow category bars are harder to read
  - Code structure is complex with nested loops
