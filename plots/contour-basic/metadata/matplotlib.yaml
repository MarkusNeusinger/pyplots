review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of combined filled contours (contourf) and line contours for visual
    clarity
  - Smart differentiation between minor (50m) and major (200m) contour intervals with
    different line weights
  - Well-labeled major contour lines with readable format
  - Realistic topographic scenario with multiple terrain features (peaks, valley,
    slope)
  - Proper use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean, well-commented code explaining each terrain feature in the elevation model
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - The white valley area created by low elevation values could be confusing - consider
    adjusting the color scale or level range
  - Some contour labels appear in multiple locations which could be reduced for cleaner
    presentation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a contour visualization of a simulated mountain
    terrain. It shows a 10km x 10km area with two distinct peaks: a main peak in the
    northeast (around coordinates 7,7) reaching approximately 1000m elevation (shown
    in bright yellow-green), and a secondary peak in the southwest (around coordinates
    2,3) reaching about 600m (shown in cyan-green). A valley depression runs through
    the center of the map (shown in white/light colors at around 200-300m elevation).
    The viridis colormap transitions from dark purple (low elevations ~200m) through
    blue, green, to yellow (high elevations ~1000m). White contour lines are overlaid
    at 50m intervals, with thicker major contour lines every 200m labeled with elevation
    values (400m, 600m, 800m). A colorbar on the right shows the elevation scale.
    Axis labels indicate "Distance East (km)" and "Distance North (km)" with clear
    tick marks. The title reads "Mountain Terrain · contour-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: No grid present (acceptable for contour plot), but no legend either.
          Colorbar serves as legend but the plot could benefit from annotations for
          peaks.
