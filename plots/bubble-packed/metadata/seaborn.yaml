review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm that produces visually appealing non-overlapping
    bubbles
  - Good use of realistic company market cap data that tells a meaningful story
  - Proper area-based scaling (using sqrt) for accurate visual perception
  - Clean visual design with white edges and appropriate alpha
  - Smart label sizing based on circle radius for readability
  - Color-coded sectors with clear legend
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a function (find_position) which violates KISS principle - should be inline
    or use a simpler iterative approach
  - Does not use any seaborn plotting functions (only styling) - essentially a matplotlib
    implementation with seaborn colors
  - Legend overlaps with Goldman Sachs bubble in lower right corner - needs repositioning
    or smaller legend
  - Some smaller companies (Target, Pfizer) have no labels - could use external annotations
