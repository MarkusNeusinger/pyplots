review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent scientific scenario with realistic earthquake aftershock spreading pattern
  - Clean small multiples layout showing temporal progression clearly
  - Good use of dual encoding (size + color) for magnitude
  - Epicenter marking with distinctive star symbol
  - Consistent axis limits across all panels for easy comparison
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib scatter instead of seaborn plotting functions (only sns styling
    utilities used)
  - Missing geographic basemap/context as requested in spec
  - Epicenter legend not actually displayed (label added but legend not shown)
  - Font sizes could be larger for target resolution
  - Could use viridis or colorblind-friendly palette instead of YlOrRd
  image_description: The plot displays a 2x3 grid of small multiples showing earthquake
    aftershock sequences over 6 days. Each panel shows longitude (-123 to -117) on
    the x-axis and latitude (32 to 38) on the y-axis, with a blue star marking the
    epicenter at approximately (-120, 35). Circular markers represent aftershocks,
    with size encoding magnitude (larger circles = higher magnitude) and color using
    a YlOrRd colormap from pale yellow (magnitude ~2.0) to dark red (magnitude ~5.5).
    A shared vertical colorbar on the right indicates the magnitude scale. The temporal
    evolution shows aftershocks spreading outward from the epicenter as days progress,
    with early days showing clustered high-magnitude events and later days showing
    more dispersed, generally lower-magnitude aftershocks. The overall title follows
    the required format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding.
