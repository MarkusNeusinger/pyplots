review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair transform_calculate for implementing random jitter effect
  - Clean layering approach combining strip chart with mean reference lines
  - Good color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and contrasting yellow mean markers
  - Proper use of configure_axis and configure_view for styling
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful variation between departments
  weaknesses:
  - Mean reference markers lack a legend or annotation explaining what they represent
  - X-axis category labels could benefit from horizontal orientation for better readability
  - Y-axis scale extends significantly below data range (down to 10 when minimum data
    is ~35)
  image_description: The plot displays a strip plot with four departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Support) along the x-axis. Individual data points are shown
    as semi-transparent blue circles (#306998) with horizontal jitter applied to reveal
    distribution density. Yellow horizontal tick marks indicate the group means for
    each department. The y-axis shows "Response Score" ranging from 10 to 110, with
    the actual data spanning approximately 35-100. The title "strip-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A subtle dashed grid aids readability. X-axis
    category labels are rotated at an angle.

        comment: Uses transform_calculate for jitter and layering for mean lines;
          good use of Altair's declarative grammar but could use more interactive
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
