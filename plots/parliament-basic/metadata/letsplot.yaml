review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular seat arrangement algorithm with proper concentric arcs
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics (ggplot, aes, geom_point, theme_void)
  - Legend displays party names with seat counts as specified
  - Majority threshold line and total seats annotation provide useful context
  - Clean visual design with good proportions and spacing
  weaknesses:
  - Uses political party names which violates the content policy (should use neutral
    categories like board members, committee seats, or organization factions)
  - Title uses letsplot instead of lets-plot (should be parliament-basic · lets-plot
    · pyplots.ai)
  - Code uses a function definition which violates KISS principle (should be inline
    code)
  - Two green colors are too similar and could cause accessibility issues for colorblind
    users
