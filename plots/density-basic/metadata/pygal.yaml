review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE using manual Gaussian kernel computation with
    Scott's rule for bandwidth
  - Includes optional rug plot showing individual observations as specified
  - Clean, professional appearance with proper filled density curve
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good data scenario (test scores) that demonstrates left-skewed distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks are quite small and could be more visible (rug_height is only 2% of
    max density)
  - Font sizes in custom_style are scaled up but could benefit from fine-tuning for
    optimal readability
  - Manual KDE computation works but does not leverage any pygal-specific statistical
    features
  image_description: The plot displays a smooth density curve (KDE) filled with a
    blue color (#306998) on a white background. The curve represents test score distribution,
    peaking around 75-77 points with a maximum density of approximately 0.041. A secondary
    shoulder is visible around 60-65 points, demonstrating the left-skewed distribution
    as intended. A rug plot shows individual observations as small vertical marks
    along the x-axis between approximately 50-100. The title "density-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis is labeled "Test Score (points)" ranging
    from ~40 to ~105, and Y-axis shows "Probability Density" from 0 to ~0.04. Subtle
    horizontal grid lines aid readability.
