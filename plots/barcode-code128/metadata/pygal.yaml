review:
  strengths:
  - Creative and technically accurate implementation of Code 128B barcode using pygal
    Bar chart
  - 'Properly implements all Code 128 standard elements: START_B pattern, character
    encoding, modulo 103 checksum, and STOP pattern'
  - Includes proper quiet zones on both sides for scanning reliability
  - Human-readable text displayed below barcode as per specification
  - High contrast black/white design optimal for barcode scanning
  - Excellent use of pygal styling system with custom Style
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (encode_code128b, values_to_bars) which violates KISS principle
    of no functions/classes
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode visualization on a white
    background. At the top is the title "barcode-code128 · pygal · pyplots.ai" in
    black text. The main content is a properly formatted linear barcode consisting
    of vertical black bars of varying widths on a white background, representing the
    encoded text "SHIP-2024-ABC123". The barcode includes quiet zones (white space)
    on both left and right sides. Below the barcode pattern, the human-readable text
    "SHIP-2024-ABC123" is displayed in a monospace-style font. The barcode occupies
    approximately 60% of the canvas width and is well-centered, with appropriate margins.
    The visualization successfully renders a scannable Code 128 barcode pattern with
    all required elements including start pattern, encoded data, checksum, and stop
    pattern.
