review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with web service response times showing mixed
    distribution characteristics
  - Clean ECDF step function with perfect y-axis range (0 to 1) and sensible tick
    marks at quartiles
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good use of theme_minimal() with appropriately sized text elements
  - Correct manual ECDF calculation showing understanding of the algorithm
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (dashed at 0.5 width) making percentile reading difficult
    - the spec notes grid lines should help with reading specific percentile values
