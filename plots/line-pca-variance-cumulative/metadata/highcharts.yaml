review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required features plus the optional bar chart
    overlay for individual variance
  - Threshold crossing points clearly marked with distinctive diamond markers in matching
    colors
  - Highcharts plotLines feature used effectively for threshold reference lines with
    inline labels
  - Realistic industrial sensor data scenario with plausible PCA variance distribution
  - All text sizes explicitly set and readable at 4800x2700
  weaknesses:
  - Right side of the chart has wasted space — threshold labels and legend pushed
    far to the right; consider moving legend inside the plot area or to the bottom
  - Design could be more polished — the default Highcharts axis chrome and grid could
    be refined further for a more publication-ready look
  - The Y-axis max of 110 creates unnecessary empty space above 100%; consider capping
    at 105 or 100 with a small buffer
  - No direct annotation at the elbow point explaining the insight (e.g., 3 components
    capture 90% of variance) which would strengthen the data storytelling
  image_description: The plot displays a combination column-and-line chart on a white
    background. Light blue semi-transparent columns show the individual explained
    variance for each of 12 PCA components (component 1 ~48%, component 2 ~31%, declining
    rapidly to near-zero for components 5-12). A blue line with filled circle markers
    traces the cumulative explained variance, starting at ~48% and reaching ~100%
    by component 12. Two horizontal dashed orange lines mark the 90% and 95% variance
    thresholds, with right-aligned labels ("90% Threshold" in orange, "95% Threshold"
    in purple). An orange diamond marker highlights the 90% crossing at component
    3, and a purple diamond marker highlights the 95% crossing at component 4. The
    legend is positioned in the upper-right corner listing all four series. The title
    reads "PCA Component Selection · line-pca-variance-cumulative · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    with a subtitle "Industrial Sensor Data (12 features → explained variance by principal
    components)". X-axis is labeled "Number of Components" (1-12), Y-axis is "Explained
    Variance (%)" (0-110).
