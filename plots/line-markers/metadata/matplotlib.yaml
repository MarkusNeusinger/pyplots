review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent marker visibility with white edge borders creating strong contrast against
    lines
  - Three distinct marker shapes (circle, square, triangle) for easy series differentiation
  - Realistic weather station scenario with plausible temperature ranges
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate filled vs unfilled markers as suggested in spec notes for additional
    distinction
  - Legend placement inside plot area could potentially overlap with data in edge
    cases
  - Does not leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like annotations or custom
    styling
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a line chart showing temperature readings (°C) over 14 days from three weather stations. Three distinct lines with markers are shown:
    - **Coastal Station** (blue circles): Highest temperatures, ranging from ~18°C to ~22°C, showing an upward trend mid-period then declining
    - **Inland Station** (yellow squares): Mid-range temperatures, starting at ~13°C and declining to ~7°C over the period
    - **Mountain Station** (red triangles): Lowest temperatures, ranging from ~6°C to ~10°C with a general downward trend

    The title follows the required format "line-markers · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Axis labels are "Day" (x-axis) and "Temperature (°C)" (y-axis). A legend is positioned in the upper left. Grid lines are visible with subtle alpha. Markers are clearly visible with white edge borders for contrast. The layout is well-balanced with good use of the 16:9 canvas.
