review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of synchronized crosshair using Plotly native hovermode=x
    unified and spike lines
  - Clean three-panel layout with appropriate row heights (50%/25%/25%)
  - RSI reference lines at 70/30 add meaningful context to the technical indicator
  - Proper use of make_subplots with shared_xaxes for true synchronization
  - Good font sizing throughout for readability at target resolution
  - HTML export enables interactive exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green reference lines for RSI overbought/oversold may be problematic for colorblind
    users - consider using different dash patterns or labels
  - Legend disabled entirely - could benefit from trace names in the unified tooltip
  image_description: The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with three
    vertically stacked panels sharing a common x-axis (Date from Jan 2024 to Oct 2024).
    The top panel shows a blue line chart of Price ($) ranging from ~85 to ~107, displaying
    a stock-like random walk pattern. The middle panel shows yellow/gold bar chart
    for Volume ranging from 0 to ~1.5M with consistent density throughout. The bottom
    panel shows an RSI Indicator as a blue line oscillating between 0-100, with dashed
    horizontal reference lines at 70 (red, overbought) and 30 (green, oversold). The
    title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top. All charts share aligned x-axis ticks and have subtle gray grid lines.
    The layout proportions are 50%/25%/25% for the three rows.
