review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy.signal.spectrogram for proper FFT-based spectrogram computation
  - Viridis colormap is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended in
    spec
  - dB scale conversion (10 * log10) provides better dynamic range visualization
  - Clean chirp signal generation with appropriate parameters demonstrates frequency
    sweep clearly
  - Proper axis labels with units (seconds, Hz, dB) as specified
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good text sizing for legibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Interactive HTML output also generated
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to help read values at specific time-frequency points
  - Y-axis shows 0-500 Hz but chirp only goes to 200 Hz, wasting some visual space
  - Could benefit from minor grid for easier value reading on the heatmap
