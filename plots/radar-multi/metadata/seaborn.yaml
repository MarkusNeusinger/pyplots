review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the spec-compliant title format
  - Clean, readable axis labels positioned well around the perimeter
  - Good color choices with Python Blue as primary color and accessible complementary
    colors
  - Proper polygon closure with both fill (alpha=0.25) and outline (linewidth=3, markers)
  - Appropriate use of square figure format for radar chart
  - Clean seaborn styling with whitegrid theme and talk context
  weaknesses:
  - Data values are somewhat tightly clustered (65-90 range) which reduces the visual
    impact of comparing products - more dramatic variation would better showcase the
    radar chart strengths
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart with a square (1:1)
    aspect ratio. Three overlapping polygons represent Product A (blue/Python Blue
    #306998), Product B (yellow #FFD43B), and Product C (red/coral #E74C3C). The chart
    has 6 axes radiating from the center: Performance, Value, Support, Features, Usability,
    and Reliability. Each axis is clearly labeled at the outer edge with readable
    black text. The radial gridlines show scale markers at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100
    in gray. The title "radar-multi · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold. A legend in the upper right corner identifies all three products. The polygons
    use fill with ~25% transparency and solid outlines with markers at data points.
    The chart uses a white background with subtle dashed gridlines.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_style and sns.set_context for global styling, but core
          radar chart is built with matplotlib's polar projection. Seaborn doesn't
          have native radar chart support, so this is appropriate use of seaborn for
          styling while leveraging matplotlib for the specialized polar plot.
  verdict: APPROVED
