review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stacked areas with confidence bands using plotnine
    grammar of graphics
  - Clean, readable code structure with well-organized data preparation
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical for legend ordering
  - Growing uncertainty over time reflects realistic forecast behavior
  - Good color scheme with Python-themed blue and complementary colors
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence bands overlap significantly where layers meet, making individual series
    uncertainty hard to distinguish
  - Could use plotnine-specific statistical features for added value
  - The lighter confidence band alpha (0.25) combined with the main area alpha (0.7)
    creates some visual confusion in overlapping regions
  image_description: The plot displays a stacked area chart showing energy consumption
    forecasts by source (Solar, Wind, Hydro) over 20 quarters. The bottom layer is
    Solar (yellow/gold), middle layer is Wind (dark blue), and top layer is Hydro
    (teal/cyan). Each layer has a confidence band shown as a lighter shade extending
    above and below the main area. The x-axis shows "Quarter" (1-19 in odd increments),
    y-axis shows "Energy Consumption (TWh)" (0-400). The title correctly uses the
    format "area-stacked-confidence · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold. A legend on
    the right identifies the three energy sources with "(with 90% CI)" label. The
    plot uses a minimal theme with a light background and subtle grid lines.
