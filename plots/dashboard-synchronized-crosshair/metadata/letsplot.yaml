review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  - Excellent data generation mimicking realistic stock market data with correlated
    volume
  - RSI chart includes proper overbought/oversold threshold lines (70/30)
  - Good use of gggrid for vertical stacking with shared x-axis alignment
  - Appropriate color choices that are colorblind-friendly
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided
  weaknesses:
  - Missing synchronized crosshair demonstration - the spec explicitly requires showing
    crosshairs for static output via annotations
  - Did not utilize lets-plot interactive tooltip features (tooltip parameter, layer_tooltips)
    in the HTML version
  - Did not use geom_vline or annotations to demonstrate a sample crosshair position
    at a specific date
  - Chart heights are equal when price chart typically deserves more vertical space
    in financial dashboards
  image_description: The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with three
    vertically stacked charts sharing a common x-axis (Date from January to October).
    The top chart shows a Price line chart in blue (#306998) with values ranging from
    approximately $85 to $110, displaying typical stock price volatility with a random
    walk pattern. The middle chart shows Volume as yellow/gold (#FFD43B) vertical
    bars with semi-transparency (alpha=0.8), ranging from 0 to about 1.3 million.
    The bottom chart shows an RSI Indicator as a red (#DC2626) line oscillating between
    approximately 20-85, with dashed horizontal reference lines at RSI levels 30 and
    70 (overbought/oversold thresholds). All three charts share aligned x-axis gridlines,
    have light gray grid styling, and the overall title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The charts use independent y-axis
    scales as required by the specification.
