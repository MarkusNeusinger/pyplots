review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Well-implemented contour labels with proper font size and white color for visibility
  - Mathematical peaks function creates visually interesting surface with multiple
    local minima/maxima
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack domain-specific context or units (e.g., could be "X Position
    (units)" for a realistic scenario)
  - Data context is purely mathematical rather than tied to a real-world application
    from the spec examples
