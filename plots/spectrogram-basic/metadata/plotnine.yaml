review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of chirp signal with frequency increasing over time
  - Proper use of dB scale for power representation
  - Well-formatted title following spec format exactly
  - Good axis labels with units as specified
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Clean, readable KISS code structure
  - Appropriate colormap that is perceptually reasonable
  weaknesses:
  - Custom color gradient could use a more perceptually uniform colormap like viridis
    (spec recommends viridis/inferno)
  - No grid lines to aid in reading specific time-frequency values
  - Frequency axis filtered to 500 Hz when chirp only reaches 200 Hz - could be tighter
    range for better visualization
