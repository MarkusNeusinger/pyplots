review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all elements clearly legible at full resolution
  - Clean, professional styling with removed spines and subtle gridlines
  - Value labels above bars enhance readability and follow spec recommendation
  - Proper use of seaborn DataFrame integration with pandas
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate more variation in data values to better showcase comparison
    capabilities
  - Does not leverage seaborn-specific features beyond basic barplot (e.g., error
    bars, hue encoding for highlighting)
