review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent split violin implementation with clean visual separation between before/after
    groups
  - Quartile markers (median and Q1/Q3) add statistical context as suggested in the
    spec
  - Colorblind-safe Python blue and yellow color scheme with good contrast
  - Custom KDE implementation avoids scipy dependency while producing smooth distributions
  - Realistic employee training scenario with department-specific variations in improvement
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears small and could benefit from larger glyph sizes or repositioning
    closer to the plot
  - KDE smoothing causes some distributions to extend slightly beyond the 1-10 scale
    boundaries
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool for interactivity
