review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot's native geom_area_ridges for true ridgeline visualization
  - Clean, publication-quality appearance with well-chosen Spectral color palette
  - Thoughtful data generation with realistic Northern hemisphere temperature patterns
    (varying means and stds)
  - Proper month ordering (reversed for bottom-to-top display) with correct categorical
    handling
  - Good overlap parameter (scale=1.2) creating visual cohesion without obscuring
    distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical grid lines could be made subtler or removed for a cleaner ridgeline aesthetic
  - Color palette (Spectral) is not fully colorblind-accessible; viridis or a sequential
    palette could improve accessibility
  image_description: The plot displays a ridgeline visualization showing monthly temperature
    distributions arranged vertically from January at the top to December at the bottom.
    The distributions are rendered as smooth density curves with partial overlap,
    creating the characteristic "mountain ridge" appearance. The Spectral color palette
    is used, transitioning from purple/magenta tones for winter months (January, February,
    December) through blue (March), teal/green (April, May), yellow-green (June, July,
    August), and orange/coral (September, October, November). Each ridge has a white
    border outline and semi-transparent fill. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)"
    ranging from approximately -14 to 32, and month names are displayed on the y-axis.
    The title reads "Monthly Temperature Distribution · ridgeline-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" at the top.
