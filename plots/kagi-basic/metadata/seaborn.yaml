review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Kagi chart algorithm with proper yang/yin classification
    based on price exceeding previous highs/lows
  - Clean visual distinction between bullish (thick green) and bearish (thin red)
    segments
  - Proper use of seaborn theming (whitegrid, talk context) for publication-quality
    appearance
  - Well-structured code with clear segment-building logic
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Feature coverage could be improved - the generated data produces mostly yang segments
    with relatively few yin transitions, making it harder to see the bearish behavior
  - Grid styling in the rendered output shows dashed lines despite code setting solid
    linestyle
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart showing stock price movements
    over approximately 21 Kagi line segments. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from approximately $77 to $115, and the X-axis shows "Kagi Line Index" from 0
    to 20. Green thick lines (linewidth=5) represent Yang (Bullish) segments indicating
    uptrends, while red thin lines (linewidth=2) represent Yin (Bearish) segments
    indicating downtrends. The chart correctly uses vertical lines for price movements
    and horizontal lines for reversals/transitions. A well-placed legend in the upper
    left corner clearly identifies "Yang (Bullish)" and "Yin (Bearish)" segments.
    The title "kagi-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently at the
    top in bold. The background uses a subtle white grid with light gray gridlines.
    The overall layout is clean with good use of canvas space.
