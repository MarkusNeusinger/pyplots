review:
  strengths:
  - Implements complete Code 128B encoding algorithm from scratch with proper start/stop
    patterns and check digit calculation
  - Clean, high-contrast visualization with proper quiet zones for scannability
  - Human-readable text positioned correctly below the barcode
  - Deterministic output with no random elements
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Barcode could be slightly larger to better utilize canvas space
  - Only demonstrates Code 128B subset; could show subset switching capability
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode on a clean white background.
    At the top center is the title "barcode-code128 · plotly · pyplots.ai" in dark
    gray text. The barcode itself consists of black vertical bars of varying widths
    arranged in the characteristic Code 128 pattern, encoding the string "PYPLOTS-2024".
    The barcode is horizontally centered and occupies roughly 40% of the canvas width.
    Below the barcode is the human-readable text "PYPLOTS-2024" in a monospace Courier
    font, centered beneath the bars. The overall layout has adequate quiet zones (white
    space) on both sides of the barcode. The axes are hidden, creating a clean presentation
    suitable for a barcode visualization.
