review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with two well-placed annotations highlighting the
    bimodal distribution and Treatment A improvement
  - 'Clean visual refinement: subtle grid, removed spines, white-filled box plots
    with colored edges, edge-highlighted rain points'
  - 'Correct raincloud metaphor: clouds above baseline, rain below, box plots centered'
  - Bimodal Treatment B distribution demonstrates the raison d'être of raincloud plots
  - Custom cohesive color palette that is colorblind-friendly
  weaknesses:
  - Some wasted vertical space above Treatment B (y-limit at 2.6 could be tighter)
  - Box plot coloring logic relies on fragile internal matplotlib structure (counting
    5 lines per box)
  - Rain points use matplotlib scatter instead of seaborn stripplot, missing more
    idiomatic seaborn usage
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud visualization with
    three conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction
    Time (ms) on the x-axis, ranging roughly from 280 to 570 ms. Each condition uses
    a distinct color: Control in blue (#306998), Treatment A in gold/amber (#E6A800),
    and Treatment B in green (#4DAF4A). For each category, a half-violin (cloud) extends
    upward above the baseline, a white-filled box plot with colored edges sits on
    the baseline, and jittered scatter points (rain) fall below the baseline. Treatment
    B clearly shows a bimodal distribution in its cloud shape, with an annotation
    "Bimodal distribution revealed by raincloud" connected by an arrow. Treatment
    A has an annotation "~59 ms faster than Control" with an arrow pointing to its
    median area. The title reads "raincloud-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in the correct
    format. X-axis gridlines are subtle dashed lines. Top and right spines are removed.
    The layout is well-proportioned with good use of canvas space.'
