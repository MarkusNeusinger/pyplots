review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear percentage labels inside each segment
  - Smart text color adaptation (white on dark colors, dark on yellow) for readability
  - Clean, realistic market share data showing meaningful trends over time
  - Proper normalization to percentages with clear y-axis labeling
  - Good use of colorblind-friendly color palette
  - Appropriate font sizes for the canvas resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Implementation primarily uses matplotlib for plotting (ax.bar) with seaborn only
    used for sns.despine() styling - should leverage seaborn native bar plotting functions
    more
  - Legend placement outside the plot creates additional whitespace on the right side
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a 100% stacked bar chart displaying market share data across 6 quarters (Q1 2023 to Q2 2024) for 4 companies. Each bar reaches exactly 100% and is divided into 4 colored segments:
    - **Company A** (dark blue, #306998) - at the bottom, declining from 35% to 24%
    - **Company B** (yellow, #FFD43B) - second from bottom, growing from 25% to 34%
    - **Company C** (teal, #4ECDC4) - third segment, growing slightly from 22% to 27%
    - **Company D** (coral/salmon, #E76F51) - top segment, declining from 18% to 15%

    The title reads "bar-stacked-percent · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. X-axis shows "Quarter" with 6 quarter labels, Y-axis shows "Market Share (%)" from 0-100. Percentage labels are displayed inside each segment (white text on dark colors, dark text on yellow). The legend is positioned outside the plot on the upper right. A subtle horizontal grid is visible. The layout is clean and professional.

        comment: Only uses sns.despine() from seaborn; the actual plotting is done
          with matplotlib's ax.bar(). This is a significant weakness as the implementation
          could leverage seaborn's native bar plotting capabilities more.
  verdict: APPROVED
