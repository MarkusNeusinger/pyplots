review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of small multiples approach for static progressive reveal
  - Clear visual indicator (yellow highlighted point) showing current position in
    each stage
  - Consistent axis limits across all panels enables easy comparison
  - Realistic temperature data with seasonal pattern demonstrates the plot type well
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seaborn/pandas integration
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses alpha=0.3 which is slightly prominent; could be more subtle
    (0.2)
  - Missing legend explaining what the yellow marker represents (though visually intuitive)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x3 grid of small multiples showing the
    progressive reveal of a temperature time series over 24 months. Each panel ("Month
    4", "Month 8", "Month 12", "Month 16", "Month 20", "Month 24") shows an increasing
    portion of the data. The line is rendered in Python blue (#306998) with blue circular
    markers at each data point. The most recent point in each panel is highlighted
    with a larger yellow (#FFD43B) marker with a blue edge, clearly indicating the
    "current" position. The data shows a seasonal sinusoidal pattern (temperature
    cycling between ~5°C and ~30°C) with a slight warming trend. All panels share
    consistent axis limits (x: -1 to 25, y: 0 to 35), a subtle dashed grid, and proper
    axis labels with units ("Month" and "Temperature (°C)"). The main title correctly
    follows the format "line-animated-progressive · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
