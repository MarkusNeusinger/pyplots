review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a boxen plot using plotnine grammar of graphics despite
    lacking native geom_boxen support
  - 'Data demonstrates all key aspects of boxen plots: different distribution shapes,
    visible quantile nesting, and outlier detection'
  - Clean blue gradient color scheme that is colorblind-safe
  - Realistic server response time scenario with 2000 points per category
  - Proper use of nested boxes with decreasing widths for deeper quantiles
  - Clear legend explaining quantile level percentages
  weaknesses:
  - Color gradient between quantile levels could have more contrast to better distinguish
    nested boxes
  - Manual implementation adds code complexity (though unavoidable for plotnine)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a boxen plot (letter-value plot) showing server
    response times across four endpoints: API, Database, Cache, and Auth. Each category
    has nested rectangular boxes representing different quantile levels, colored in
    a gradient from dark blue (innermost, representing 25%-75%) to light blue (outermost,
    representing 0.4%-99.6%). The boxes decrease in width for deeper quantiles as
    expected. A white horizontal line marks the median in each box. Outliers are shown
    as semi-transparent blue points above the main boxes, particularly visible for
    the API endpoint (ranging up to ~500ms) and to a lesser extent for Database and
    Auth. The Cache endpoint shows a tight, low distribution with few outliers. The
    x-axis is labeled "Endpoint" with category names (API, Database, Cache, Auth),
    and the y-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to about 500. A
    legend on the right explains the quantile levels. The title follows the required
    format: "boxen-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle and the overall
    layout is well-balanced.'
