review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of grouped lollipop pattern with clear visual separation
    between groups
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, Legend construction, ticker
    customization'
  - Well-chosen colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Appropriate sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas with readable text at all sizes
  - Clean, maintainable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears slightly clipped at the right edge of the plot
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool for tooltips
  - Data values are somewhat clustered (35-91 range), could show more dramatic differences
  image_description: The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across four regions (North, South, East, West). Each region
    has four vertical lollipops arranged side by side representing Electronics (blue),
    Clothing (yellow), Food (green), and Home (purple). Thin stems extend from the
    baseline (y=0) to circular markers at the respective revenue values. The legend
    is positioned in the top-right corner with clear labels identifying each product
    line. The title "lollipop-grouped · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold. Axes are labeled "Region" (x-axis) and "Revenue ($ Million)" (y-axis). Grid
    lines are subtle and dashed with 0.3 alpha. The background is a light gray (#fafafa)
    with white border fill. The plot fills the 4800x2700 canvas well with balanced
    margins and good visual separation between the four regional groups.
