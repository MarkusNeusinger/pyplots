quality_score: 88
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semantic ring coloring (green to yellow to orange to pink) that visually
    reinforces the adopt-to-hold progression
  - Sophisticated label repulsion algorithm that iteratively pushes overlapping labels
    apart, with connector lines maintaining point-to-label association
  - 'Full spec compliance: 270-degree arc, 4 rings, 4 sectors, 24 labeled innovations,
    background fills, legend, all present'
  - 'Leverages lets-plot distinctive features: layer_tooltips for interactive HTML,
    geom_label with background fill'
  - Highly realistic data with plausible technology-to-ring assignments
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear section comments
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation item label font size (10) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at a glance
  - Minor label crowding near sector boundaries where items from adjacent sectors
    have labels that approach each other
  - Green (#22A06B) vs orange (#E56910) distinction could be marginally improved for
    deuteranopia viewers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree innovation radar on a white background
    with the title "radar-innovation-timeline · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold at
    the top-left. Four concentric rings represent time horizons: "Adopt" (innermost,
    light green fill), "Trial" (light yellow), "Assess" (light orange), and "Hold"
    (outermost, light pink). Ring labels appear in white boxes at the top gap of the
    arc. Four angular sectors divide the radar: "AI & ML" (left, blue), "Biotech"
    (bottom-left, deep pink), "Sustainability" (bottom-right, green), and "Infrastructure"
    (right, orange). Sector names appear in large bold text along the outer edge.
    24 color-coded innovation items are plotted as dots within their respective ring/sector
    positions, each connected to its text label by a thin gray connector line. Labels
    are positioned outward with left/right alignment depending on side. A legend at
    the bottom maps colors to sectors. The overall layout is clean and well-balanced
    with minimal overlap between labels.'

        comment: All font sizes explicitly set (title=24, sectors=15, rings=12, items=10,

        comment: Radar fills ~55% of canvas. Balanced margins. Some whitespace at

        comment: No traditional axes (appropriate for radar). Ring and sector labels
          serve as axis equivalents. Title format correct.
