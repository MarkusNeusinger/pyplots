review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including sorted horizontal
    bars, color gradient, error bars, and value annotations
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic ML model context with credit/loan prediction features
  - Good visual hierarchy with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper positioning of annotations after error bars to avoid overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Layout margins are somewhat generous on the left side; could utilize canvas space
    slightly better
  - Y-axis label "Feature" could be omitted since the feature names are self-explanatory
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features in the HTML output (hover
    templates, custom interactions)
