review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Highcharts dataLabels with allowOverlap: false to prevent label
    collisions'
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color choice and transparency
  - 'Good text outline (textOutline: 3px white) ensures label readability over grid
    lines'
  - Realistic tech company business context that demonstrates the annotation use case
    well
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw JSON dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python classes as
    shown in library rules
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (alpha 0.15 is quite faint)
  - Some labels could benefit from smart positioning (e.g., labels near axis edges
    like DataFlow appear slightly cramped)
