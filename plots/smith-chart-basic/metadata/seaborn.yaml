review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Smith chart grid implementation with proper constant R circles and X
    arc mathematics
  - Smart label positioning with explicit offsets prevents overlapping frequency labels
  - Good use of VSWR circle as optional feature from spec
  - Realistic RF engineering data with antenna-like impedance trajectory
  - Proper normalization to Z0=50 ohm reference impedance
  - Clean color scheme with good contrast between different elements
  - Custom legend explaining all chart components
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn usage is minimal - only lineplot and scatterplot for the impedance locus
    while all grid lines use matplotlib directly; more seaborn integration would better
    demonstrate library capabilities
  - Legend line styles dont perfectly match rendered elements (solid vs alpha-blended)
  - Some reactance labels extend slightly outside the unit circle making them harder
    to read
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance visualization
    on a square canvas. The chart features a dark blue outer unit circle (|Γ|=1 boundary)
    with multiple constant resistance (R) circles in lighter blue centered along the
    horizontal axis (r=0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 labeled). Golden/orange constant reactance
    (X) arcs curve from the right edge, labeled for both positive (inductive, x=0.2,
    0.5, 1, 2) and negative (capacitive, x=-0.2, -0.5, -1, -2) values. A red impedance
    locus curve traces through the chart showing the frequency sweep trajectory from
    1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz, with 5 red circular markers at key frequency points (1.0,
    2.2, 3.6, 4.8, 6.0 GHz) with bold dark labels. A green "+" marker indicates the
    matched condition Z₀ (50Ω) at the center. A dashed purple VSWR 3:1 circle is drawn
    at |Γ|=0.5 with a purple label. The legend in the upper left shows all four elements.
    Axes are labeled Real(Γ) and Imag(Γ). Title follows the required format: "smith-chart-basic
