review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of synchronized crosshair visualization across three
    charts
  - Good use of gggrid with height ratios (2:1:1) for proper visual hierarchy
  - Appropriate color choices with good contrast (blue, yellow, red)
  - RSI chart includes meaningful reference lines at 30 and 70
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided for static and interactive use
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial data scenario with price, volume, and technical indicator
  weaknesses:
  - Title appears at very top in relatively small font; could be more prominent
  - No formal legend element (only caption text explaining crosshair)
  image_description: 'The dashboard displays three vertically stacked charts sharing
    a common x-axis (Date, Jan-Oct 2024). The top chart shows Price ($) as a blue
    line ranging from ~$80 to $110. The middle chart displays Volume (M) as yellow/gold
    bars ranging from 0 to ~1.2M. The bottom chart shows the RSI Indicator as a red
    line with dashed gray horizontal reference lines at 30 and 70 (overbought/oversold
    thresholds). A synchronized pink/magenta vertical crosshair line spans all three
    charts at 2024-05-20, with pink circular markers and value annotations at each
    intersection point: "$85.91" for price, "1.24M" for volume, and "47.8" for RSI.
    The overall title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. A caption at the bottom of the RSI chart indicates "■ Synchronized
    crosshair at 2024-05-20".'
