review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of seaborn scatterplot to build gauge arc with dense point markers
  - Excellent colorblind accessibility using seaborn built-in colorblind palette
  - Clean white zone boundary lines for visual separation
  - Prominent value display with appropriate text sizing
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced layout
  - Realistic sales performance context
  weaknesses:
  - Zone labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Needle tip marker (red triangle) adds visual interest but is unconventional for
    gauge charts
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart showing "Sales
    Performance" at 72%. The gauge has three colored zones: a red/coral "Low" zone
    on the left (0-30), an orange "Medium" zone in the middle (30-70), and a green
    "High" zone on the right (70-100). A dark blue needle points to 72, which is in
    the High zone. The needle has a red triangular tip for visibility. The value "72%"
    is prominently displayed below the gauge in large blue text. Zone labels ("Low",
    "Medium", "High") are displayed in white with dark outlines on their respective
    colored zones. Min (0) and max (100) values are labeled at the gauge endpoints.
    The title "gauge-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, with "Sales
    Performance" as a subtitle below. The background is clean white.'

        comment: Uses seaborn scatterplot, lineplot, and colorblind palette creatively
          for gauge construction. However, this is a creative workaround since seaborn
          doesn't have native gauge support.
  verdict: APPROVED
