review:
  strengths:
  - Correct RSI calculation using EMA method with 14-period lookback
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels
  - Good use of dashed lines for threshold visualization
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Zone shading (overbought 70-100 red, oversold 0-30 green) is not visible in output
    despite being coded - the fill=True approach creates filled area from 0 to the
    line value, not a horizontal band
  - RSI data never enters overbought zone (>70) - maximum value is approximately 66,
    missing half of the key feature demonstration
  - Legend is incomplete - zone fill series entries not showing
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) line chart
    on a white background. The blue RSI line oscillates between approximately 26 and
    66 over 120 trading periods, using cubic interpolation for smooth curves. Horizontal
    dashed reference lines are present: green at 70 (overbought threshold), red at
    30 (oversold threshold), and gray at 50 (centerline). The Y-axis is correctly
    fixed from 0 to 100 with label "RSI Value (0-100)". The X-axis shows "Trading
    Period (120 days, 14-period RSI lookback)". Title correctly formatted as "indicator-rsi
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". Legend at bottom shows RSI (14), Overbought (70), Oversold
    (30), and Centerline (50). However, the overbought/oversold zone shading is NOT
    visible despite being coded, and the RSI line never enters the overbought zone
    (>70).'
