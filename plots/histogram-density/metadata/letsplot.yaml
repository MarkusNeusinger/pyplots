review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with proper ..density.. stat transformation
  - Clean addition of fitted normal distribution PDF overlay using scipy.stats
  - 'Appropriate color scheme (#306998 blue bars, #FFD43B yellow line) with good contrast'
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-like grammar with theme customization
  - Bimodal data distribution effectively demonstrates density normalization concept
  - Correct figure sizing (1600x900 base with scale=3) and text sizing per library
    guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could specify Test Score points or Density probability
    per unit)
  - A legend explaining the yellow line as Fitted Normal Distribution would add clarity
  - Could leverage more distinctive lets-plot features like scale_fill_* or tooltip
    configuration
  image_description: The plot displays a density histogram of test scores. Blue bars
    (#306998) with white borders represent the histogram bins showing the distribution
    of scores from approximately 40-105 on the X-axis, with density values (0-0.042)
    on the Y-axis. A smooth yellow/gold (#FFD43B) theoretical normal distribution
    curve overlays the histogram, showing a fit centered around 75. The distribution
    is slightly right-skewed with a visible bump around 85-90 representing high performers.
    The title reads "histogram-density · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The background is
    white with subtle gray grid lines. Text is clearly readable with appropriate font
    sizes.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with `geom_histogram`, `..density..`
          stat, `theme_minimal()`, and `ggsize()`. Good use of grammar of graphics
          but doesn't leverage more distinctive lets-plot features like interactivity
          configuration or color scales
  verdict: APPROVED
