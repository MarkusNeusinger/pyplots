review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 3D bars using Mesh3d with proper vertex and face definitions
  - Good color scheme following Python-inspired palette that is colorblind-safe
  - Interactive hover templates with detailed information (product, quarter, sales
    value)
  - Dual output format (PNG + HTML) leveraging Plotly interactive capabilities
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal sales patterns (Q4 holiday boost)
  - Semi-transparent bars (opacity=0.9) help with depth perception
  weaknesses:
  - Legend marker style (circular) does not match the bar chart style
  - Some minor occlusion of back rows inherent to 3D visualization could be mitigated
    with more transparency
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D bar chart showing quarterly sales data
    across 5 product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Food, Home, Sports). The bars
    rise from a 2D plane with product categories on the x-axis and quarters (Q1-Q4)
    on the y-axis. Bar heights represent sales values in thousands of dollars (z-axis
    labeled "Sales ($K)"). Colors range from dark blue (Electronics) through lighter
    blues (Clothing, Food) to yellow tones (Home, Sports), following a Python-inspired
    color scheme. The title "bar-3d · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    A legend in the upper right identifies each product category. The 3D perspective
    clearly shows Electronics having the highest sales overall with a notable Q4 holiday
    boost pattern visible across categories.
