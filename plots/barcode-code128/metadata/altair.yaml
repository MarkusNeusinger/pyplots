review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Code 128 encoding algorithm with proper start code,
    check digit calculation, and stop pattern
  - Clean, readable barcode with proper quiet zones for scan reliability
  - Human-readable text positioned correctly below barcode
  - High contrast black/white design suitable for actual scanning
  - Well-structured code with comprehensive encoding tables
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate Code 128 subset switching (A/B/C) for more comprehensive coverage
  - Library features score could be higher with interactive tooltips or zoom capability
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode visualization on a white
    background. At the top is the title "barcode-code128 · altair · pyplots.ai" in
    black text. The main barcode consists of alternating black vertical bars of varying
    widths arranged horizontally across the center of the image, representing the
    encoded data "SHIP-2024-ABC123". The barcode includes proper quiet zones (white
    space) on both left and right sides. Below the barcode, the human-readable text
    "SHIP-2024-ABC123" is displayed in a bold monospace font, centered under the bars.
    The overall layout is clean with high contrast black on white, and the barcode
    occupies a good portion of the canvas area.
