review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear distinction between 3×3 box boundaries and
    cell boundaries
  - Numbers are large, bold, and highly readable with good color contrast
  - Clean monochrome design suitable for printing as specified
  - Uses square figure format (3600×3600 px equivalent) which is ideal for a Sudoku
    grid
  - Proper handling of empty cells (displayed as blank, not zeros)
  - Title follows correct format specification
  weaknesses:
  - Minimal use of seaborn distinctive features - sns.heatmap is only used to create
    a blank white grid, with all meaningful visualization done via matplotlib
  image_description: The plot displays a standard 9×9 Sudoku grid with clean visual
    hierarchy. The background is white with light gray thin lines separating individual
    cells. Thick black lines clearly separate the nine 3×3 box regions. Numbers are
    displayed in a blue color (#306998), bold, and centered within their cells. Empty
    cells are shown as blank (no zeros displayed). The title "sudoku-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in the same blue color. The grid is perfectly
    square with proper proportions, and all numbers are clearly readable.

        comment: Uses sns.heatmap as a base, but only for creating a blank grid structure.
          The actual visualization (numbers, thick lines) is done entirely with matplotlib.
          Seaborn is used minimally - just for set_style, set_context, and an all-white
          heatmap. This doesn't leverage seaborn's distinctive statistical visualization
          capabilities.
  verdict: APPROVED
