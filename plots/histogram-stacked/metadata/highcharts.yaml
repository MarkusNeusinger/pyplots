review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between all three
    groups
  - Proper implementation of stacked histogram using common bin edges calculated from
    combined data
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-sized text elements for high-resolution
    output
  - Correct title format and meaningful subtitle adding context
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like plot_options stacking configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Output image height is 2561px instead of the expected 2700px (minor dimension
    mismatch)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could be "Measurement Range (units)" and "Frequency
    (count)")
