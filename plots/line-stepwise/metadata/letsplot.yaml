review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step line visualization with clear horizontal-then-vertical transitions
    using direction=hv
  - Points overlay on steps helps identify exact data points at each hour
  - Good color scheme with Python-inspired blue and yellow that is colorblind accessible
  - Realistic server response time monitoring scenario that demonstrates discrete
    state changes
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line color could be slightly more subtle
  - Points at every hour are slightly redundant - could highlight only the change
    points
  - Data pattern is somewhat predictable with changes only at specific scheduled hours
  image_description: The plot displays a step line chart showing server response time
    monitoring over a 24-hour period. A dark blue step line (#306998) creates clear
    horizontal-then-vertical transitions characteristic of step functions. Yellow
    circular points (#FFD43B) with visible outlines mark each data point at every
    hour. The title "line-stepwise · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold. The X-axis is labeled "Hour of Day" ranging from 0 to 24 in increments of
    3, and the Y-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 50
    to 150. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines. The response
    time starts at 50ms and shows discrete jumps at hours 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21,
    eventually reaching peaks of 150ms before declining.
