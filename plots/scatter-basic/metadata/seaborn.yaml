review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with properly sized text elements following the
    library guidelines exactly
  - Realistic data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that demonstrates clear correlation
    with appropriate noise
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seaborn axes-level API usage
  - Good use of alpha transparency and white edge colors to handle point overlap
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive statistical features (e.g., regplot, jointplot,
    or hue parameter for additional dimension)
  - Marker size s=200 is at the upper end of the recommended range for 150 points
