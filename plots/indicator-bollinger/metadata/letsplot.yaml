review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen blue/yellow color scheme that clearly
    distinguishes price from bands
  - Proper implementation of Bollinger Bands with all three components (upper, lower,
    SMA) plus semi-transparent fill
  - Realistic synthetic data with volatility clustering that demonstrates band expansion/contraction
  - Clean KISS code structure following lets-plot grammar of graphics
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the three line types (Close Price, SMA, Upper/Lower
    Bands)
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (currently visible but acceptable)
  image_description: The plot displays a Bollinger Bands chart with a time series
    from January 22 to June 17, 2024. The price line (close) is rendered as a prominent
    yellow/gold line that moves within a blue-shaded volatility envelope. The upper
    and lower bands are shown as solid blue lines defining the envelope boundaries,
    with a semi-transparent light blue fill between them. The middle band (20-period
    SMA) is displayed as a dashed blue line. The chart shows price starting around
    $96, rising to ~$112 in early February, then declining through a high-volatility
    period (visible band widening around Feb-Mar), reaching lows near $76-78 in late
    March, followed by recovery with narrower bands. The title "indicator-bollinger
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at top center. X-axis shows "Date" with monthly
    tick marks, Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging from 76 to 114.
