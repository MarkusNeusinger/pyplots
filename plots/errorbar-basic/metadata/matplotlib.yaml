review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of asymmetric error bars demonstrating the feature mentioned
    in the spec
  - Clear experimental/clinical trial context with Control and Treatment groups
  - Proper error bar styling with visible caps (capsize=10) and appropriate line thickness
  - Perfect adherence to matplotlib style guide (Axes methods, proper font sizes,
    tight_layout)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Could showcase more matplotlib-specific features like error bar color gradients
    or connecting lines between points
  - Y-axis only grid is acceptable but full grid could enhance readability
