review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color palette with high contrast (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-safe
  - Clean layered grammar of graphics approach with geom_violin + geom_jitter
  - Realistic and well-thought-out data scenario with varying complexity levels and
    expertise
  - Proper use of position_dodge to align grouped elements
  - Text sizing follows guidelines perfectly for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears with duplicate Expertise entries (both fill and color scales create
    separate legend items)
  - Uses geom_jitter for swarm points rather than true swarm positioning - plotnine
    lacks native geom_beeswarm
  - The guides() call with guide_legend() does not effectively merge the legends
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped violin chart with swarm overlay
    showing response times (in milliseconds) across three task types (Simple, Moderate,
    Complex) and two expertise levels (Novice in steel blue, Expert in golden yellow).
    Each violin shape effectively shows the distribution of data, with individual
    data points rendered as jittered markers inside the violins. The Novice group
    consistently shows higher response times than Expert across all task complexity
    levels. Response times increase from Simple (~300-500ms) to Moderate (~400-900ms)
    to Complex (~600-1400ms). The violins have semi-transparent fills (alpha ~0.5)
    allowing the swarm points to remain visible. The title uses the correct format:
    ''violin-grouped-swarm · plotnine · pyplots.ai''. The legend is positioned on
    the right side, clearly labeling the two expertise levels with matching colors.'
