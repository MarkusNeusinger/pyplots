review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal dumbbell chart with proper before/after comparison visualization
  - Data sorted by improvement magnitude reveals patterns effectively
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with separate DataFrames for segments
    and points
  - Good use of categorical ordering to maintain sort order on y-axis
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Connecting lines appropriately thin and subtle as specified
  - Well-sized figure (16x9) with appropriate text sizes for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Missing np.random.seed(42) for reproducibility (even though data is deterministic,
    it is a code standard)
  - Horizontal grid lines removed but vertical grid lines kept - for a horizontal
    dumbbell chart, horizontal grid lines would help read values more easily
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal dumbbell chart comparing employee
    satisfaction scores before and after workplace policy changes across 8 departments.
    Blue dots (#306998) represent "Before" scores and yellow dots (#FFD43B) represent
    "After" scores, connected by subtle gray lines. Departments are listed on the
    y-axis (HR, Customer Support, Engineering, Operations, Marketing, Product, Finance,
    Sales) and satisfaction scores (30-100) on the x-axis. The data is sorted by improvement
    magnitude with HR and Customer Support showing the largest gains at the bottom.
    The title correctly displays "dumbbell-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". A legend
    on the right distinguishes "After" and "Before" periods. Text is well-sized and
    readable, with a clean minimal theme and subtle vertical grid lines.

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot, aes, geom_segment, geom_point,

          or statistical transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
