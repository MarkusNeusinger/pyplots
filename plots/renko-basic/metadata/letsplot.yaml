review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Renko algorithm implementation with proper reversal logic (2-brick reversal
    requirement)
  - Clean, readable code with proper KISS structure
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good use of geom_rect for brick rendering with customized borders
  - Proper HTML export alongside PNG for lets-plot interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme uses red-green which is not ideal for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue/orange alternatives)
  - Legend could have slightly larger text or be positioned closer to plot area
  - Could leverage lets-plot tooltips for interactive hover information on bricks
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 60 bricks
    showing simulated stock price movements from ~$88 to ~$140. Green bricks represent
    bullish (upward) price movements and red bricks represent bearish (downward) movements.
    The bricks are uniform in size ($2 each) and clearly separated with small gaps.
    The X-axis shows "Brick Index" (0-60), the Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from
    90 to 140. A legend on the right side clearly identifies "Bullish" (green) and
    "Bearish" (red) directions. The chart uses a minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.
    The title follows the required format: "renko-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai".
    The overall trend shows an initial rise, a significant drop around brick 10-12,
    followed by a strong uptrend from brick 30 onwards.'
