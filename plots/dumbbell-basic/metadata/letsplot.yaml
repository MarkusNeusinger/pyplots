quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended by spec
  - Smart sorting by improvement magnitude reveals patterns effectively
  - 'Clean color scheme using Python colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that are
    colorblind-safe'
  - Proper use of geom_segment for connecting lines with subtle gray color
  - Good text sizing following letsplot guidelines (title 24, axis titles 20, text
    16)
  - Y-axis grid disabled to reduce visual clutter for horizontal chart
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned far from data; could be integrated closer using legend_position
  - All data shows positive improvements only; including some negative or zero changes
    would demonstrate the plot type's full capability
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal dumbbell chart showing employee
    satisfaction scores across 10 departments. Each department is represented on the
    y-axis, with satisfaction scores on the x-axis ranging from 50 to 95. Yellow dots
    represent "Before" scores and dark blue dots represent "After" scores, connected
    by thin gray lines. The chart is sorted by improvement magnitude (largest improvement
    at top - Customer Support, smallest at bottom - Operations). The title "Employee
    Satisfaction · dumbbell-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    A legend on the right identifies the Period (Before/After). The grid is subtle
    with light gray lines, and the overall layout is clean and well-balanced.
