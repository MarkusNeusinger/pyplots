review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Kaplan-Meier step function implementation showing survival probability
    decay over time
  - Excellent colorblind-safe blue/yellow color palette with strong visual contrast
  - Realistic clinical trial context comparing Standard vs Experimental treatment
    groups
  - Clean axis labels with proper units (Time in Months, Survival Probability)
  - Code structure improved to inline calculations (no function definitions)
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval bands are coded but not visually rendering in the output image
  - Censored observation markers are coded but not appearing on the plot
  - Legend shows only 2 of the 8 added series - pygal may be limiting legend entries
  - Legend placement is minimal in top-left corner rather than at bottom as configured
