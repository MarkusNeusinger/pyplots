review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation showing all 4 required curves with distinct visual styles
    (solid/dashed lines)
  - Optimal point clearly marked with large dot and descriptive label
  - Formula embedded in Y-axis label per spec requirement
  - Zone indicators provide visual separation between underfitting/overfitting regions
  - Good use of pygal XY chart type with custom styling
  - Legend labels include helpful directional arrows (decreasing, increasing)
  weaknesses:
  - Shaded regions requested in spec are implemented as thin line indicators rather
    than actual shaded areas
  - Spec requests annotations to label each curve directly on the plot but implementation
    uses legend instead
  - Legend at bottom with 7 items is somewhat crowded and text is relatively small
  image_description: 'The plot displays the bias-variance tradeoff visualization with
    4 distinct curves on a white background. The title "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" is at the top. The X-axis is labeled "Model Complexity (Low
    → High)" ranging from 0 to 11, and the Y-axis is labeled "Prediction Error | Total
    = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible" ranging from 0 to 4. The curves shown are: (1)
    Bias² in red dashed line - decreasing from ~3.4 to ~0.4 as complexity increases,
    (2) Variance in green dashed line - increasing from near 0 to ~3.2, (3) Total
    Error in purple solid line - showing characteristic U-shape with minimum around
    x=3.1, (4) Irreducible Error in teal/cyan dashed line - constant at 0.5. A dark
    red dot marks the optimal point at approximately (3.1, 2.2). Two zone indicators
    appear at the bottom: blue line for "Underfitting Zone" on the left and orange
    line for "Overfitting Zone" on the right. A legend at the bottom shows all 7 series
    with clear labels.'
