review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 180-degree rotational symmetry for black cell placement
  - Clean, professional appearance matching newspaper crossword standards
  - Proper number placement algorithm identifying cells that start across/down words
  - Good use of Plotly shapes API for grid construction
  - Square aspect ratio correctly enforced with scaleanchor
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Clue numbers could be slightly larger for better visibility at a glance
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with a traditional
    newspaper-style layout. White cells for letter entry are clearly distinguished
    from solid black blocking cells. The grid uses a blue color scheme (#306998) for
    cell borders and clue numbers. Numbers 1-78 are positioned in the top-left corner
    of cells that start across or down words. The black cells follow 180-degree rotational
    symmetry as expected for traditional crosswords. The title "crossword-basic ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue text. The grid is square with
    equal-sized cells, rendered on a clean white background with balanced margins.
