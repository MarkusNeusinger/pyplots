review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of stepped interpolation (step-after) which correctly represents
    threshold-based PR curves
  - Clean comparison of two classifiers with clearly distinguishable colors (colorblind-safe)
  - Proper inclusion of random classifier baseline with dashed styling
  - Average Precision (AP) scores embedded directly in legend labels for easy reference
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate font sizes and symbol styling
  - Proper use of Altair layering for combining PR curves with baseline
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., "Recall (Sensitivity)" and "Precision
    (PPV)") to aid interpretation
  image_description: The plot displays a precision-recall curve comparing two classifiers
    on a 16:9 canvas. A blue stepped line represents "Logistic Regression (AP = 0.634)"
    and a yellow/gold stepped line represents "Random Forest (AP = 0.752)". A gray
    dashed horizontal baseline at precision = 0.30 indicates the random classifier
    performance. The X-axis is labeled "Recall" (0.00 to 1.00) and the Y-axis is labeled
    "Precision" (0.00 to 1.00). The title "precision-recall · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The legend is well-positioned in the bottom-right corner,
    showing all three line types with their respective colors and AP scores.
