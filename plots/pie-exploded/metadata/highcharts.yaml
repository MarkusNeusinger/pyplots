    effect
  - Clean, professional visualization with appropriate font sizes for 3600x3600 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between segments
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic market share scenario that demonstrates the purpose of exploded pie
    charts
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Inline Highcharts JS loading for reliable headless Chrome rendering
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor layout imbalance: pie appears slightly left-heavy due to vertical legend
    on right side'
  - Data variation could be more dramatic to better showcase the explosion feature
    contrast
