review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine composition operators (| and /) to create mosaic-like
    layout
  - Clean, consistent color scheme using blue/yellow palette throughout all panels
  - Good visual hierarchy with larger overview panel and smaller detail panels
  - Well-structured code with clear separation of data generation and plotting
  - Appropriate use of diverse geoms (geom_line, geom_point, geom_bar, geom_tile,
    geom_text)
  - Professional theming with customized text sizes for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Heatmap colorbar legend is placed at the very bottom of the figure, visually separated
    from its panel
  - Title uses suptitle which works but could be more integrated with plotnine native
    theme system
  - Could demonstrate the mosaic empty cell feature mentioned in the spec using placeholder
    characters
  image_description: 'The plot displays a well-organized mosaic dashboard layout with
    5 distinct panels. The top row features a large line+point chart (left ~2/3 width)
    showing sales trends over 60 days for three products (Alpha in dark blue, Beta
    in yellow, Gamma in light blue), alongside a smaller bar chart (right ~1/3) showing
    quarterly revenue with Q4 highlighted in yellow. The bottom row contains three
    equally-sized panels: a scatter plot of Units Sold vs Margin (%), a heatmap showing
    regional performance across Sales/Profit/Growth metrics with numeric values displayed
    in each cell, and a bar chart of monthly scores (Jan-Jun). The main title "subplot-mosaic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in bold. Colors are consistent
    throughout with a blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) theme.'

        comment: Effectively uses plotnine's composition operators (| for horizontal,
          / for vertical layout), ggplot grammar with multiple geoms, custom theming
  verdict: APPROVED
