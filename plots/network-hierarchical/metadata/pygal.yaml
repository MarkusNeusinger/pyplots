review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using pygal XY chart to simulate hierarchical network graph
  - Clean color scheme with distinct colors for each hierarchy level (blue, yellow,
    teal, coral)
  - Well-structured code with clear data organization and layout calculations
  - Proper use of discontinuous lines (None separators) for edge rendering
  - Good legend placement and organization with 5 columns
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (CEO, VP Eng, etc.) are not visible in the static PNG output - the
    print_values and formatter configuration does not render labels on the nodes
  - Significant empty whitespace below the tree (y=0 to ~30) could be better utilized
  - 'Edges are somewhat faint (grey #666666) and could be more prominent'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart with 22
    nodes arranged across 4 distinct levels. At the top (level ~83) is a single dark
    blue node representing the CEO. Below (~65) are 3 yellow/gold nodes representing
    VPs. The third level (~48) contains 7 teal/turquoise nodes for Directors. The
    bottom level (~31) has 11 coral/salmon colored nodes for Managers. Grey lines
    connect parent nodes to their children, clearly showing the tree structure. The
    background is white with a clean layout. The title "network-hierarchical · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom identifies: Edges, CEO,
    VPs, Directors, Managers. Axis labels show "Organization Width" (x-axis) and "Hierarchy
    Level (Top to Bottom)" (y-axis). Node labels (like "CEO", "VP Eng", etc.) are
    NOT visible in the static PNG output despite being configured with print_values=True.'
