review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of file system data that clearly demonstrates hierarchical relationships
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for major directories (blue, cyan,
    yellow, purple)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with inline Highcharts JS for headless
    Chrome
  - Title format correctly follows the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of data labels with text outlines for visibility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Not a true icicle chart: The treemap with stripes layout does not produce the
    layered rectangle structure described in the spec - an icicle chart should show
    rectangles stacked top-to-bottom with explicit parent-child adjacency at each
    level'
  - Root node Project Files is not visible in the visualization
  - No legend explaining what the colors represent (src, docs, tests, assets)
  - Some data labels are truncated or overlap in narrow stripes
  - Hierarchy levels are not visually distinct - should show clear rows/columns for
    each depth level
