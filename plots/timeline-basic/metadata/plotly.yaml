review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alternating label positions above/below the axis to
    prevent text overlap
  - Clean use of Plotly annotation system for event labels and date labels
  - Interactive hover templates showing formatted dates enhance usability
  - Color scheme effectively distinguishes the four project phases
  - Proper use of go.Scatter for both the timeline axis and event markers
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow markers (#FFD43B) have lower contrast against white background
  - Vertical grid lines could be more subtle or removed for cleaner appearance
  - Could leverage Plotly interactivity more (e.g., range slider for zooming dense
    timelines)
