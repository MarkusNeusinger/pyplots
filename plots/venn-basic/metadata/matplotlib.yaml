  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of square figure format (12x12) which is ideal for circular Venn
    diagrams
  - Clear and intuitive color scheme with Python blue (#306998), JavaScript yellow
    (#FFD43B), and SQL cyan (#4ECDC4)
  - Well-organized code with clear variable names explaining each region
  - Appropriate alpha transparency (0.6) that shows overlaps clearly
  - Good use of matplotlib_venn library venn3 function with proper 7-tuple subset
    format
  - Realistic and relatable data context (developer survey about programming languages)
  weaknesses:
  - Figure size uses 12x12 instead of the standard 3600x3600 or 4800x2700 canvas dimensions
  - Could add a brief subtitle or annotation explaining the data context
  - The yellow JavaScript circle could benefit from a slightly darker shade for better
    contrast against white background
  image_description: 'The plot shows a classic three-circle Venn diagram with overlapping
    circles representing Python (blue, #306998), JavaScript (yellow, #FFD43B), and
    SQL (cyan, #4ECDC4). The title "venn-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top in bold black text. Each set is labeled with bold text (Python top-left,
    JavaScript top-right, SQL bottom-center). Each region displays its count in bold:
    Python-only (40), JavaScript-only (25), SQL-only (15), Python+JavaScript overlap
    (20), Python+SQL overlap (10), JavaScript+SQL overlap (15), and the central triple
    overlap (10). The circles have 0.6 alpha transparency, creating distinct blended
    colors in overlapping regions. The plot uses a square 12x12 figure with a white
    background.'
