review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with clear section comments
  - Excellent color palette with good contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Proper use of pygal Style class for comprehensive customization
  - Percentage labels are well-positioned and clearly readable inside slices
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears relatively small compared to the pie chart; could increase
    legend_font_size for better readability
  - Missing slight explosion for emphasis on key slice as suggested in the specification
