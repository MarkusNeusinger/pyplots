review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adaptation of animated concept to static faceted view, following spec
    guidance for libraries without animation
  - Clean Gapminder-inspired data with realistic development metrics across multiple
    decades
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (Q, N, O)
  - Effective use of size encoding for population and color for regions
  - Proper scale domains ensure consistent axes across all facets for easy comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Year labels at top of facets could be slightly larger for emphasis
  - Legend placement creates slight right-margin crowding; could benefit from more
    padding
  - Missing interactive() call for HTML output which would enable zoom/pan exploration
