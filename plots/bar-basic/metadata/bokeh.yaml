review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for high-resolution output (36pt title, 28pt labels, 24pt
    ticks)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Value labels using LabelSet add precision reading capability
  - Clean grid styling with dashed lines and low alpha
  - Correct y-axis starting at 0
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Bokeh interactivity strength
  weaknesses:
  - Data values are monotonically decreasing which does not showcase varied comparisons
    typical in real bar charts
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product sales
    by category. Six blue bars (#306998) represent Electronics ($42,500), Clothing
    ($31,200), Home & Garden ($28,700), Sports ($19,800), Books ($15,400), and Toys
    ($12,600). Value labels appear above each bar. The title "bar-basic · bokeh ·
    pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" and
    the y-axis "Sales ($)". A subtle dashed horizontal grid aids value reading. The
    y-axis correctly starts at 0. Bars have consistent widths with adequate spacing
    between them.
