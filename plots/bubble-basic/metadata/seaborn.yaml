review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario (GDP vs life expectancy) that naturally demonstrates the
    bubble chart three-variable storytelling capability
  - 'Strong visual refinement: asymmetric grid, removed spines, white edge colors
    on bubbles, refined legend frame'
  - Idiomatic seaborn usage with axes-level API, leveraging size/hue mapping and sns.move_legend
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS pattern with appropriate complexity
  - Color progression semantically tied to economic tiers creates natural visual narrative
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette includes a red-green pair that could be challenging for colorblind
    users; consider using a fully colorblind-safe palette
  - Some of the largest bubbles (sizes up to 2200) dominate visually; the max size
    could be reduced slightly for better balance
  - Alpha at 0.65 is marginally low for 40 data points; 0.70-0.75 would improve visibility
    while still handling overlap
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bubble chart with 40 data points representing
    world cities. The x-axis shows "GDP per Capita ($ thousands)" ranging from ~5
    to ~90, and the y-axis shows "Life Expectancy (years)" ranging from ~58 to ~82.
    Bubble sizes vary based on population in millions, with the smallest bubbles representing
    ~1M and the largest ~30M. Four economic tiers are color-coded: Emerging (coral/salmon),
    Developing (orange), Advanced (green), and Elite (blue). The data shows a clear
    positive correlation — cities with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life
    expectancy. The color progression flows naturally from lower-left (Emerging, red
    tones) to upper-right (Elite, blue tones). Top and right spines are removed, with
    subtle asymmetric gridlines (y-axis slightly more prominent). The legend in the
    lower-right corner displays both the economic tier color key and a population
    size reference with graduated circles. The title reads "bubble-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. White edge colors on bubbles provide clean
    separation where they overlap. The overall layout is well-balanced with the plot
    filling the canvas effectively.'
