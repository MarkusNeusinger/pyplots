review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed circle packing simulation with proper area-based scaling
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for efficient data binding
  - Clean implementation of hover tooltips with formatted budget values
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  - Smart label placement only on larger circles to avoid clutter
  weaknesses:
  - White text on yellow circles has lower contrast than on blue circles
  - Color palette repeats without logical grouping meaning
  - No legend or color key explaining what colors represent
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart with 15 circles representing
    department budgets. Circle sizes scale by budget amount (from $6M Security to
    $45M Engineering). Colors alternate between Python blue tones (#306998, #4B8BBE,
    #3776AB) and yellow tones (#FFD43B, #FFE873). Larger circles display labels with
    department names and budget values in white text (e.g., ''Engineering $45M'',
    ''R&D $42M''). The title ''Department Budgets · bubble-packed · bokeh · pyplots.ai''
    appears at the top. Circles are tightly packed without overlap on a light gray
    background (#f8f9fa), with white outlines separating them. Axes are hidden as
    appropriate for this chart type.'
