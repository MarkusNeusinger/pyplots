review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered composition to combine donut segments, percentage
    labels, and center text
  - Clean declarative syntax with proper encoding types (theta, color, text)
  - Interactive tooltips enhance user experience in HTML output
  - White stroke between segments improves visual separation
  - Center text effectively displays total budget metric as specified
  - Well-proportioned ring width for readability
  weaknesses:
  - The two blue colors (Marketing and Operations) are somewhat similar and could
    be more distinct
  - Percentage labels on very small segments may be harder to read at smaller display
    sizes
