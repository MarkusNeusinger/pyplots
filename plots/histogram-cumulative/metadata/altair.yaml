quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing throughout
  - Correct implementation of cumulative histogram using step-after interpolation
  - Realistic data scenario (electricity usage) that demonstrates bimodal distribution
  - Well-formatted tooltips showing usage, cumulative percentage, and count
  - Proper use of Altair declarative syntax with appropriate encoding types
  - Interactive HTML export included alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Could add reference lines (e.g., median at 50% mark) to enhance readability
  - Missing explicit legend even though single series (minor)
  - Library features score lower due to not using Altair interactive selection capabilities
