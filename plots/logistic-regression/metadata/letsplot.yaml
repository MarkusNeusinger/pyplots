review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sigmoid curve representation with proper confidence interval visualization
  - Clean, minimal theme with good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics
  - Realistic study hours vs exam outcome scenario that clearly demonstrates logistic
    regression
  - Proper jittering of binary outcome points for visibility
  - Correct title format and proper 16:9 aspect ratio output
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses custom functions (sigmoid, fit_logistic) violating KISS principle -
    consider using sklearn or statsmodels
  - Red-yellow color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue-orange)
  - Missing model coefficient or accuracy annotation as suggested in spec notes
  - Axis labels lack units (could use Study Hours (hours) though units are implicit)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression visualization showing
    the relationship between Study Hours (x-axis, ranging from -0.5 to 10.5) and Probability
    (y-axis, ranging from 0 to 1). The characteristic S-shaped sigmoid curve is rendered
    as a solid blue line (~2.5px width) with the Python blue color (#306998). A semi-transparent
    light blue confidence interval band surrounds the curve. Data points are shown
    as circles with two colors: red/coral (#DC2626) for "Fail" outcomes (class 0)
    and yellow (#FFD43B) for "Pass" outcomes (class 1). Points are jittered around
    their binary y-values (0 and 1) for visibility. A horizontal dashed gray line
    at y=0.5 indicates the decision threshold. The legend is positioned on the right
    side labeled "Outcome" with Fail and Pass entries. The title correctly shows "logistic-regression
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The minimal theme provides a clean appearance with subtle
    gridlines.'
