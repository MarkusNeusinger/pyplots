review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE-based density contours using a custom marching
    squares algorithm
  - Outstanding colorblind-safe viridis-inspired color palette for density gradient
    visualization
  - Effective combination of scatter overlay with contour lines for context
  - Well-designed legend with density scale representation
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations for inline contour level labels
  - Clean data generation showing three distinct clusters of varying densities
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently using Dot style which is adequate but
    slightly prominent)
  - Scatter points are somewhat small relative to the contour line thickness
