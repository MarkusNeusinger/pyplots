review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with music streaming trends showing seasonal
    variation
  - Good use of cubic interpolation for smooth, flowing curves
  - Well-configured custom style with appropriate font sizes for the canvas
  - Clean color palette with good contrast between adjacent areas
  - Proper use of major x-axis labels to prevent crowding
  weaknesses:
  - 'Not a true streamgraph: uses standard stacked area (baseline at zero) instead
    of centered/symmetric baseline as required by spec'
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text before the required spec-id format
  - Adjacent yellow and coral colors may pose accessibility issues for color vision
    deficiency
