review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent decision boundary visualization with clear separation between blue and
    yellow regions
  - Good use of different marker shapes (circles for Class 0, diamonds for Class 1)
    to distinguish classes
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette using blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
  - 'Title follows correct format: contour-decision-boundary · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Clean heatmap implementation showing probability gradients through the decision
    space
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label (Feature X1) is missing - only Y-axis label (Feature X2) is visible
  - Color axis legend on right side shows truncated values (1.0 and 0.0 partially
    visible)
  - Legend box with Training Data title and class names is not visible in the rendered
    image
  image_description: 'The plot shows a decision boundary visualization for a KNN classifier
    on moon-shaped data. The background is a heatmap with blue (#306998) regions on
    the left side (Class 0 prediction probability) transitioning through a light gray/white
    gradient in the middle to yellow (#FFD43B) regions on the right side (Class 1
    prediction probability). Training data points are overlaid as scatter markers:
    blue circles for Class 0 and yellow diamonds for Class 1. The title "contour-decision-boundary
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "KNN Classifier
    Decision Boundary on Moon-shaped Data" below it. The Y-axis is labeled "Feature
    X2" with tick values from -1.5 to 2.5. The X-axis shows tick values from -1.5
    to 2.5. A small color axis legend appears on the right showing the 0.0 to 1.0
    probability scale. The overall layout fills the canvas well with balanced margins.'
