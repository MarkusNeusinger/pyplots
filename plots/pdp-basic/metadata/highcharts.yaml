review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of PDP with confidence intervals computed from individual
    conditional expectations
  - Includes rug plot using plotLines to show training data distribution
  - Centers partial dependence at zero for easier interpretation as recommended in
    spec
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme using Python Blue (#306998)
  - Proper use of AreaRangeSeries for the confidence band
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned in top-right corner with significant empty space between
    it and the data area
  - Rug plot lines could be slightly thicker or more prominent at the bottom of the
    plot rather than spanning full height
  - Could add more descriptive tooltip content showing exact values
  image_description: The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot with a blue line
    (#306998) showing the relationship between Feature 0 Value (x-axis, ranging from
    approximately -1.5 to 1.5) and Partial Dependence centered (y-axis, ranging from
    approximately -14 to 17). A light blue shaded area represents the 90% Confidence
    Interval around the main PDP line. Vertical blue lines along the x-axis serve
    as a rug plot showing the distribution of training data values. The title "pdp-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is at the top with a subtitle "Partial Dependence of
    Feature 0 on Model Predictions". A dashed horizontal line at y=0 provides a reference.
    The legend is positioned in the top-right corner. The overall layout is clean
    with subtle grid lines.
