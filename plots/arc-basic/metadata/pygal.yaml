  image_description: The plot displays an arc diagram with 10 character names (Alice,
    Bob, Carol, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Iris, Jack) arranged horizontally
    along the bottom on a white background. Each character is represented by a yellow/gold
    circular node (#FFD43B). The connections between characters are shown as blue
    curved arcs (#306998) above the horizontal baseline. The arcs vary in height proportional
    to the distance between connected nodes - longer-range connections (like Alice-Jack)
    have higher arcs, while shorter-range connections (like Bob-Carol) have lower
    arcs. Arc thickness varies based on connection weight, with stronger connections
    appearing thicker. The title "Character Interactions · arc-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in blue. The arcs have semi-transparency allowing overlapping
    arcs to be distinguishable.
  verdict: APPROVED
