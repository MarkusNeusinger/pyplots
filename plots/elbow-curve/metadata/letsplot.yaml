review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly scaled text elements for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clear elbow point highlighting using contrasting yellow diamond marker and vertical
    dashed line
  - Proper implementation of lets-plot grammar of graphics with layered geoms
  - Clean KISS code structure following project guidelines
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - No legend or annotation text explaining what the yellow marker/line represents
    (the optimal k value)
  - Could use lets-plot interactive features like tooltips showing exact values on
    hover
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha currently at 0.5, could be 0.3)
