review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable visualization with proper text sizing
  - Correct implementation of route path with color gradient showing progress
  - Distinct start (green circle) and end (red square) markers as specified
  - Realistic hiking trail data in Swiss Alps context
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - No geographic basemap for spatial context (spec requirement)
  - Axis labels missing unit notation (degree symbols)
  - No subtle grid lines to help read coordinates
  - No legend explaining start/end marker meanings
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features more
  image_description: The plot displays a hiking route path visualized on a coordinate
    plane with Longitude (9.805-9.91) on the x-axis and Latitude (46.845-46.895) on
    the y-axis. The path forms an elongated loop pattern, starting from a green circle
    marker at approximately (9.85, 46.85), winding northward and eastward to about
    (9.905, 46.895), then returning back south to end at a red square marker near
    (9.885, 46.847). The path is color-coded using a gradient from dark blue (0% progress)
    through gray/olive tones (40-60%) to yellow (100%), showing the journey progression.
    A color legend labeled "Progress (%)" is displayed on the right side with values
    from 0 to 100. The title "map-route-path · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is bold and
    positioned at the top. The minimal theme provides a clean white background with
    no grid lines. Start and end markers are clearly distinguished with green circle
    (start) and red square (end) as specified.
