review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario using NYC taxi pickups with realistic geographic
    clustering
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data generation
  - Good use of YlOrRd sequential colormap which is colorblind-accessible
  - Appropriate hexagon sizing (gridsize=35) for the data density
  - Well-formatted title following spec requirements
  - Geographic annotations (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Financial District) provide helpful
    context
  weaknesses:
  - Missing base map overlay (coastlines, boundaries, or street map) as required by
    specification - only has reference lines and annotations
  - Uses matplotlib hexbin function rather than seaborn-specific plotting; seaborn
    is only used for theme styling
  - Axis labels lack units (should be Longitude and Latitude with degree symbols)
  - Canvas utilization could be better - equal aspect ratio leaves whitespace
  - Tick label fontsize (14pt) is slightly below recommended 16pt
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning map of NYC taxi pickup
    locations. The visualization uses a YlOrRd (Yellow-Orange-Red) sequential colormap
    where light yellow indicates low pickup counts (~10-20) and dark red indicates
    high counts (~140-150). The hexagons are overlaid on a light gray background (#f5f5f5)
    with subtle grid lines and two dashed reference lines at latitude 40.75 and longitude
    -74.0. Three geographic region annotations are visible: "Manhattan" (upper right
    area), "Financial District" (left-center), and "Brooklyn" (lower center). The
    X-axis shows Longitude ranging from approximately -74.2 to -73.7, and the Y-axis
    shows Latitude from about 40.55 to 40.90. A vertical colorbar on the right displays
    "Pickup Count" with values from ~10 to ~150. The title follows the required format:
    "NYC Taxi Pickups · hexbin-map-geographic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The hexagons
    show clear clustering with highest density in the Manhattan area (around lat 40.78,
    lon -73.97) and the Financial District (around lat 40.70, lon -74.01), with a
    secondary cluster for Brooklyn (around lat 40.65-40.68).'
