review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correct implementation of cumulative histogram using bar chart with computed cumulative
    proportions
  - Good use of 45-degree label rotation to prevent overlap
  - Realistic test score scenario with properly clipped values (0-100)
  - Both HTML and PNG outputs generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity) for better visual hierarchy
  - Could use pygal native Histogram() chart type instead of manual computation with
    Bar()
  - Missing tooltips configuration to enhance interactivity in HTML output
