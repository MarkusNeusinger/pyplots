review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud on top, boxplot centered, and rain points
    below
  - Excellent bimodal distribution in Treatment B demonstrating the power of raincloud
    plots over simple boxplots
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Professional appearance with well-sized text elements
  - Creative plotnine solution using geom_ribbon for half-violins
  weaknesses:
  - No legend showing color-to-condition mapping (relies solely on y-axis labels)
  - Uses scipy for KDE instead of native plotnine density geoms (geom_violin with
    half-violin trimming would be more idiomatic)
