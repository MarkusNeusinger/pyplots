review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper text sizing and no overlap
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny with realistic branch lengths
  - Good use of Altair layered composition for complex tree structure
  - Proper scale bar with units for interpreting evolutionary distances
  - Interactive tooltips enhance exploration of the tree
  - Colorblind-safe Python Blue/Yellow color scheme
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of preferred flat KISS structure
  - Missing clade color-coding which was mentioned in specification notes
  - Internal nodes could be slightly larger for better visibility
