review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native bullet chart module with proper targetOptions
    configuration
  - Grayscale qualitative ranges follow spec recommendation for keeping focus on primary
    measure
  - Data labels display original values with units inside bars for precise reading
  - Multiple bullet charts stacked vertically for easy metric comparison
  - Good normalization approach allows comparing different-scale metrics on common
    0-100% axis
  - Clean separation of data definition and chart options
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend scoring limited since bullet charts do not typically use these elements
  - Vertical spacing between metrics could be tighter for more compact dashboard view
  - Y-axis title slightly small relative to 4800x2700 canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bullet chart with 4 KPI metrics
    stacked vertically: Revenue ($K), Profit (%), New Customers, and Satisfaction
    (/5). Each metric shows a blue bar (Python blue #306998) representing the actual
    value, with a thin vertical black target marker line. The background uses three
    grayscale bands (light gray ~#e0e0e0, medium gray ~#b0b0b0, dark gray ~#808080)
    representing poor/satisfactory/good qualitative ranges. Data labels in white text
    display actual values inside the bars (275$K, 22%, 1650, 4.5/5). The title "bullet-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle "Q4 Performance
    Dashboard - Actual vs Target". The x-axis shows percentage scale (0-100%) with
    "% of Target Range" label. Category labels are positioned on the left side.'
