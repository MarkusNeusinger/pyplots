review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the horizon chart concept with proper band folding
    and color intensity encoding
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic server metrics scenario that perfectly matches the spec dashboard monitoring
    use case
  - Good use of matplotlib fill_between with alpha transparency for layered bands
  - Series labels positioned cleanly on the right side without cluttering the visualization
  - Legend clearly explains the 6-band color scheme
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes slightly below optimal (22pt title vs recommended 24pt, 14pt labels
    vs 16-20pt)
  - Series could show more dramatic variation to better demonstrate the horizon chart
    ability to highlight differences
  - Missing descriptive subtitle explaining what horizon charts do
  image_description: The plot displays a horizon chart showing 8 server metrics (CPU
    Load, Memory, Network I/O, Disk I/O, Requests/s, Latency, Queue Depth, Threads)
    as horizontally stacked panels over 24 hours. Each panel uses blue shades (Python
    Blue) for positive deviations and red/pink shades for negative deviations, with
    3 overlapping bands of increasing color intensity (Low/Mid/High). The title "horizon-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is at the top, with a 6-item legend below it. Series
    names appear as bold labels on the right side of each row. The x-axis shows datetime
    ticks (01-15 00 through 01-15 21) with "Time (Hour of Day)" label. The design
    is clean with no y-axis ticks and minimal spines.

        comment: Uses subplots with shared x-axis, fill_between with alpha blending,
          text annotations; could leverage more advanced matplotlib features like
          transforms or custom colormaps
  verdict: APPROVED
