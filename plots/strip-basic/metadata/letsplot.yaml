review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with geom_jitter for strip plot
  - Realistic survey score data with distinct distributions per department showing
    the plot type strengths
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate grid styling (horizontal only)
  - Proper reproducibility with fixed seeds in both numpy and geom_jitter
  - Well-calibrated jitter width (0.25) and alpha (0.6) per spec recommendations
  weaknesses:
  - 'No legend present (minor: single-color plot does not strictly require one)'
  - Point size could be slightly larger for better visibility at full 4800x2700 resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic strip plot showing survey scores (40-100
    points) across four departments: Marketing, Engineering, Sales, and Support. Points
    are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998) with horizontal jitter (width ~0.25)
    and alpha transparency (0.6) to reduce overplotting. The title "strip-basic ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot uses a clean minimal theme
    with subtle horizontal gray grid lines and no vertical grid lines. Each department
    shows distinct distribution patterns: Engineering clusters higher (80-90), Sales
    shows wide spread with outliers near 40, Marketing has moderate spread around
    70-80, and Support ranges from 50-95.'
