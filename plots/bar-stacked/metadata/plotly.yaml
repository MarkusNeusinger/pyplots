review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of annotations for total values above each stack
  - Clean data labels inside each bar segment with appropriate text colors (white
    on dark, dark on light)
  - Well-chosen color palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Proper use of Plotly stacking mode and bar gap for visual clarity
  - HTML export included for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend horizontal positioning at top takes vertical space; could use right-side
    vertical legend
  - Yellow and coral colors may be slightly challenging for some colorblind users
