review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including upper triangle masking,
    diverging colormap centered at zero, and correlation annotations
  - Adaptive text coloring (white on dark, black on light backgrounds) ensures excellent
    readability
  - Realistic economic indicator data with believable correlation patterns (Okun's
    Law reflected in GDP-Unemployment)
  - Clean square layout perfectly suited for symmetric matrix visualization
  - Proper colorbar with full -1 to 1 range for consistent interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels say Economic Indicators on both axes which is redundant - could be
    more informative or omitted on one axis
  - Font size of 14pt for cell annotations is adequate but could be slightly larger
    (16pt) for better readability at this image size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a lower-triangular correlation matrix heatmap
    showing relationships between 8 economic indicators: GDP Growth, Inflation, Unemployment,
    Interest Rate, Stock Index, Consumer Conf., Industrial Prod., and Trade Balance.
    The colormap is RdBu_r (red-blue diverging) with red indicating positive correlations
    and blue indicating negative correlations. The colorbar on the right ranges from
    -1.00 to 1.00. Each cell is annotated with correlation coefficients to 2 decimal
    places (e.g., -0.89, 0.72, 0.81). The diagonal shows 1.00 (perfect self-correlation).
    Text colors adapt based on background intensity - white text on dark cells, black
    text on light cells. The title reads "heatmap-correlation · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    in bold at the top. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees for readability. The
    layout is square (12x12) with clean margins.'

          more.
