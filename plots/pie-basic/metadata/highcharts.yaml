review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts-specific pie chart features including slice explosion
    and data label connectors
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between all 5 slices
  - Clean implementation following library best practices with proper container specification
  - 'All spec requirements met: percentage labels, legend, distinct colors, exploded
    slice emphasis'
  - Appropriate square format (3600x3600) chosen for pie chart visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Pie chart positioned at 40% horizontal center creates slight layout imbalance
    with excess whitespace on right
  - Data labels could benefit from slightly larger connector line distance for smaller
    slices
