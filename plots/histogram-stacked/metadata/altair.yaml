review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent declarative encoding with proper use of Altair grammar (alt.X with bin,
    alt.Y with stack="zero", alt.Color with custom scale)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with good data generation
  - Proper font sizing throughout (title 28pt, axis titles 22pt, labels 18pt, legend
    16-18pt)
  - Good color palette choice (blue, yellow, orange) that avoids colorblind issues
  - White stroke between bar segments (strokeWidth=0.5) enhances visual separation
  - Appropriate use of scale_factor=3.0 for high-resolution output
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend styling could be more polished (title and label fonts could be slightly
    larger for better visual hierarchy)
  - Could add tooltips for interactive exploration showing exact counts per bin
  - The order parameter could be more intentionally designed to show a specific visual
    story (e.g., ordering by mean score)
