  strengths:
  - Idiomatic lets-plot usage with geom_pie, layer_labels, and spacer styling — distinctly
    lets-plot features
  - Realistic smartphone market share data with plausible proportions
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue
  - White spacers between slices add visual polish
  - Deterministic data with clean KISS code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Pie chart is too small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas — excessive whitespace
    above and below reduces visual impact
  - Title font size is 22pt, below the 24pt minimum for full legibility score
  - No data storytelling — no annotations highlighting the market leader or key insight,
    no callouts or narrative elements
  - The exploded slice choice (OPPO at 8.8%) is valid but could be more impactful
    if the largest individual company (Apple) were emphasized instead
  - No visual refinement beyond theme_void — could benefit from a subtitle, annotation,
    or other polish element
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "Global Smartphone Market
    Share · pie-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" centered on a white canvas. Five slices
    represent: Apple (dark blue, 23.1%), Samsung (yellow, 19.4%), Xiaomi (green, 13.7%),
    OPPO (orange/coral, 8.8%), and Others (grey, 35.0%). The OPPO slice is slightly
    exploded outward from the pie. Each slice has a percentage label positioned inside
    or near it. White spacers separate the slices. A horizontal legend at the bottom
    shows colored dots with company names. The pie is moderately sized relative to
    the 16:9 canvas, with significant whitespace above and below the chart.'
