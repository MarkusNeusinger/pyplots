review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of polar coordinates with clear trigonometric
    transformations
  - Well-designed visual hierarchy with clear hour labels and temperature scale
  - Realistic hourly temperature data that demonstrates the cyclical nature polar
    charts excel at showing
  - Clean code structure with comprehensive gridline and label generation
  - Proper use of square canvas (1200x1200 scaled 3x) appropriate for polar charts
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use lets-plot native coord_polar() function which would be the idiomatic
    approach for this library
  - Temperature scale labels positioned only along one spoke; could be more intuitive
    if integrated differently
