review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizon chart implementation with proper band-folding algorithm that
    correctly separates positive/negative values
  - 'Previous feedback fully addressed: legend is now visible, y-axis label is accurate'
  - Purple-orange diverging palette is colorblind-safe and visually appealing
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario perfectly demonstrates the use case for horizon
    charts
  - Clean faceted layout makes comparing 6 time series easy
  - Proper lets-plot grammar usage with theme customization
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Tick text sizes could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full
    resolution'
  - File handling with shutil adds complexity that other libraries do not require
    (lets-plot limitation)
