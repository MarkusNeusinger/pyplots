review:
  strengths:
  - Clean declarative syntax using Altair composition operators (& for vertical, |
    for horizontal concatenation)
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity
  - Consistent color scheme across all chart components
  - Well-configured font sizes via configure_axis and configure_title
  - Saves both PNG and HTML outputs as appropriate for Altair
  weaknesses:
  - Marginal histogram axes do not share scales with the main scatter plot - X-axis
    ranges differ visually
  - Should use Altair resolve_scale() to ensure shared axis domains between marginal
    and scatter plots
  - Does not leverage Altair distinctive features like selections, conditional encodings,
    or interactivity beyond tooltips
