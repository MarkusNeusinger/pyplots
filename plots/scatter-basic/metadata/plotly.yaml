review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with annotated outliers and correlation coefficient
    — the annotations add narrative value beyond raw data display
  - Strong color design with Python blue (#306998) and accent orange (#D4782F) creating
    a cohesive, professional palette with white marker edges
  - 'Good use of Plotly-distinctive features: interactive hover templates, HTML export,
    hoverlabel customization'
  - 'Clean visual refinement: subtle grid (0.08 opacity), plotly_white template, custom
    background, dtick spacing'
  - Realistic educational dataset with intentional outliers demonstrating the scatter
    plot outlier-detection purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size 15 is slightly too large for 120 data points, causing visual congestion
    in the dense lower-left region (1-2h study hours, 44-58% scores) — reducing to
    ~11-12 would improve readability
  - The High effort low score annotation arrow points between the two orange diamonds
    at (8.5, 52) and (9.2, 55) rather than clearly connecting to one; repositioning
    to annotate both distinctly or adjusting arrow target would be clearer
  - Annotation loop (lines 86-107) is more verbose than needed — the dict-building
    with append could be simplified
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot of "Study Hours (h)" (x-axis,
    range 0-11) vs "Exam Score (%)" (y-axis, range 35-105) for approximately 120 students.
    Blue circle markers (#306998) with white edges and approximately 65% opacity form
    the main data cloud, showing a clear positive correlation. A dashed blue trend
    line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right. Two orange diamond markers
    (#D4782F) highlight outliers: one at approximately (2.0, 78) annotated "Low effort,
    high score" with an arrow pointing to the diamond, and two at approximately (8.5,
    52) and (9.2, 55) with an annotation "High effort, low score" with an arrow. The
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0.79) is displayed near the upper-right portion
    of the trend line with a semi-transparent white background. The title "scatter-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark bold font (Arial Black).
    The background is off-white (#FAFBFC) with very subtle grid lines (barely visible
    at 0.08 opacity). The layout uses the plotly_white template with balanced margins.
    Overall the plot has a professional, clean aesthetic with intentional color choices
    and effective data storytelling through outlier annotations.'
