review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional-looking gauge design with proper semi-circular layout
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good visual hierarchy with prominent value display
  - Proper color zone implementation with smooth transitions
  - Well-positioned zone labels that are readable
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is only used for sns.set_theme() styling - no seaborn plotting functions
    are used, all visualization is done with matplotlib patches and annotations
  - Red-yellow-green color scheme is not colorblind-safe (consider using colorblind-friendly
    palette)
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - gauge could be larger
  - 'Legend accuracy: the yellow zone appears orange (#F39C12)'
