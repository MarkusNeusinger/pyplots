review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of OHLC bar chart with proper left/right tick marks for
    open/close prices
  - Clear visual distinction between up and down days using appropriate colors
  - Good use of matplotlib.dates for proper date axis formatting with week-based locators
  - Realistic synthetic data generation with price gaps and appropriate daily volatility
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principle
  - Proper use of custom legend with Line2D elements
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis grid is too faint (alpha=0.15) compared to y-axis grid (alpha=0.3), making
    it harder to align dates with bars
  - Line width of 2.0 could be slightly thicker (2.5-3.0) for better visibility at
    full resolution
  - Data could be more descriptive (e.g., naming a fictional stock symbol for context)
  image_description: The plot displays an OHLC bar chart showing 45 trading days of
    stock price data from June 3 to August 5, 2024. Each bar consists of a vertical
    line representing the high-low range with horizontal tick marks on the left for
    the open price and the right for the close price. Blue bars (#306998) indicate
    "Up" days (Close ≥ Open) and red bars (#D62728) indicate "Down" days (Close <
    Open). The price ranges from approximately $127 to $170 USD. The chart includes
    a legend in the upper left explaining the color coding, date labels on the x-axis
    are rotated at 45 degrees showing weekly intervals (Mondays), and a subtle y-axis
    grid (alpha=0.3) helps read price levels. The title follows the required format
    "ohlc-bar · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The overall trend shows a downward price
    movement over the period with an initial rally from $150 to ~$167 in mid-June,
    followed by a sustained decline to ~$130 by late July.
