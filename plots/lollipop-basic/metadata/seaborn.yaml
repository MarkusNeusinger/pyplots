review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and elements
  - Correct horizontal orientation choice given category label lengths
  - Beautiful color scheme with high contrast (blue/yellow)
  - Clean minimalist aesthetic with removed spines
  - Data sorted by value for easy comparison
  - Proper use of units in axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Could add subtle value annotations at the markers to enhance readability
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib for stems rather than seaborn-specific features
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal lollipop chart showing product
    sales by category. Blue horizontal stems (#306998) extend from the y-axis baseline
    (0) to yellow circular markers (#FFD43B with blue edge) at each data value. The
    chart shows 10 product categories sorted by sales value in ascending order from
    bottom (Health at ~$18,000) to top (Electronics at ~$85,000). The title correctly
    uses the format "lollipop-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axis labels are descriptive
    ("Sales ($)" and "Product Category"), with subtle dashed grid lines on the x-axis.
    Top and right spines are removed for a minimalist aesthetic.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot for markers but relies on matplotlib for stems
          (hlines); seaborn doesn't have a native lollipop chart function, so this
          hybrid approach is acceptable but not showcasing seaborn's unique strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
