review:
  strengths:
  - Clean plotnine grammar of graphics implementation using geom_density with appropriate
    bandwidth
  - Includes rug plot showing individual observations as specified in notes
  - Bimodal distribution demonstrates distribution characteristics well (skewness,
    modality)
  - Proper title format with spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
  - Good use of theme_minimal with appropriately sized text elements for 4800x2700
    output
  - Realistic test scores scenario with sensible value range (0-100)
  weaknesses:
  - Rug plot color (yellow) could have better contrast against the white background
    for accessibility
