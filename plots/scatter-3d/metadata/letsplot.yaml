review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of isometric 3D projection with proper depth sorting
    (painters algorithm)
  - Creative use of floor grid to enhance depth perception
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate 3D spatial relationships
  - Interactive tooltips showing altitude and depth values add value
  - Clean code structure with well-documented cluster generation
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size (28pt) is slightly below the recommended 32pt for optimal visibility
    at full resolution
