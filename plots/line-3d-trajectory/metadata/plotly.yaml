review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of Lorenz attractor as a real-world physics application demonstrating
    trajectory visualization
  - Effective use of Viridis color gradient to show time progression along the trajectory
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper utilization of Plotly interactive 3D features with both PNG and HTML outputs
  - Good camera angle that reveals the characteristic butterfly structure
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use units or acknowledge dimensionless nature)
  - Minor spacing issue on left margin could be optimized
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D Lorenz attractor trajectory rendered as
    a continuous line in three-dimensional space. The trajectory exhibits the characteristic
    double-lobed butterfly pattern of the Lorenz system, with two main orbits centered
    around two attracting regions. The line color progresses from dark purple (time=0)
    through blue and green to bright yellow (time=1) using the Viridis colormap, effectively
    showing temporal evolution. All three axes are labeled "X Position", "Y Position",
    and "Z Position" with clear tick marks. A vertical colorbar on the right side
    indicates "Time" with values from 0 to 1. The 3D scene has subtle gray grid lines
    and light gray background planes on each axis. The title "Lorenz Attractor · line-3d-trajectory
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
