review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between segments
  - Clear percentage labels within each segment making exact values readable
  - Professional title format and informative subtitle
  - Well-structured legend placement at bottom
  - Realistic market share scenario that clearly demonstrates the 100% stacking concept
  - Good use of Highcharts native percent stacking feature
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis has too many tick marks (every 2%) creating visual clutter; consider using
    10% or 20% intervals
  - Grid could be more subtle with wider spacing for cleaner appearance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked column chart showing market
    share distribution across 5 quarters (Q1 2024 through Q1 2025) for 5 companies.
    Each bar reaches 100% and is divided into colored segments: TechCorp (blue) at
    the top showing declining share from 35% to 26%, DataFlow (yellow) growing from
    25% to 32%, CloudPeak (purple) steadily increasing from 20% to 25%, NetBase (cyan)
    declining slightly from 12% to 10%, and Others (brown) stable at 7-8%. The title
    "bar-stacked-percent · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    "Market Share by Quarter". The y-axis shows percentage values from 0% to 100%,
    and the x-axis shows quarters. A horizontal legend at the bottom identifies all
    five companies. Each segment displays its percentage value as a white label.'
