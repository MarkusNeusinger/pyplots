review:
  strengths:
  - 'Comprehensive Campbell Diagram with all required elements: 5 mode curves, 3 engine
    order lines, and critical speed markers with detailed intersection info'
  - Excellent font sizing and styling explicitly configured for 4800x2700 resolution
    - all text is clearly legible
  - 'Effective visual hierarchy: thick solid lines for modes, dashed lines for engine
    orders, large red dots for critical speeds - viewer immediately understands the
    diagram'
  - Strong use of pygal-specific features including per-point label dicts, dual output
    (SVG+PNG), and cubic interpolation for smooth curves
  - Realistic engineering data with proper mode naming conventions and physically
    plausible frequency-speed relationships
  weaknesses:
  - The 2x EO dark blue dashed line (#0d47a1) is somewhat similar to the 1st Bending
    solid blue (#306998) - using a more contrasting color for EO lines would improve
    differentiation
  - Engine order lines could benefit from slightly thicker strokes or more prominent
    dash patterns to stand out more distinctly from the mode curves in the PNG rendering
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with the title "campbell-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The X-axis shows "Rotational Speed (RPM)" ranging
    from 0 to 6,000, and the Y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" from 0.0 to 130.0. Five
    natural frequency mode curves are rendered as thick solid lines: 1st Bending (blue,
    rising gently from ~25 Hz), 2nd Bending (teal, rising from ~49 Hz), 1st Torsional
    (purple, declining slightly from ~62 Hz), Axial (orange, declining from ~78 Hz),
    and 2nd Torsional (green, rising from ~92 Hz). Three engine order excitation lines
    are drawn as dashed diagonals from the origin: 1x EO (red dashed), 2x EO (dark
    blue dashed), and 3x EO (purple dashed). Large vivid red dots mark Critical Speed
    intersections where engine order lines cross natural frequency curves. A legend
    at the bottom in three columns identifies all nine series. The background is white
    with subtle gray grid lines. The overall layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
