review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent scientific context using protein structure data with realistic Angstrom
    units
  - Clear three-cluster visualization demonstrates spatial relationships effectively
  - Good use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - White edge color on markers helps distinguish overlapping points
  - Clean, well-commented code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar placement on left side creates slight visual asymmetry; consider right
    side or adjusting padding
  - Axis label font size at 18pt is slightly below the recommended 20pt for optimal
    legibility
  - Could benefit from subtle grid lines to help viewers judge positions in 3D space
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D scatter plot with points distributed in
    three-dimensional space representing protein structure data. The title "Protein
    Structure · scatter-3d · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Three axes
    are labeled "X Coordinate (Å)", "Y Coordinate (Å)", and "Z Coordinate (Å)" with
    tick marks showing values roughly from -2 to 12 on each axis. Points are colored
    using the viridis colormap (purple to green to yellow) based on their Z-coordinate
    (elevation), with a colorbar on the left labeled "Elevation (Å)" ranging from
    0 to approximately 11. The points show three distinct clusters at different locations
    in 3D space. Each point has a white edge and partial transparency (alpha=0.7).
    The viewing angle shows the plot from an elevated perspective (elev=25, azim=45).

        comment: Uses matplotlib's 3D projection capability with basic customization
          (view_init, pane styling), but doesn't leverage advanced features like surface
          plots, custom colormaps, or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
