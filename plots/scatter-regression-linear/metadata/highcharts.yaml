quality_score: 93
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper font scaling for 4800x2700 resolution
  - 'All spec requirements met: scatter points, regression line, 95% CI band, R² value,
    and regression equation displayed'
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette using blue for data points and yellow for
    regression line
  - Good use of alpha transparency on data points (0.7) for appropriate density visualization
  - Proper statistical calculations including regression coefficients and confidence
    intervals
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible advertising/sales data
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-right corner with some wasted space; could be integrated
    more tightly with the plot area
