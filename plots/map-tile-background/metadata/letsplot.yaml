review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to simulating a tile-style map background with layered rectangles
    and polygons
  - Good use of layer_tooltips for interactive hover information
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color scheme and marker styling
  - Deterministic data with realistic European tourism context
  - Proper use of theme_void for map-style visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use actual tile-based map backgrounds (OSM, Stamen, etc.) as specified
    - uses manual polygon shapes instead
  - Title format uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot without hyphen
  - No proper tile provider attribution as required by the specification
  - Does not leverage lets-plots geotools or livemap features for proper map visualization
  - The landmass polygons are crude approximations, not providing the street-level
    detail mentioned in the spec
  image_description: The plot displays a map of Europe showing tourism data for 20
    major cities. The background consists of a light gray grid (simulating map tiles)
    overlaid with tan/beige polygon shapes representing European landmasses including
    mainland Europe, Scandinavia, British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland), Italy,
    and the Balkans. City locations are marked with circular markers that have a blue
    (#306998) outline and yellow (#FFD43B) fill. The marker sizes are scaled according
    to visitor counts, with Paris and London having the largest markers (representing
    ~38K and ~32K visitors). A size legend on the right shows "Visitors (thousands)"
    with three reference circles for 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000. The title reads "European
    Tourism · map-tile-background · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top.
