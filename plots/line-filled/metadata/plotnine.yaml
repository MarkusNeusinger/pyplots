review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent layering of geom_area and geom_line to create the filled effect with
    visible line on top
  - Well-chosen alpha value (0.4) matches spec recommendation (0.3-0.5)
  - Clean, professional appearance with consistent Python blue color (#306998)
  - Good use of theme customization for text sizing and grid styling
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with appropriate seasonal variation
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis displays months as decimals (2.5, 5.0, 7.5) instead of integers (1, 2,
    3...12) which is confusing for monthly data
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Website Visitors (thousands) or use K
    formatting)
