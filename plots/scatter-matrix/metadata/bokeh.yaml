review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and factor_cmap for color mapping by species
  - Clean 4x4 grid layout with histograms on diagonal and scatter plots off-diagonal
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal) with good contrast
  - Proper axis labels with units on all edges
  - Correct title format placement in top-left cell
  - Well-sized text for the 3600x3600 canvas (20pt axis labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Dashed grid lines at appropriate alpha for subtlety
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only visible in top-left histogram cell; could be more prominent or placed
    outside the grid
  - Output includes both PNG and HTML; while HTML is appropriate for Bokeh, it is
    extra output
