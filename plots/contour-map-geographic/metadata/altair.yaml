review:
  strengths:
  - Good geographic context with European basemap and country boundaries
  - Temperature gradient pattern is realistic with latitude-based cooling and regional
    features (Alps, Gulf Stream)
  - Proper use of Altair geographic projections (Mercator)
  - Color legend is well-designed with appropriate sizing and positioning
  - Contour labels are placed at strategic positions with good readability (white
    outline)
  - Interactive tooltips included for data exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Contour lines are implemented as small dark dots which are barely visible against
    the colored point grid - should be more prominent
  - The filled contour effect uses overlapping circles rather than true isoline regions,
    creating a somewhat pixelated appearance
  - Title has extra descriptive text before the required format
  - Some empty canvas space outside the data region could be better utilized
  image_description: The plot displays a temperature contour map of Europe using Altair.
    The visualization shows a grid of colored circles covering the European region,
    with temperatures ranging from -10°C (light blue/gray) in northern Scandinavia
    to approximately 30°C (dark red) in southern regions. The color gradient uses
    a reversed red-yellow-blue colormap where red represents warmer temperatures and
    blue represents cooler temperatures. The geographic basemap shows world country
    outlines in light gray (#F0F0F0) with subtle borders. A vertical colorbar legend
    on the right side displays "Temperature (°C)" with values from -10 to 30. The
    title reads "European Temperature Contours · contour-map-geographic · altair ·
    pyplots.ai" at the top. Contour labels (0°C, 10°C, 20°C) are visible as white
    text with black outlines placed at strategic positions across the map. Dark dots
    representing contour isolines are visible but subtle against the colored point
    grid.
