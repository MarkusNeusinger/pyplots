review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all Bland-Altman statistical elements (mean, ±1.96
    SD limits)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate sample size (80
    pairs)
  - Good use of Highcharts plotLines feature for horizontal reference lines with labels
  - Proper transparency on markers for overlapping observation visibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (alpha 0.1) making it harder to read values at a glance
  - Does not leverage Highcharts interactive features like custom tooltips showing
    individual measurement details
  - Red color for limits of agreement could be replaced with a more colorblind-safe
    alternative
