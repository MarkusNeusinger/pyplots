review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Campbell Diagram structure with all required elements (5 modes, 3 EO lines,
    critical speed markers)
  - Realistic rotor dynamics data with plausible frequency ranges and mode names
  - Proper critical speed intersection calculation using sign-change detection with
    linear interpolation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with reproducible seed
  - Explicit font sizing throughout ensures readability at target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - 'Engine order (EO) dashed lines use three nearly identical gray shades (#777,
    #999, #bbb) that are indistinguishable from each other and blend into the grid
    lines — this is the most significant visual defect'
  - Critical speed markers lack visual emphasis — they should be the focal point of
    a Campbell Diagram but use a muted dark red that does not stand out against the
    mode curves
  - No visual hierarchy or storytelling — the viewer is not guided to the key insight
    (where resonance occurs)
  - Legend with 9 entries in 2 small rows at the bottom is hard to parse quickly
  - Library usage is generic — does not leverage pygal-distinctive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram rendered by pygal as an
    XY chart at 4800x2700 px on a white background. The title "campbell-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in a dark font. The X-axis is labeled "Rotational
    Speed (RPM)" ranging from 0 to 6000, and the Y-axis is labeled "Frequency (Hz)"
    ranging from 0 to 120, both with "Hz" suffix on Y tick labels and whole-number
    RPM ticks on X. Five natural frequency mode curves are drawn as solid lines: 1st
    Bending (blue, rising gently), 2nd Bending (teal, rising moderately), 1st Torsional
    (purple, decreasing slightly), Axial (orange, decreasing), and 2nd Torsional (dark
    green, rising). Three engine order excitation lines (1x, 2x, 3x EO) are drawn
    as dashed diagonals from the origin in three very similar light-gray shades. Red/maroon
    dots mark approximately 15 critical speed intersections. A two-row legend at the
    bottom lists all 9 series. Grid lines are subtle light gray. The EO lines are
    difficult to distinguish from the grid due to their similar gray tones. Overall
    the plot is legible and correctly structured but the visual differentiation between
    EO lines and grid is poor, and the color palette for the EO lines lacks contrast.'
