review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of jitter to prevent overplotting while keeping points within category
    boundaries
  - Horizontal mean lines provide useful reference for comparing group averages
  - Distinct colors for each department make categories easily distinguishable
  - Appropriate alpha transparency (0.6) handles point overlap well
  - Clean background styling with subtle grid enhances readability
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or scale context (e.g., Survey Score (1-10))
  - No legend explaining what the horizontal lines represent (group means)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a strip plot showing survey scores (y-axis,
    range 0-11) across four departments (x-axis: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR).
    Each department has its own distinct color: Engineering in blue (#306998), Marketing
    in yellow (#FFD43B), Sales in green (#4CAF50), and HR in pink (#E91E63). Individual
    data points are scattered with horizontal jitter within each category to show
    distribution. Black horizontal lines indicate the group mean for each department.
    The background is a light gray (#fafafa), with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines.
    The title "strip-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. Points have
    white borders and moderate transparency (alpha 0.6).'
