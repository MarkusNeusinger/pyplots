review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data context using software module dependencies
  - Clear directional arrows with curved paths that prevent overlap
  - Good color scheme with four distinct, colorblind-safe colors
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper legend placement and accurate labeling
  - Nodes are well-sized with good contrast between label text and fill
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is only used for styling (set_theme, color_palette) rather than its plotting
    functions; the actual visualization uses matplotlib directly (ax.scatter, FancyArrowPatch)
  - No demonstration of edge weights/thickness as mentioned in the spec
  - Node labels could be larger (14-16pt) for better readability at full resolution
  - Manual node positioning creates some uneven spacing in the layout
