review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of complex mosaic layout demonstrating the ASCII-art
    style pattern AAB;CCD;EFG
  - Clear visual hierarchy with larger overview panel at top and smaller metric panels
    at bottom
  - Professional color scheme using consistent Python-themed blue/yellow palette
  - Good use of height_ratios to create visual emphasis on different panels
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with appropriate data ranges
  - All seaborn plotting functions used correctly with modern API (hue parameter)
  weaknesses:
  - Main title font size (22pt) is slightly below the recommended 24pt for optimal
    legibility at 4800x2700
  - Could leverage more seaborn-distinctive features like regression lines, KDE overlays,
    or statistical annotations
  - Feature coverage could include additional plot types to better demonstrate mosaic
    flexibility
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 7-panel mosaic dashboard layout with the title "subplot-mosaic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. The layout follows an "AAB;CCD;EFG" pattern:
    - **Panel A (top-left, spanning 2 columns)**: A blue line chart showing "Revenue Trend Overview" from late December 2023 to early April 2024, with revenue ranging from ~50,000 to ~65,000 dollars.
    - **Panel B (top-right)**: A yellow scatter plot titled "Marketing ROI" showing Marketing Spend ($K) vs Conversions with blue-edged circular markers.
    - **Panel C (middle-left, spanning 2 columns)**: A bar chart "Sales by Channel" showing four bars (Online, Retail, Partner, Direct) in blue and yellow colors.
    - **Panel D (middle-right)**: A histogram "Response Times" showing a bimodal distribution of response times in milliseconds.
    - **Panel E (bottom-left)**: A small blue line chart "CPU Usage" showing hourly CPU percentage.
    - **Panel F (bottom-center)**: A small yellow line chart "Memory Usage" showing hourly memory percentage.
    - **Panel G (bottom-right)**: A box plot "Latency" showing latency distribution across four regions (North, South, East, West) with different colored boxes.
    All panels have subtle gray grid lines, clear axis labels with units, and appropriate font sizes.

        comment: Uses seaborn's lineplot, scatterplot, barplot, histplot, and boxplot
          effectively; however, doesn't leverage seaborn-specific features like regplot,
          kdeplot, or FacetGrid that would distinguish from pure matplotlib
  verdict: APPROVED
