review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curve with all required elements (diagonal
    reference, 10 bins, metrics)
  - Both Brier Score and ECE metrics are calculated correctly and displayed prominently
    in subtitle
  - Clean S-curve visualization clearly demonstrates classifier overconfidence behavior
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe Python Blue (#306998) color scheme
  - Well-structured code with clear separation of data generation, calculation, and
    visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning creates slight visual imbalance with empty space on right side
    of plot
  - Interactive HTML version does not leverage Highcharts tooltips to show bin counts
    or additional information on hover
  image_description: 'The plot displays a calibration curve on a white background.
    The title "calibration-curve · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold black text, with a subtitle showing "Model Calibration Analysis | Brier Score:
    0.1090 | ECE: 0.1566". The X-axis is labeled "Mean Predicted Probability" (0 to
    1) and the Y-axis is labeled "Fraction of Positives" (0 to 1). A gray dashed diagonal
    line represents perfect calibration. The classifier calibration curve is shown
    as a solid blue line (Python Blue #306998) with circular markers at each of the
    10 bin centers. The curve shows an S-shaped pattern typical of a slightly overconfident
    classifier - below the diagonal in the middle ranges. A legend in the bottom-right
    corner shows three entries: "Perfect Calibration" (dashed line), "Classifier (Brier:
    0.109)" (solid blue line), and "Calibration Points" (blue circles). The grid is
    subtle with light gray lines.'

        comment: Labels are descriptive ("Mean Predicted Probability", "Fraction of
          Positives") but lack units (though probabilities are unitless, could indicate
          "probability" or "(0-1)")

        comment: Grid is appropriately subtle; legend is functional but positioned
          in a way that creates some visual imbalance

        comment: Uses SplineSeries for smooth curves, ScatterSeries for points, proper
          Highcharts options configuration, and Selenium-based PNG export. Does not
          leverage advanced Highcharts features like tooltips or animation that would
          enhance the interactive HTML version.
  verdict: APPROVED
