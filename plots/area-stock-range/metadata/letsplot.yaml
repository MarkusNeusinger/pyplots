review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent multi-panel composition using gggrid with proper height ratios
  - Creative gradient fill effect using layered ribbons with increasing alpha values
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML export
  - Proper use of geometric Brownian motion for realistic stock price simulation
  - Clean separation between main chart, navigator, and range selector panels
  - Good visual hierarchy with the active 6M button highlighted
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines slightly too prominent (alpha 0.4 vs recommended 0.2-0.3)
  - Gradient bands create visible horizontal lines at band boundaries rather than
    smooth transition
  - No actual interactivity for range selection (static representation of what would
    be interactive)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a stock area chart with range selector consisting of three vertically stacked panels:

    1. Main chart (top): Shows 6 months of stock price data (Jul-Dec) with a gradient-filled area in blue (#306998). The gradient effect transitions from lighter at the bottom to darker near the price line. A solid blue line traces the price on top. Y-axis labeled "Price (USD)" ranges from ~180 to ~235. X-axis shows month labels (Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec).

    2. Navigator chart (middle): A mini overview chart showing the full 2-year price history with a lighter blue filled area. A selection rectangle highlights the currently displayed 6-month range in the rightmost portion.

    3. Range selector buttons (bottom): Six styled buttons labeled "1M", "3M", "6M", "1Y", "YTD", "All" with "6M" highlighted in blue as the active selection.

    The title "area-stock-range · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The overall color scheme uses Python blue (#306998) consistently. Grid lines are subtle gray. The layout is well-proportioned with the main chart taking most vertical space.
