review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style calendar heatmap that perfectly matches the spec requirements
  - Well-implemented layered approach with heatmap and month text overlays
  - Good use of weekday/weekend patterns in the simulated data for realism
  - Clean sequential green colormap that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity showing date, contributions, and day
    name
  - Rounded corners (cornerRadius=3) give a polished appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the heatmap for better visual association
  - Missing dates (if any existed) would not be visually distinct from zero-value
    cells
  - Could benefit from Altair interactivity features (selection, zoom/pan)
  image_description: The plot displays a GitHub-style calendar heatmap showing "Daily
    Contributions 2024". The visualization uses a green sequential colormap ranging
    from very light green (0 contributions) to dark green (15 contributions). The
    layout shows weekdays (Mon-Sun) on the y-axis and weeks of the year on the x-axis,
    with month labels (Jan-Dec) positioned at the top. Each day is represented as
    a rounded rectangle cell. The legend at the bottom shows the "Contributions" scale
    from 0 to 15. The title correctly includes the spec-id, library name, and pyplots.ai
    branding. Weekend days (Sat, Sun) visibly show lighter colors indicating less
    activity, while weekdays show more variation and higher contribution levels.

        comment: Uses mark_rect with cornerRadius, layered charts for month labels,
          tooltips, but could leverage more Altair-specific features like interactivity
          or selection
  verdict: APPROVED
