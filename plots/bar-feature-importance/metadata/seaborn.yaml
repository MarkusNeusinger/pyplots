review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing and no text overlap
  - Color gradient effectively communicates relative importance
  - Error bars with caps clearly show ensemble variability
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate feature names
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper seaborn 0.14+ API usage
  - Value annotations positioned well and aid interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars are added manually via matplotlib instead of leveraging seaborn built-in
    errorbar capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing feature importances
    from a machine learning credit scoring model. There are 15 features sorted by
    importance, with "Annual Income" at the top (0.180) and "Previous Defaults" at
    the bottom (0.007). The bars use a sequential "Blues" color palette that transitions
    from light blue (low importance) to dark blue (high importance). Each bar has
    error bars (whiskers) showing standard deviation, and importance values are annotated
    in blue text at the end of each bar. The title reads "bar-feature-importance ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Feature Importance"
    and the y-axis is labeled "Feature". A subtle dashed grid is visible on the x-axis
    only, and the top/right spines are removed for a cleaner look.
