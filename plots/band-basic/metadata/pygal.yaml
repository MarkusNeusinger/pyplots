review:
  strengths:
  - Creative polygon approach to create the band effect in pygal which does not have
    native fill_between
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good data generation showing widening confidence interval over time
  - Clean KISS-style code structure with proper seeding
  - Appropriate use of pygal Style customization for sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence band is nearly invisible due to excessive transparency (opacity .35
    combined with style opacity results in barely visible band)
  - Yellow center line has poor contrast against white background - consider a darker
    color like dark blue or orange
  - Grid style (dotted) is somewhat distracting compared to subtle solid lines
