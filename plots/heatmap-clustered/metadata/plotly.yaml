review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy hierarchical clustering with proper Ward's method and Euclidean
    distance
  - Dendrograms correctly rendered using manual Scatter traces to match heatmap alignment
  - Biologically meaningful data with real gene names organized by pathway (cell cycle,
    metabolism, immune, cancer)
  - Clean tumor vs normal separation visible through clustering
  - Diverging colormap correctly centered at zero
  - Proper hover template for interactive exploration
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis labels (e.g., "Genes" for Y-axis, "Samples" for X-axis) - only tick
    labels are present
  - No row/column color bars for group annotations as suggested in spec Notes (could
    annotate gene pathways or tumor/normal status)
