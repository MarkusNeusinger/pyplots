quality_score: 78
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-designed donut chart with clear visual hierarchy
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with Python Blue as primary
  - Comprehensive interactive HTML with full drilldown functionality, breadcrumbs,
    and back navigation
  - Realistic business scenario (company budget breakdown)
  - Correct title format and subtitle indicating interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - PNG slice labels show only percentages, not actual values (spec requires percentage
    and value labels)
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - donut is relatively small with excess whitespace
    below
  - Code uses function definition which violates KISS structure for plot implementations
  - Interactive drilldown logic is implemented in custom JavaScript rather than leveraging
    lets-plot native features
