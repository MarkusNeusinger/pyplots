review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized candlesticks and readable text
  - Correct OHLC data representation with distinct bodies and wicks
  - Good data generation showing realistic stock price movement with trend
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Well-positioned legend that does not obscure data
  - Subtle y-axis grid aids price level reading
  weaknesses:
  - Code specifies colorblind-safe blue/orange colors but plot renders green/red (color
    variable assignment mismatch)
  - Structure uses for loops and functions rather than pure KISS linear style
