review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of DFS maze generation algorithm ensuring exactly one
    solution
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of coord_fixed() to maintain circular proportions
  - Appropriate use of theme_void() for maze aesthetic
  - START and GOAL markers clearly distinguish entry and exit points with distinct
    colors
  - Black walls on white background is print-friendly as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more lets-plot interactive features for web version
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings.
    The maze consists of black walls on a white background, constructed using line
    segments that form both circular arc walls (between rings) and radial walls (dividing
    sectors). The center contains a red "GOAL" label, while the outer edge at the
    bottom has a blue "START" label indicating the entrance point. The maze shows
    clear passages between sectors and rings, creating a solvable path from the outer
    edge to the center. The title "maze-circular · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in black text. The layout is well-balanced with the circular maze centered
    on the square canvas.

        comment: Uses lets-plot grammar of graphics (ggplot, geom_segment, geom_text,
          scale_color_identity, coord_fixed, theme_void); good but no advanced lets-plot-specific
          features
