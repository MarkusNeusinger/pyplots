review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom implementation of Sankey diagram using Bokeh primitives (patches
    for flows, quads for nodes)
  - Smooth bezier curves create visually appealing flow paths
  - Clear energy flow context with realistic TWh values
  - Good color differentiation between sources and targets
  - Labels include both name and value for immediate data comprehension
  - Proper stacking of flows at connection points prevents visual confusion
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the color scheme for viewers not reading labels
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features (hover tooltips showing flow details)
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full resolution
