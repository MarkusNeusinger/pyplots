review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of total labels above bar stacks with clear formatting
    ($XXM)
  - Smart conditional segment labeling (only for values >=20) prevents visual clutter
  - Clean visual separation between segments using white edge borders
  - Professional styling with hidden top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Realistic quarterly revenue data that tells a growth story
  weaknesses:
  - Colors could be more colorblind-friendly (consider using a vetted colorblind palette)
  - Grid could be slightly more prominent for easier value reading
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    (Q1-Q4) broken down by four product categories: Software (dark blue), Hardware
    (golden yellow), Services (teal/cyan), and Support (coral/salmon pink). Each bar
    stack is clearly labeled with the total revenue value above it ($115M, $130M,
    $153M, $177M) in bold black text. Individual segment values are annotated in white
    text within bars for segments with values >=20. The y-axis shows "Revenue ($ Millions)"
    ranging from 0 to 200, and the x-axis shows "Quarter" with Q1-Q4 labels. A legend
    in the upper left corner identifies each color-coded category. The plot has a
    subtle y-axis grid with dashed lines and clean styling with hidden top and right
    spines.'
