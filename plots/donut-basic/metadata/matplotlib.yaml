review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent center text implementation with Total $100K providing summary information
    as specified
  - Clean color palette with Python Blue as primary color and colorblind-safe secondary
    colors
  - Proper use of wedgeprops with width=0.5 creating a well-proportioned ring
  - White edge lines between segments provide clear visual separation
  - Percentage labels positioned within the ring at appropriate distance (pctdistance=0.75)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Category size distribution could be more varied to better demonstrate donut charts
    ability to compare proportions
  - Could benefit from slightly more contrast between adjacent segments (Operations
    light blue and Marketing blue are somewhat similar)
