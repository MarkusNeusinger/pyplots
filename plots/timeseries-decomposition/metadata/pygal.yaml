review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all four decomposition components with clear visual
    separation
  - Uses statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper time series decomposition
  - Realistic CO2 data scenario with appropriate values and trends
  - Custom style configuration with proper font sizing for large canvas
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Clean color scheme with distinct, colorblind-friendly colors for each component
  - Y-axis labels properly rotated and positioned for each subplot
  - X-axis date labels only on bottom chart with appropriate rotation to prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure is complex due to pygal limitations with multi-panel layouts (requires
    PIL composition)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current alpha appears fully opaque)
  - Left margin y-axis label area could be slightly narrower for better canvas utilization
