  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scale_size_area() for perceptually accurate bubble sizing (scales
    by area, not radius)
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles with proper ggplot grammar
  - Good text sizing throughout with explicit element_text() specifications matching
    library guidelines
  - Appropriate alpha transparency (0.6) handles overlapping bubbles well
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without context or units - could use
    a more realistic scenario
  - Could showcase more plotnine features like adding a color aesthetic for a fourth
    dimension as suggested in spec notes
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with approximately 50 data points
    on a clean minimal theme background. The x-axis ranges from 6 to 14 (labeled "X
    Value") and the y-axis from approximately 7 to 14 (labeled "Y Value"). All bubbles
    are rendered in a consistent blue color (#306998) with transparency (alpha ~0.6).
    Bubble sizes vary noticeably, representing the third dimension. A size legend
    on the right side shows three reference bubbles for sizes 25, 50, and 75. The
    title "bubble-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The overall
    layout is well-proportioned with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The data shows a positive
    correlation between X and Y values with good variation in bubble sizes.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_point and scale_size_area, theme_minimal,
          element_text customization. This is standard plotnine usage but doesn't
          showcase advanced features like faceting or additional aesthetics
  verdict: APPROVED
