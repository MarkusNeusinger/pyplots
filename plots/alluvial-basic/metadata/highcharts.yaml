review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial structure using Highcharts sankey with explicit
    column positioning for strict vertical ordering
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/purple/yellow) maintains visual distinction
  - 'Good use of transparency (linkOpacity: 0.4) for overlapping flow visibility'
  - Custom HTML legend provides clear color reference at bottom
  - Annotations used creatively for year labels since sankey has no native x-axis
  - Interactive HTML version with meaningful tooltips showing voter counts
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra text before required format; should be just spec-id · library
    · pyplots.ai
  - Subtitle font size could be slightly larger for better readability at 4800x2700
  image_description: 'The plot displays an alluvial diagram visualizing voter migration
    between three political parties (Conservative, Moderate, Progressive) across three
    election cycles (2016, 2020, 2024). The diagram uses a colorblind-safe palette:
    blue (#306998) for Conservative, purple (#9467BD) for Moderate, and yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Progressive. Nodes are arranged in three vertical columns representing each
    year, with curved bands connecting nodes to show voter flow transitions. The title
    "Voter Migration · alluvial-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    with a descriptive subtitle. Year labels (2016, 2020, 2024) appear at the bottom
    of each column, and party names label each node. A horizontal legend at the bottom
    identifies the three party colors.'
