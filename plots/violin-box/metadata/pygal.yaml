review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule for bandwidth selection
  - Clean visualization with four distinct distribution shapes showing variety
  - Proper box plot statistics (median, quartiles, whiskers, outliers) all implemented
    correctly
  - Good use of stroke styles to differentiate box elements (thicker median line,
    thinner whiskers)
  - Title follows correct format
  - Outliers are properly identified and displayed as distinct points
  - Professional color scheme with appropriate transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Box plot boxes use similar colors to the violins, reducing internal contrast -
    white/neutral fill for boxes would improve visibility
  - No legend explaining the box plot elements (median line, quartile box, whiskers)
  - Axis label Performance Score could include units or clarification
