review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex specialized chart type from scratch
  - All Smith chart grid elements (resistance circles, reactance arcs) are mathematically
    correct with proper clipping to unit circle
  - Comprehensive labeling including Open/Short/Inductive/Capacitive annotations at
    chart boundaries
  - Optional VSWR circles add engineering value beyond the basic spec requirements
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining each section
  - Realistic antenna impedance data that creates a visually interesting spiral pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.6 is slightly too prominent; 0.3-0.4 would provide subtler background
  - Does not leverage distinctive matplotlib features (uses only basic plot, scatter,
    text, annotate)
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance visualization.
    The outer boundary is a solid blue circle representing |Γ|=1 (total reflection).
    Inside, gray constant resistance circles (labeled 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) are drawn
    centered along the horizontal axis, and constant reactance arcs curve from the
    right edge. The chart shows inductive (+jX) on the upper half and capacitive (-jX)
    on the lower half, with labels at the cardinal positions. A yellow impedance locus
    curve traces the antenna impedance sweep from 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz with circular
    markers at each frequency point. Key frequencies (1.0, 2.2, 3.4, 4.7, 6.0 GHz)
    are labeled with black arrows. Three red dashed VSWR circles (1.5, 2, 3) are drawn
    concentrically from the center. The matched condition (Z=Z₀) is marked at the
    center with a blue dot. Corner labels indicate "Open (Γ=1)", "Short (Γ=-1)", "+jX
    (Inductive)", and "-jX (Capacitive)". The legend in the upper left shows "Matched
    (Z=Z₀)", "Impedance Locus", and "VSWR=1.5".
