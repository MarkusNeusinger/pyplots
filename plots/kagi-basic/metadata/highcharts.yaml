review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color scheme using blue and orange instead of traditional
    red-green
  - Proper Kagi chart algorithm with 4% reversal threshold correctly implemented
  - Good visual distinction between Yang (thick) and Yin (thin) lines
  - Well-structured code with clear data generation and Kagi calculation logic
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean canvas utilization with balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries import from highcharts_core.options.series.area is unconventional (should
    be from .line module)
  - Legend could be slightly more prominent for the large canvas size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kagi chart showing stock price analysis
    with a 4% reversal threshold. The chart uses a white background with a clear title
    "kagi-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top, followed by a subtitle "Stock
    Price Analysis with 4% Reversal Threshold". The X-axis shows "Kagi Line Index"
    ranging from 0 to 12, and the Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately
    $86 to $130. The chart displays two series: Yang (Bullish) segments in blue (#306998)
    with thicker lines, and Yin (Bearish) segments in orange/gold (#E69F00) with thinner
    lines. The price movement shows multiple trend reversals - starting around $100,
    rising to ~$104, dropping to ~$90, rising again, and ultimately reaching ~$127
    by the end. The legend at the bottom clearly identifies "Yang (Bullish)" and "Yin
    (Bearish)" series. Grid lines are subtle with light gray color. The layout is
    well-balanced with good use of canvas space.'
