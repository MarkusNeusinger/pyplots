review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex dashboard layout using matplotlib inset_axes
    for sparklines and status bars
  - Smart color logic that correctly inverts good/bad colors for Error Rate and Response
    Time metrics
  - Clean visual hierarchy with status bar, label, value, change indicator, and sparkline
    in each tile
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.3) for sparkline fill areas
  - Consistent styling across all tiles with appropriate fonts and spacing
  weaknesses:
  - Change indicator arrows and colors could be slightly larger for better visibility
    at a glance
  - Status bar could include a small text label (e.g., CRITICAL) for accessibility
    alongside the color
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x2 grid of dashboard metric tiles showing
    6 server monitoring KPIs. Each tile has a colored status bar at the top (green
    for good, yellow for warning, red for critical), a metric name in bold, a large
    prominent value with units, a change indicator with up/down triangle arrows and
    percentage (green for favorable, red for unfavorable), and a mini sparkline chart
    at the bottom showing the trend. The tiles are: CPU Usage (45%, down 5.2%, green
    status), Memory (72%, up 8.1%, yellow warning status), Response Time (120ms, down
    15.3%, green status), Requests/s (2450, up 12.7%, green status), Error Rate (2.3%,
    up 45.0%, red critical status), and Disk I/O (156MB/s, down 3.8%, green status).
    The sparklines use the same color as the status bar with semi-transparent fill
    areas. The overall layout is clean with a light gray tile background and subtle
    borders.'
