review:
  strengths:
  - Good visual hierarchy with clear title and selection count
  - Effective use of color and alpha for selection highlighting
  - Yellow dashed vertical line clearly shows selection threshold
  - Consistent color encoding across all three views
  - Uses plotnine grammar of graphics appropriately
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels in right panel are overlapping/compressed making them hard to read
  - Missing histogram and bar chart views that are explicitly required by the specification
  - Uses PIL for image composition instead of native plotnine faceting
  - Code in repository creates scatter+histogram+bar but displayed image shows 3 scatter
    plots
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays three coordinated scatter plots arranged horizontally. The main title reads "linked-views-selection · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Selection: x > 4.5 (58/150 points selected)".

    **Left panel (Scatter x vs y):** Shows points scattered with x-axis ranging from 2-6 and y-axis from 0-8. A vertical yellow dashed line marks the selection threshold at x=4.5. Selected points (right of the line) are shown in blue with higher opacity, while unselected points (left of the line) are displayed in light gray with reduced opacity.

    **Middle panel (X vs Value):** Displays the same selection highlighting pattern. X-axis ranges from 2-6, y-axis (Value) ranges from 20-70. The yellow dashed selection line is present. Selected points cluster in the upper right, showing they have higher Value scores.

    **Right panel (Y by Category):** Shows Y values plotted against categories, with the same blue/gray selection coloring. The x-axis labels appear compressed/overlapping at the bottom (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.), suggesting categorical encoding issues.

    A legend at the bottom center shows "Selection" with "Selected" (blue dot) and "Unselected" (gray dot).
