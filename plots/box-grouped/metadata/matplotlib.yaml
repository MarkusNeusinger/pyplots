review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent grouped box plot with clear visual separation between experience levels
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal)
  - 'Data shows meaningful variation: Junior employees have wider distributions, Senior
    more consistent'
  - Outliers properly displayed and styled with matching colors
  - Clean, readable KISS-style code with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper left could potentially overlap with high outliers; upper
    right might be safer
  - Data pattern is quite uniform across departments (all show same Junior<Mid<Senior
    progression) - more inter-department variation would be more interesting
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like notched boxes to show confidence intervals
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot showing employee performance
    scores (0-100) across 4 departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing, Support).
    Each department has 3 side-by-side box plots representing experience levels: Junior
    (dark blue #306998), Mid-Level (yellow #FFD43B), and Senior (teal #4ECDC4). The
    boxes clearly show medians (dark horizontal lines), interquartile ranges, whiskers
    extending to 1.5*IQR, and several outliers (visible as circles, e.g., around 20
    in Engineering Junior, and in the 40 range for Support Mid-Level). A legend in
    the upper left identifies the three subcategories. The title "box-grouped · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Y-axis shows "Performance Score (0-100)"
    and X-axis shows "Department". A subtle horizontal grid aids readability.'
