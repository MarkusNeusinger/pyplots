review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of RdBu_r diverging colormap centered at zero for correlation visualization
  - Spike lines (crosshairs) implemented for hover navigation on large matrix
  - Clear title following spec-id format with proper spacing
  - Good matrix size (25x30) demonstrating interactive exploration value
  - HTML export included for full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are slightly crowded at 45-degree angle for 30 features
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x30 interactive heatmap with a diverging
    red-blue (RdBu_r) colorscale centered at zero. The title "heatmap-interactive
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top center in large font.
    The Y-axis shows "Variables" (Variable 1 through Variable 25) with clear, readable
    labels. The X-axis shows "Features" (Feature 1 through Feature 30) with labels
    rotated at -45 degrees. A colorbar on the right indicates "Correlation" values
    ranging from -1 (dark blue) to 1 (dark red), with 0 represented as white/neutral.
    The matrix shows structured correlation patterns with visible block structures,
    demonstrating both positive (red) and negative (blue) correlations across the
    data. Individual cells are clearly distinguishable with good color contrast. The
    layout uses a white background (plotly_white template) with balanced margins around
    the heatmap.
