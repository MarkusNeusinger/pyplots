review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE-based violin shapes using scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
    with proper normalization
  - Smart swarm point jittering algorithm that respects violin boundaries by scaling
    jitter to local density
  - Good color contrast between semi-transparent blue violins and opaque yellow points
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with all elements clearly readable
  - Clean, KISS code structure with good reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive tooltips on swarm points (would showcase Bokeh
    interactivity strength)
  - Small Bokeh toolbar visible in corner is not very useful for PNG output
  - Could benefit from slight median/quartile indicators within the violins
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes arranged horizontally representing
    different experimental conditions (Control, Low Dose, Medium Dose, High Dose)
    for reaction time data. Each violin is rendered in Python Blue (#306998) with
    approximately 40% transparency (semi-transparent light blue appearance). Yellow/gold
    circular markers (Python Yellow #FFD43B) with dark gray outlines are overlaid
    as swarm points within each violin, showing individual data observations. The
    title "violin-swarm · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left. The Y-axis
    shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 150-450ms, and the X-axis
    shows "Experimental Condition" with the four category labels. The violins display
    different distribution shapes - Control and Low Dose are more symmetric, Medium
    Dose has a wider spread, and High Dose is more compact and lower on the scale.
    Grid lines are subtle with dashed styling. There is a small Bokeh toolbar visible
    in the top-right corner.'
