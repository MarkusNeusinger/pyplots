review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts tilemap with hexagon tileShape as creative approach
    to hexbin visualization
  - Strong data storytelling with three annotated activity zones and informative subtitle
    summarizing key findings
  - Professional viridis color palette with custom 6-stop gradient for perceptually
    uniform density mapping
  - 'Clean visual refinement: grid removed, subtle axis lines, transparent hexagon
    borders, disabled hover states'
  - Comprehensive typography hierarchy with all font sizes explicitly set for the
    4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Axis values are bin indices (0-18) labeled as longitude/latitude degrees — slightly
    misleading
  - Manual hexagonal binning calculation adds code verbosity that could be simplified
  - Post-render JS patches needed for border styling and annotations indicate SDK
    serialization gaps
  improvements: []
  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization titled "Seismic
    Activity Density · hexbin-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Three
    monitoring zones detected — peak intensity: 344 events/bin (SE quadrant) · 10,000
    readings across 240 hexagonal bins". The chart uses a Highcharts tilemap with
    hexagonal tile shapes to represent point density across a 2D grid. The color scale
    follows a viridis-like gradient from dark purple (low density, ~0 events) through
    teal and green to bright yellow (high density, ~350 events). Three distinct density
    clusters are visible: (1) upper-center labeled "Moderate Activity (211 events/bin)"
    in teal/green tones, (2) center-left labeled "Low-Activity Spread (121 events/bin)"
    in dark purple/blue tones, (3) lower-right labeled "High-Intensity Hotspot (344
    events/bin)" in bright yellow/green. The X-axis is labeled "Longitude Grid (°E)"
    and Y-axis "Latitude Grid (°N)". A vertical color bar on the right shows "Event
    Count" from 0 to 350. Hexagons have subtle white borders. Annotations are styled
    with rounded borders and semi-transparent white backgrounds. Overall layout is
    clean with generous margins.'
