review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of RSI indicator with all required visual elements (thresholds,
    zones, centerline)
  - Proper RSI calculation using 14-period smoothed average method
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: BoxAnnotation for zones, Span for threshold
    lines, ColumnDataSource'
  - Scatter point emphasis on extreme values highlights trading signals
  - Clean, readable code structure with proper data generation
  - Color scheme is accessible and visually appealing with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned in far corner and appears small relative to the plot
  - Could add HoverTool for interactive inspection of RSI values
  image_description: The plot displays an RSI Technical Indicator Chart spanning January
    to June 2024. A blue line (line width 4) traces the RSI values across 120 trading
    days. The y-axis is correctly fixed from 0 to 100. The overbought zone (70-100)
    is shaded in light pink/red (#FF6B6B at 15% opacity) with a red dashed threshold
    line at 70. The oversold zone (0-30) is shaded in light cyan/teal (#4ECDC4 at
    15% opacity) with a green dashed threshold line at 30. A gray dotted centerline
    at 50 divides bullish/bearish bias. Red scatter points (size 18) highlight overbought
    conditions around late February and late May/June. Green scatter points mark oversold
    conditions around late March through early May. The title "indicator-rsi · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" appears in the upper left with 32pt font. A legend "RSI (14)" is
    positioned in the top right. The background is a subtle off-white (#FAFAFA). All
    text is clearly legible with appropriately sized fonts (title 32pt, axis labels
    24pt, tick labels 18pt) for the 4800x2700 canvas.
