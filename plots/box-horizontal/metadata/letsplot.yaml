review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with varied distributions showcasing boxplot features (different
    medians, spreads, outliers)
  - Clean horizontal orientation with readable service type labels
  - Good color contrast between blue boxes and yellow outliers
  - Realistic tech scenario with appropriate response time values
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (alpha reduced) for better visual balance
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like interactive tooltips or
    hover information
  - Minor empty space on right side of plot due to outlier distribution
