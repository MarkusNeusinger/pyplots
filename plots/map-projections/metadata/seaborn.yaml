review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent educational value showing four projections side-by-side for comparison
  - Well-implemented Tissot indicatrices that clearly demonstrate projection distortion
  - Clean, professional color scheme with good accessibility
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good mathematical implementations of projection algorithms
  weaknesses:
  - Uses functions/classes instead of KISS linear structure (imports → data → plot
    → save)
  - Simplified coastlines are schematic rather than realistic country boundaries
  - Does not use seaborn plotting functions (sns.scatterplot, sns.lineplot, etc.)
    - only uses sns.set_theme() for styling
  - No latitude/longitude axis annotations on the maps
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid comparing four different map projections:
    Mercator (top-left), Mollweide (top-right), Robinson (bottom-left), and Sinusoidal
    (bottom-right). Each subplot shows simplified world coastlines (continents) in
    a muted green color (#c8d8c8) with dark blue outlines (#306998), against a light
    blue ocean background (#d4e8f7). Gray graticule lines (latitude/longitude grid)
    appear at 30-degree intervals. Yellow ellipses (Tissot indicatrices) with gold
    outlines are placed at regular intervals across each map to visualize projection
    distortion - showing how circles become stretched into ellipses depending on the
    projection and location. The main title "map-projections · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. Each subplot has its projection name as
    a bold subtitle. A footer explains the purpose of the yellow ellipses. The layout
    is clean and educational.'
