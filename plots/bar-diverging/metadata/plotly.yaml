review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and appropriate bar spacing
  - Perfect implementation of diverging bar concept with clear zero baseline
  - Data sorted by value enhances pattern recognition as recommended in spec
  - Horizontal orientation ideal for displaying category labels
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Blue/yellow color scheme is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain color coding (blue=satisfied, yellow=dissatisfied)
  - X-axis label could include units like Satisfaction Score (NPS-style -100 to +100)
  - Data values could include more extreme scores closer to ±100 for fuller demonstration
