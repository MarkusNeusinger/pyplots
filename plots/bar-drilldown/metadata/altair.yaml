review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hierarchical drilldown with full JavaScript interactivity
    in the HTML version
  - Clean, declarative Altair code with proper encoding types
  - Good use of layered composition (bars + text + click hints)
  - Comprehensive breadcrumb navigation in HTML version
  - Value labels clearly formatted with dollar sign and comma separators
  - Rounded bar corners add visual polish
  weaknesses:
  - The Click to drill down text inside each bar adds visual noise to the static PNG
  - 'Two yellow shades (#FFD43B, #FFE873) are very similar and hard to distinguish'
  - Sub-category values do not always sum to parent values (minor data consistency
    issue)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a column chart with 4 bars representing sales
    by geographic region (Asia Pacific, Americas, Europe, Africa), sorted in descending
    order by value. Each bar features rounded top corners and is colored using a Python-inspired
    palette with blues (#306998, #4B8BBE) and yellows (#FFD43B, #FFE873). Value labels
    (e.g., "$520", "$450", "$380", "$180") appear above each bar in bold blue text.
    Inside each bar, italic gray text reads "Click to drill down" to indicate interactivity.
    The title "bar-drilldown · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top with a
    subtitle "Sales by Region (Click a bar to drill down)". The Y-axis is labeled
    "Sales (millions USD)" and the X-axis is labeled "Category". A subtle grid (alpha
    0.3) appears on the Y-axis. The chart fills the canvas well with good proportions.'
