review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of parallel categories using plotnine basic geoms (geom_polygon,
    geom_rect)
  - Smooth cubic interpolation for ribbon curves creates professional appearance
  - Clear visual distinction between outcomes with yellow/blue color scheme
  - Effective use of transparency (alpha=0.5) for overlapping ribbons
  - Well-organized data structure with explicit path counts
  - Category labels positioned intelligently based on dimension position
  - Counts displayed inside nodes for quantitative reference
  weaknesses:
  - Middle dimension category labels positioned below nodes are slightly smaller (9pt)
    and could be harder to read
  - Some imports may be unused (coord_cartesian could be replaced with theme settings)
