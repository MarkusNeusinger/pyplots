review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart color scheme differentiating hierarchy levels with colorblind-safe palette
  - Good use of file system metaphor making the data immediately understandable
  - Adaptive label truncation prevents overlap while maintaining readability
  - Level labels on right side provide helpful context
  - Clean legend placement at bottom
  weaknesses:
  - Manual SVG construction is necessary but makes code more complex than typical
    pygal implementations
  - Some leaf nodes have very narrow rectangles making labels hard to read (e.g.,
    Cov.., Th..)
