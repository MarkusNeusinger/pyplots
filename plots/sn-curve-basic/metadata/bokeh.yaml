review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Basquin equation for realistic S-N curve generation
  - All three material property reference lines (Ultimate Strength, Yield Strength,
    Endurance Limit) are clearly displayed with appropriate colors and labels
  - Clean code structure with proper use of ColumnDataSource for both data points
    and fit line
  - Appropriate use of log-log scales as required by the specification
  - Professional styling with good font sizes and color choices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears relatively small compared to other text elements in the plot
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show exact values when hovering over data points
    (better use of Bokeh interactive capabilities)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) on a log-log scale.
    The x-axis shows "Number of Cycles to Failure (N)" ranging from 10² to 10⁷, and
    the y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from approximately 200 to 600
    MPa. Blue circular markers represent fatigue test data points (approximately 40
    points) with realistic scatter at each stress level. A solid blue line shows the
    Basquin fit curve (S = A·N^b) decreasing from upper left to lower right. Three
    horizontal dashed reference lines are displayed: red for Ultimate Strength (500
    MPa), orange for Yield Strength (350 MPa), and green for Endurance Limit (200
    MPa). Each reference line has a corresponding colored label on the left side.
    The legend is positioned in the bottom-left corner showing "Basquin Fit (S = A·N^b)"
    and "Fatigue Test Data". The title "sn-curve-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The background is a light gray (#fafafa) with a subtle dashed grid.'
