review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of text-as-markers concept using Highcharts dataLabels
  - Well-organized code with clear clustering of related tech terms
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Proper use of textOutline for text readability on white background
  - Good canvas utilization and margins prevent clipping
  - Realistic and engaging tech stack embedding scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap in Data Science cluster (Keras/Pandas/Scikit-learn region)
  - Axis labels could include context (e.g., Dimension 1 (UMAP component))
  - Could leverage more Highcharts interactive features (zooming, click events)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter visualization where text labels
    serve as data points instead of markers, positioned in a 2D space representing
    tech stack word embeddings. The title "scatter-text · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text with a gray subtitle "Tech Stack Word Embeddings
    (2D Projection)". Four distinct clusters are visible: Programming Languages (dark
    blue/navy - Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, Rust, Go, Swift) in the upper-left;
    Data Science tools (yellow/gold - Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn,
    Keras) in the upper-right; Web Frameworks (purple - React, Vue, Angular, Django,
    Flask, Node.js) in the lower-right; and Databases (cyan - PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
    Redis, MySQL, SQLite, Cassandra) in the lower-left. A bordered legend in the top-right
    identifies all four categories. Axes are labeled "Dimension 1" (x) and "Dimension
    2" (y) with subtle gray grid lines. Minor text overlap occurs in the Data Science
    cluster where "Keras", "Pandas", and "Scikit-learn" are close together.'
