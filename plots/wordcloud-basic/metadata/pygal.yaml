review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal add_xml_filter() to inject custom SVG elements, working
    around the library lack of native word cloud support
  - Good spiral placement algorithm that handles 16:9 aspect ratio with elliptical
    distribution
  - Appropriate color palette using pyplots primary colors (blue/yellow)
  - Tech buzzword theme is realistic and relatable
  - Produces both SVG and PNG output, leveraging pygal native SVG capabilities
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Minor word overlap in center cluster (DevOps/Machine area) could be improved with
    more padding
  - Words cluster heavily in center with substantial whitespace on canvas edges
  - Code uses a function definition (inject_word_cloud) which violates KISS principle
    of no functions/classes
  - Font size range (40-160) could be wider to show more dramatic difference between
    high and low frequency words
