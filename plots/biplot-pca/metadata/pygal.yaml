review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Excellent use of Iris dataset as a classic PCA example
  - Good color differentiation between species and loading vectors
  - Correct axis labels showing variance explained percentages
  - Proper title format
  - Well-scaled loading vectors relative to score points
  weaknesses:
  - Loading vectors lack proper arrowheads (using dots instead of arrows to indicate
    direction)
  - Legend representation for vectors shows squares rather than line indicators
  - No unit circle for reference on loading magnitudes
  - Sepal Width loading extends quite far vertically, creating slight visual imbalance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot using the Iris dataset with three
    species groups shown as colored scatter points: Setosa (blue), Versicolor (yellow),
    and Virginica (green). Four loading vectors extend from the origin representing
    the original features: Sepal L. (dark red), Sepal W. (purple), Petal L. (orange),
    and Petal W. (teal). The axes show PC1 (73.0%) on the x-axis and PC2 (22.9%) on
    the y-axis. The title follows the correct format "biplot-pca · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    The legend is positioned in the top-left corner and includes all series. Grid
    lines are visible but subtle. The Setosa cluster is clearly separated on the left
    side, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap on the right.'
