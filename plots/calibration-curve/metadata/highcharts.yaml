quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curve with all required elements (diagonal
    reference, 10 bins, metrics)
  - Both Brier Score and ECE metrics are calculated correctly and displayed prominently
    in subtitle
  - Clean S-curve visualization clearly demonstrates classifier overconfidence behavior
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe Python Blue (#306998) color scheme
  - Well-structured code with clear separation of data generation, calculation, and
    visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning creates slight visual imbalance with empty space on right side
    of plot
  - Interactive HTML version does not leverage Highcharts tooltips to show bin counts
    or additional information on hover
