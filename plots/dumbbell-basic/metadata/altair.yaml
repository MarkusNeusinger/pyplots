review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal dumbbell chart matching spec requirements perfectly
  - Smart data reshaping using pd.melt for the dots while keeping original data for
    lines
  - Effective use of Altair layering (lines + dots) to create the dumbbell effect
  - Data sorted by improvement reveals clear patterns as recommended in spec
  - Blue/yellow color scheme provides excellent contrast and accessibility
  - Appropriate sizing with scale_factor=3.0 for output resolution
  - Tooltips add interactivity for the HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label Satisfaction Score could include units (e.g., Satisfaction Score
    (%) or Satisfaction Score (out of 100))
  - All improvements are positive; including one department with no change or decline
    would demonstrate fuller range of dumbbell chart capabilities
  - Legend title Period could be more descriptive (e.g., Policy Change)
