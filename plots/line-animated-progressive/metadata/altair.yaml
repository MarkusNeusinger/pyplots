review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of progressive reveal concept using marker size/color
    gradient
  - Well-designed HTML version with interactive slider for frame-by-frame animation
  - Clear visual hierarchy with highlighted final point in contrasting yellow
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principle
  - Realistic temperature data with seasonal patterns demonstrates the time series
    nature well
  weaknesses:
  - The Progression annotation is placed in a somewhat awkward position and is purely
    text rather than an actual visual legend
  - No proper legend explaining the visual encoding (size/color gradient meaning)
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing monthly temperature
    readings from February 2022 to December 2024. The main line is rendered in blue
    (#306998) with a stroke width of approximately 4px. Data points are shown as circles
    overlaid on the line, with size and color intensity increasing progressively from
    left to right (smaller/lighter blue at the start, larger/darker blue at the end)
    to indicate the direction of progression. The final data point (December 2024)
    is highlighted with a prominent yellow circle (#FFD43B) with a blue border, marking
    the "current" position. A text annotation "← Progression →" appears in the upper-left
    area of the chart. The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from 0 to 34, and
    the x-axis shows "Date" with labels formatted as "Mon YYYY". The title reads "Monthly
    Temperature Readings · line-animated-progressive · altair · pyplots.ai". The seasonal
    pattern (peaks in summer, troughs in winter) is clearly visible across the 3 years.
    The background has subtle grid lines and the overall layout is clean with good
    proportions.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding, layering, params/binding for
          interactive slider in HTML version. Good use of tooltips. Could leverage
          more Altair-specific features like selections for highlighting.
