  image_description: The plot displays a stock price time series from 2006 to 2016
    with two highlighted span regions. A **yellow vertical span** marks the "Recession
    Period" from 2008 to 2009, spanning the full height of the chart. A **red/pink
    horizontal span** marks the "Risk Zone" between price levels $60-$80, spanning
    the full width of the chart. The main data is shown as a **blue line** representing
    "Stock Price" that starts around $200, dips during the recession period, and stabilizes
    around $140-150 afterward. The title reads "span-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    Axis labels show "Year" on x-axis and "Price ($)" on y-axis. A legend in the top-left
    shows all three series. Grid lines are visible but subtle.
  verdict: APPROVED
