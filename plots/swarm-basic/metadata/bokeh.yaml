review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom swarm jitter algorithm that creates proper beeswarm layout based
    on local density
  - Strong data storytelling with distinct distribution shapes per department (bimodal
    Sales, tight Engineering, outliers in HR)
  - Good visual design with white point borders, subtle grid, and professional color
    palette
  - Mean markers for each category add statistical context as suggested in spec
  - Proper 4800x2700 sizing with appropriate font sizes for the canvas
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what the horizontal black lines represent (mean markers)
  - Swarm algorithm is implemented manually rather than using a library feature
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm (beeswarm) plot showing employee performance
    scores across 4 departments: Engineering (blue points, ~45 observations clustered
    around 80), Marketing (yellow points, ~38 observations with wider spread around
    75), Sales (green points, ~52 observations showing bimodal distribution with clusters
    around 65 and 88), and HR (purple points, ~35 observations around 78 with visible
    outliers at ~45 and ~98). Each department has a black horizontal line indicating
    the mean value. Points are horizontally jittered to avoid overlap, revealing the
    full distribution shape. The background is light gray (#fafafa), with subtle horizontal
    grid lines. Title "swarm-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Y-axis
    shows "Performance Score (points)" ranging from ~30-100, X-axis shows "Department"
    with category labels.'
