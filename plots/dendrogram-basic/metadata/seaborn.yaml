review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe palette for species differentiation
  - Clean hierarchical structure clearly showing species relationships (Setosa distinct,
    Versicolor/Virginica mixed)
  - Species-colored x-axis labels with bold font enhance readability
  - Proper use of Ward linkage method for meaningful clustering
  - Good sample size (30) within recommended 10-50 range for readable dendrograms
  - Title and axis labels follow specification format exactly
  - Subtle y-axis grid with alpha=0.3 provides reference without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color markers use squares but appear slightly different shade than the
    x-axis label colors (minor visual inconsistency)
