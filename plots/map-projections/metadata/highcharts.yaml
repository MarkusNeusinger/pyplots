review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of Highcharts Maps projection capabilities with 4 distinct
    views
  - Clean 2x2 grid layout allows easy visual comparison between projections
  - Proper graticule implementation using mapline series with GeoJSON
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Consistent styling across all map panels (Python blue theme)
  - Good use of projection rotation to show different geographic focuses in Orthographic
    views
  weaknesses:
  - Graticule lines do not show degree labels (0°, 30°, 60°, etc.) which would help
    viewers understand the projection distortion
  - Some projections (Miller Cylindrical) have noticeable empty space in their containers
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 2x2 grid layout comparing four different cartographic projections of the world map. The main title "map-projections · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in dark gray text, followed by a subtitle explaining the comparison.

    Top-left (Miller Cylindrical): Shows a rectangular world map with longitude/latitude graticule lines (dashed purple) visible. Land masses are rendered in a medium blue color (#306998 - Python Blue) with white country borders.

    Top-right (Equal Earth): An oval/elliptical equal-area projection showing all continents with the same blue coloring and white borders. The graticule forms curved lines characteristic of this projection.

    Bottom-left (Orthographic - Americas): A globe view centered on the Americas showing North and South America prominently. The spherical projection displays only the visible hemisphere with graticule lines curving around the globe.

    Bottom-right (Orthographic - Africa/Europe): A globe view centered on Africa and Europe, showing these continents prominently along with parts of Asia and South America on the edges.

    All four maps use consistent styling: blue land (#306998), white country borders, light gray background panels with subtle borders, and dashed purple graticule lines. The layout is clean with good spacing between panels.
