review:
  strengths:
  - Implements squarify treemap algorithm from scratch since bokeh lacks native treemap
    support
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 5 distinct, visually appealing colors
  - Smart label sizing logic that hides labels on small rectangles to prevent clutter
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging bokeh strengths
  - Clean data structure with realistic budget allocation scenario
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for flexible data binding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the treemap content area in upper-right; could be
    positioned outside the plot area
  - No visual hierarchy indication beyond color (e.g., category grouping borders or
    nesting)
  - Code complexity from manual squarify implementation could be simplified if using
    squarify library
