review:
  strengths:
  - Creative manual hexbin implementation using geom_polygon since plotnine lacks
    native hexbin
  - Excellent color scheme (YlOrRd) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic NYC taxi pickup scenario with multiple density hotspots
  - Good geographic context with coastline base layer and water background
  - Proper use of coord_fixed for geographic accuracy
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra prefix - should be only "hexbin-map-geographic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai"
  - Grid alpha (0.6) is slightly too prominent - recommend 0.2-0.4
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning map showing taxi pickup
    density in a NYC-like metropolitan area. The visualization uses a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red)
    sequential colormap where lighter yellow hexagons represent lower pickup counts
    (~200-400) and darker red/maroon hexagons represent higher densities (~800-1200+).
    The map shows clear geographic clustering with three main hotspots: a dark maroon
    downtown core area around -74.0 longitude/40.75 latitude, an orange midtown cluster
    slightly north and east, and a red airport zone at approximately -73.8 longitude/40.68
    latitude. The plot includes a light blue background representing water, a gray
    polygon outline representing the land/coastline boundary, and properly labeled
    axes showing Longitude (°) and Latitude (°). The title follows the required format
    "Taxi Pickup Density · hexbin-map-geographic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The color
    legend on the right shows "Pickup Count" with a continuous scale from ~200 to
    1200+. Grid lines are subtle gray with good transparency.'

          Manual hexbin workaround for missing native support.
