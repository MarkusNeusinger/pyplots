review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the diverging bar chart concept with clear visual
    separation of positive/negative values
  - Perfect title format and spec compliance with all required features (contrasting
    colors, horizontal orientation, zero baseline, sorted bars)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with appropriate lets-plot grammar
    of graphics syntax
  - Good color choice with red/blue that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical to preserve sort order
  weaknesses:
  - Could add interactive tooltips to leverage lets-plot interactive capabilities
    in the HTML output
  - Data distribution slightly unbalanced (only 4 negative vs 8 positive categories)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing Net
    Promoter Scores for 12 customer satisfaction categories. Bars extend left (red,
    #DC2626) for negative scores and right (blue, #306998) for positive scores from
    a clear vertical baseline at zero. Categories are sorted by score from lowest
    (Mobile App at -35) to highest (Product Quality at +72). The title "bar-diverging
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at top center in bold. X-axis is labeled "Net
    Promoter Score" and Y-axis is labeled "Category". A legend on the right shows
    "Sentiment" with Negative (red) and Positive (blue) indicators. The layout is
    clean with a minimal theme, subtle grid lines on the x-axis only, and good use
    of whitespace.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_bar, geom_vline, scale_fill_manual,
          and theme customization. Could leverage more lets-plot specific features
          like tooltips for interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
