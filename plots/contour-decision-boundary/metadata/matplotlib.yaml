review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of decision boundary visualization meeting all specification
    requirements
  - Clear visual distinction between correctly classified and misclassified points
    using different marker styles (circles vs X)
  - Proper use of contourf for class regions with appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4)
  - White decision boundary line provides clear separation between regions
  - Good marker sizing (s=150/200) and edge colors (white/black/red) for visibility
  - Reproducible with fixed random seeds
  weaknesses:
  - Grid is barely visible despite being enabled - could use slightly higher alpha
    or different styling
  - Color palette uses coolwarm which is not optimal for colorblind accessibility
    - consider using a perceptually uniform colormap
  - Could leverage SVM decision_function to show prediction confidence as gradient
    rather than hard boundary regions
