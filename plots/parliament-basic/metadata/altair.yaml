review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular parliament visualization with proper arc arrangement
  - Seats correctly distributed with more seats in outer rows (realistic parliament
    layout)
  - Well-configured legend with party names and seat counts
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with custom color scales
  - Proper title format and good color accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Large gap between the parliament chart and the legend creates visual disconnection
  - Uses political party theme which content policy suggests avoiding for neutral
    topics
