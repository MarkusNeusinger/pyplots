not_feasible: true
not_feasible_reason: 'AR-06: Seaborn is fundamentally a 2D statistical visualization
  library and has no native 3D scatter plot capability. Any 3D implementation requires
  matplotlib''s mplot3d, with seaborn only providing styling (set_theme, set_context,
  color_palette), which violates AR-05 (library must use plot functions, not just
  styling).'
review:
  strengths:
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic molecular science context with appropriate units (nm, eV)
  - Clear 3D visualization with good viewing angle
  - Proper use of transparency for overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Seaborn cannot create 3D plots - the library lacks native 3D plotting
    functionality'
  - Implementation uses matplotlib Axes3D.scatter() instead of seaborn plot functions
  - Only seaborn styling (set_theme, set_context) and color_palette are used - violates
    AR-05
