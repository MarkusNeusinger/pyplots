review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of the elbow curve with excellent readability
  - Optimal k value (elbow point) is highlighted with a distinct larger yellow marker
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with full context
  - Clean KISS code structure following pygal best practices
  - Good color contrast between the main line and elbow highlight
  - Data realistically demonstrates the diminishing returns pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned quite far from the plot area at the bottom
  - Could use pygal built-in annotation or tooltip features to enhance the elbow point
