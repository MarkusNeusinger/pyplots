review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of interactive concepts in a static format with hover
    tooltip, zoom region, and control hints
  - Well-annotated extreme weather events (heat wave, cold snap) with distinctive
    markers and colors
  - Clean, readable typography with proper font sizes meeting spec requirements
  - Realistic temperature data with seasonal patterns and weekly variation
  - Good use of seaborn lineplot and scatterplot functions with matplotlib annotations
  weaknesses:
  - Range selector subplot mentioned in code appears cropped in the output image
  - Legend line style for Average displays as solid rather than dashed as actually
    rendered
