review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts sunburst module with proper parent-child ID references
  - Well-configured level-specific styling with brightness variations for visual hierarchy
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple) with good contrast
  - Smart label filtering on small segments prevents overlap
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that effectively demonstrates hierarchical
    data
  - Clean code structure following library best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring labels are difficult to read due to segment size and rotation
    angle
  - Could improve tooltip visibility documentation in code comments
