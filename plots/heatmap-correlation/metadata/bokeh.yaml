review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lower-triangular masking to reduce redundancy
  - Smart dynamic text coloring (white on dark backgrounds, dark on light) for readability
  - Appropriate use of Bokeh RdBu11 diverging palette reversed for correct semantic
    mapping
  - Well-chosen realistic economic data with meaningful correlation patterns
  - Square aspect ratio (3600x3600) well-suited for correlation matrix visualization
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Variables) rather than domain-specific
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities (HoverTool could show variable
    names and correlation details on hover)
