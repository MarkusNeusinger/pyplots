review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed spring layout algorithm implementation from scratch
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and HoverTool for interactivity
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with good group differentiation
  - Node size scaled by degree as specified
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: includes extra prefix instead of just {spec-id} · {library}
    · pyplots.ai'
  - Legend text is too small for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Network positioned toward upper-left leaving significant empty space in lower-right
    corner
  - Label positioning could be improved for nodes near canvas edges
