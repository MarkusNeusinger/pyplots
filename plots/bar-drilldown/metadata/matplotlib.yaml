review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using 2×2 subplot grid to show hierarchical drilldown
    in a static image
  - Clever use of white downward arrows on Level 1 bars to indicate drill-down capability
  - Clean, professional visual design with white bar edges and removed top/right spines
  - Consistent color mapping between regions in Level 1 and their respective Level
    2 panels
  - Clear value labels above each bar with proper formatting
  - Well-structured breadcrumb-style titles
  - Appropriate footnote explaining the static nature of the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit breadcrumb navigation visualization (only shown in titles, not
    as interactive UI element)
  - No legend explaining the color-to-region mapping
  - Could benefit from a visual back indicator showing navigation path
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 2×2 grid of bar charts representing a hierarchical drilldown visualization for Sales data. The main title reads "bar-drilldown · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top.

    Top-left (Level 1: Regions): Shows three bars for North America ($4500M, blue #306998), Europe ($3200M, yellow #FFD43B), and Asia Pacific ($2800M, lighter blue #4B8BBE). Each bar has a white downward arrow (↓) in the center indicating clickability for drilldown. Value labels appear above each bar.

    Top-right (Level 2: North America → Countries): Shows drilldown into North America with USA ($2800M), Canada ($1100M), and Mexico ($600M), all in the same blue color with slight transparency.

    Bottom-left (Level 2: Europe → Countries): Shows Germany ($1400M), UK ($1000M), and France ($800M) in yellow with slight transparency.

    Bottom-right (Level 2: Asia Pacific → Countries): Shows Japan ($1200M), Australia ($900M), and India ($700M) in lighter blue with slight transparency.

    All bars have white edges, value labels above them, Y-axis labeled "Sales (M$)", and spines removed from top and right. A gray italic footnote at the bottom explains this is a static representation.
