review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution to implement 3D surface in a 2D library using manual projection
    and painter's algorithm
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean, well-structured code with clear comments explaining the projection mathematics
  - Proper depth sorting ensures correct rendering order of surface facets
  - Good axis labeling and legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Rectangle-based approximation creates visual artifacts at surface edges where
    facets don't perfectly align
  - The Y-axis label says Z (height) which is confusing since Z typically refers to
    depth in 3D - should clarify this is the projected height
  - Missing interactivity - the spec mentions enabling rotation for interactive libraries
    and Altair supports interactivity but no interactive features were added
  - The projection loses some depth perception that a true 3D library would provide
