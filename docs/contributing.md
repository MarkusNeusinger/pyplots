# Contributing to pyplots

## Overview

pyplots is a specification-driven platform where **AI generates all plot implementations**. As a contributor, your main focus is on **specifications** (what to visualize) rather than code (how to implement).

---

## How to Propose a New Plot Type

1. **Create a GitHub Issue** with a descriptive title (e.g., "Radar Chart with Multiple Series")
   - Do NOT include spec-id in the title
2. **Add the `spec-request` label**
3. **Wait for automation**:
   - `spec-create.yml` analyzes your request
   - Assigns a unique spec-id
   - Creates a PR with `specification.md` and `specification.yaml`
4. **Review the generated spec** (PR comments)
5. **Maintainer adds `approved` label** to the Issue (not the PR)
6. **Spec merges to main** with `spec-ready` label

---

## How to Improve an Existing Spec

1. **Create a GitHub Issue** referencing the spec to update
2. **Add the `spec-update` label**
3. **Wait for `spec-update.yml`** to create a PR with changes
4. **Maintainer reviews and adds `approved` label**

---

## How to Trigger Implementation Generation

After a spec has the `spec-ready` label:

**Single Library:**
- Add `generate:{library}` label to the issue (e.g., `generate:matplotlib`)

**All Libraries:**
```bash
gh workflow run bulk-generate.yml -f specification_id=<spec-id> -f library=all
```

## What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Manually create `plots/` directories | Let `spec-create.yml` handle it |
| Write `specification.md` files directly | Let AI generate from your Issue |
| Include `[spec-id]` in issue titles | Spec-id is auto-assigned |
| Add `approved` label to PRs | Add it to Issues instead |
| Run `gh pr merge` on implementation PRs | Let `impl-merge.yml` handle it |
| Create `metadata/*.yaml` manually | Created automatically on merge |

---

## Why This Workflow?

Manual intervention causes:
- Missing quality scores in metadata
- Missing preview images in GCS
- Issues staying open when complete
- Broken database sync

**Trust the automation.** It handles: code generation, quality review, repair attempts, image promotion, and database sync.
