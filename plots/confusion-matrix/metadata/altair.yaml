review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast logic using alt.condition to switch between white and
    dark text based on cell value
  - Clean declarative Altair style with proper encoding types (:N, :Q)
  - Well-structured long-form DataFrame transformation for Altair grammar
  - Good use of layered composition (heatmap + text)
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for confusion matrix
  - White cell borders enhance visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing interactive tooltips which are a distinctive Altair feature
  - Legend positioning could be optimized to be closer to the plot
  image_description: The plot displays a 4x4 confusion matrix heatmap for a multi-class
    animal classification model (Dog, Cat, Bird, Fish). The matrix uses a sequential
    blue color scheme ("blues") where darker blue indicates higher counts. The diagonal
    cells (correct predictions) show high values (85, 78, 82, 91) with dark blue coloring,
    while off-diagonal cells (misclassifications) show lower values with lighter blue
    shades. Each cell is annotated with its count value - white text on dark cells
    and dark blue (#306998) text on light cells for optimal contrast. The title "confusion-matrix
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis is labeled "True Label"
    and the x-axis "Predicted Label". A vertical colorbar on the right shows the count
    scale from approximately 0-90. White cell borders provide clear separation between
    matrix cells.

        comment: Uses basic Altair features (mark_rect, mark_text, layering) but doesn't
          leverage interactive features like tooltips or selection that are Altair's
          distinctive strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
