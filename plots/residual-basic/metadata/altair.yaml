review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's transform_loess for the LOESS smoothed trend line -
    a distinctive library feature
  - Proper layering architecture with alt.layer combining zero line, scatter points,
    and trend line
  - Symmetric y-axis range (-6 to 6) around zero as recommended in spec
  - Good heteroscedasticity pattern in data with intentional outliers for realistic
    diagnostics
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for residuals this is often acceptable)
  - Data scenario is generic rather than tied to a specific real-world regression
    context
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot with blue circular markers
    (#306998) showing residuals against fitted values. The x-axis is labeled "Fitted
    Values" ranging from 5 to 55, and the y-axis is labeled "Residuals" with a symmetric
    range from -6.0 to 6.0. A dashed black horizontal reference line at y=0 clearly
    indicates the zero-residual baseline. A yellow/gold LOESS smoothed trend line
    (bandwidth 0.4) weaves through the data showing the local trend of residuals.
    The title "residual-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center.
    The data shows 100 points with visible outliers around (16, 4.5), (30, 3.8), and
    (41, -4.2), demonstrating heteroscedasticity with slightly increasing variance
    as fitted values increase. The grid is subtle with low opacity, and the overall
    layout is clean with good proportions.
