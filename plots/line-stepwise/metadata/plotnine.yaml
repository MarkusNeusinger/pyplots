review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_step with direction="hv" for proper step function visualization
  - Realistic and relatable CPU utilization scenario that perfectly demonstrates discrete
    state changes
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation following plotnine best practices
  - Well-balanced layout with appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Data shows clear daily pattern with morning ramp-up, business hours peak, and
    evening wind-down
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: panel_grid_major and panel_grid_minor use element_text() instead of element_line()
    - this does not cause visible issues but is technically incorrect for grid styling'
  image_description: The plot displays a step line chart showing CPU utilization (%)
    over a 24-hour period. The line is rendered in a blue color (#306998) with clear
    horizontal-then-vertical step transitions. The x-axis shows "Hour of Day" ranging
    from 0 to approximately 23, and the y-axis shows "CPU Utilization (%)" ranging
    from about 10% to 90%. The title "line-stepwise · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines on a white
    background. The step pattern clearly shows low utilization during night hours
    (10-15%), a steep morning ramp-up (6-10 hours), sustained high utilization during
    business hours (75-90%), and gradual wind-down in the evening.
