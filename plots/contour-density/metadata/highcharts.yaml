review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE contour extraction using marching squares algorithm
  - Beautiful viridis-inspired colorblind-safe color palette for density levels
  - Well-placed contour level labels (20%, 50%, 80%) with clear backgrounds
  - Scatter point overlay provides good context without obscuring contours
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations module for labeling
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions (marching_squares_contour, connect_segments) violating
    KISS principle - should use inline/procedural style
  - Axis labels are generic (X Variable, Y Variable) without units or context
  - Legend only shows scatter points, no density scale/colorbar explanation
