review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color palette with accessibility in mind (blue, yellow, teal)
  - Realistic e-commerce data scenario with meaningful hierarchy
  - Legend clearly explains the hierarchy levels
  - Square figure format is appropriate for circle packing
  - Category labels have white background boxes for readability
  - Title correctly formatted per spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Category circles overlap each other significantly, violating the circle packing
    principle of no overlap
  - The Home category label overlaps with the Furniture subcategory label
  - Seaborn is not ideally suited for geometric/hierarchical visualizations like circle
    packing
