review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Manhattan plot with proper chromosome coloring and
    cumulative positioning
  - Good use of Bokeh interactive tools (pan, zoom, save) for exploration of GWAS
    data
  - Clear threshold lines with labels for genome-wide and suggestive significance
    levels
  - Appropriate point sizing differentiation between significant and non-significant
    SNPs
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain color coding (blue/light blue for chromosomes, yellow
    for significant)
  - Could add HoverTool to show SNP details on mouseover, which is a key Bokeh strength
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Manhattan plot for GWAS data with approximately
    44,000 SNPs across 22 chromosomes. The x-axis shows genomic position with chromosome
    numbers (1-22) labeled below. The y-axis shows -log₁₀(p-value) ranging from 0
    to about 12. Points use alternating blue shades (darker #306998 and lighter #7BA3C9)
    for adjacent chromosomes, creating visual separation. Significant SNPs above the
    genome-wide threshold are highlighted in yellow/gold (#FFD43B) and are larger
    in size. Two horizontal threshold lines are present: a red dashed line at ~7.3
    for genome-wide significance (p = 5×10⁻⁸) and a teal/green dotted line at 5 for
    suggestive threshold (p = 1×10⁻⁵). The title "manhattan-gwas · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears in the top-left. The background is light gray (#FAFAFA). Significant peaks
    are visible on chromosomes 2, 6, 11, and 17 as specified in the data generation.
    Bokeh interactive tools are visible in the top-right corner.'
