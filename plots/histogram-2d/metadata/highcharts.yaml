review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with proper color stops for perceptual uniformity
  - Clean implementation of 2D histogram binning with numpy, translated to Highcharts
    heatmap format
  - Proper handling of headless Chrome screenshot with inline JS (avoiding CDN issues)
  - Realistic financial returns scenario with correlated bivariate data
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Sparse tick labels (every 5th bin) prevent overlap while maintaining readability
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to help read values at specific positions
  - Colorbar could have more descriptive title (e.g., Frequency Count instead of just
    Count)
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D histogram heatmap showing the joint distribution
    of correlated financial asset returns. The heatmap uses the viridis colormap (dark
    purple for low counts, transitioning through blue/teal to bright yellow/green
    for high counts ~80). The density pattern clearly shows a positive correlation
    between Asset A Return (%) on the x-axis (ranging from approximately -3.2 to 9.9)
    and Asset B Return (%) on the y-axis (ranging from approximately -0.4 to 15.5).
    The highest density (yellow/green cells) is centered around (5%, 8%), matching
    the specified mean values. A vertical colorbar on the right side labeled "Count"
    shows the scale from 0 to 80. The title "histogram-2d · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top center.

        comment: Return percentages are realistic (-3% to 10% for Asset A, -0.4% to
          15.5% for Asset B). Slightly wide range for Asset B but plausible.

        comment: Uses Highcharts heatmap module with custom colorAxis stops. Could

          zoom capabilities in HTML version.
