review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of Plotly's make_subplots capability with different chart
    types in each cell
  - Well-chosen financial dashboard scenario that naturally requires multiple visualization
    types
  - Clean color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) consistently
  - Proper use of specs parameter to define chart types per cell
  - Good axis labeling with units throughout
  - Interactive HTML export alongside static PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines would improve readability of individual subplots (add gridcolor
    and showgrid to axes)
  - Scatter markers in bottom-right subplot could be slightly larger (12-14 instead
    of 10) for better visibility
