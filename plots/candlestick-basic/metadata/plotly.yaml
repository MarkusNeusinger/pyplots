review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native go.Candlestick for clean, idiomatic implementation
  - Proper teal/red color scheme that is more accessible than pure green/red
  - Realistic price simulation with appropriate volatility and trend behavior
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correctly disabled rangeslider for cleaner static output
  weaknesses:
  - Could enhance Plotly's distinctive hover tooltips with custom hovertemplate showing
    OHLC values
  - Grid visibility is good but could add annotation or subtitle explaining color
    meaning for first-time viewers
