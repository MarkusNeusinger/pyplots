review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including y=0 reference line,
    LOWESS smoothing, ±2σ outlier bands, and outlier coloring
  - Clear U-shaped LOWESS curve effectively demonstrates non-linearity detection in
    residuals
  - Good data generation with deliberate heteroscedasticity and non-linear term to
    showcase residual analysis
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar with proper lets-plot idioms
  - Proper sizing (1600x900 base with scale=3) for 4800x2700 output
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.5 is slightly too prominent; recommended 0.2-0.4 for subtler appearance
  - Wildcard import pattern, while necessary for lets-plot, could be more explicit
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltips in HTML output for enhanced exploration
  image_description: 'The plot displays a residual plot with 150 data points. The
    main visualization uses coral/red colored scatter points for normal residuals
    and blue colored points for outliers (beyond ±2 standard deviations). A solid
    blue horizontal reference line at y=0 represents perfect predictions. Two red
    dashed horizontal lines mark the ±2σ outlier boundaries at approximately ±26.5.
    A yellow LOWESS smoothing curve clearly shows a U-shaped pattern, correctly revealing
    the non-linear relationship in the residuals (due to the deliberate quadratic
    term in the data). The x-axis shows ''Fitted Values'' ranging from ~40 to ~480,
    and the y-axis shows ''Residuals (Observed - Predicted)'' ranging from ~-25 to
    ~30. The legend on the right side distinguishes ''Outlier (>2σ)'' and ''Normal''
    point types. The title correctly follows the format: ''residual-plot · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai''. The overall layout is clean with a minimal theme and subtle gray
    gridlines.'

        comment: Points are well-sized (size=5) with appropriate alpha (0.7) for 150
          data points; slight deduction as some overlapping points in dense areas
          could benefit from slightly smaller size

        comment: Grid uses alpha=0.5 which is slightly too prominent (recommended
          0.2-0.4), and the panel_grid_major setting makes gridlines more visible
          than ideal

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_hline, geom_smooth(method='loess'),
          theme_minimal(), and proper scaling. Could have used lets-plot's interactive
          tooltip features for HTML output.
