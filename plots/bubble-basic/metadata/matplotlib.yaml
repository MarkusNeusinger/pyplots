review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of area-based size scaling as spec requires
  - Size legend clearly communicates bubble size meaning with three reference values
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.6) and edge colors to distinguish overlapping
    bubbles
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Proper font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without contextual units despite code
    comments mentioning company metrics
  - Size distribution appears somewhat random rather than showing interesting patterns
    across the X-Y space
