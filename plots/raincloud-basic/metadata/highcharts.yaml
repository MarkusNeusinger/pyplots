review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud metaphor with cloud (half-violin) on
    right, boxplot centered, and rain (jittered points) on left
  - Good use of bimodal distribution for Treatment B demonstrating feature coverage
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between categories
  - Clean KISS code structure with inline KDE computation
  - Proper use of Highcharts polygon series for density clouds
  weaknesses:
  - Box plot fill colors are too light/transparent making Q1-Q3 boxes difficult to
    distinguish from background
  - Legend shows wrong symbol for Box Plot - displays circle instead of rectangle
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent (alpha 0.35) should be more subtle
