review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of realistic budget data context with clear hierarchy (All →
    Departments → Teams)
  - Good use of Plotly donut style with center annotation for context
  - Well-implemented breadcrumb and click instruction UI elements
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with distinct hues for main categories
  - Includes both PNG (static) and HTML (interactive with drilldown JS) outputs
  - Clean hover templates showing value, percentage, and drill-down hint
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order does not match the visual clockwise ordering of slices
  - Yellow (Marketing) and orange (Sales) colors are somewhat close for certain colorblind
    types
  - The JS drilldown implementation is injected as a string which is fragile
