quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent layered visualization combining mark_boxplot and mark_circle
  - Creative use of transform_calculate with xOffset for jitter effect
  - Good data variety showing different distribution types (normal, spread, tight,
    skewed)
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (:N, :Q)
  - Appropriate font sizing throughout (18-28pt range)
  - Yellow median line provides good contrast against blue boxes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing tooltips which would enhance the interactive HTML output
  - Single color for both boxes and points reduces visual distinction between layers
  - Could benefit from different point color or outline to better distinguish strip
    from box
  - Library features score limited by not using Altair interactivity capabilities
