review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud metaphor with cloud (KDE) clearly on right, boxplot centered,
    rain (points) on left - matching the spec layout requirement
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B is clearly visible in the KDE curve, demonstrating
    the advantage of raincloud plots
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each condition
  - Proper inline KDE computation with Gaussian kernel for the half-violin clouds
  - High-resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is overly cluttered with 9 entries (Cloud, Box Plot, and Points for each
    category) - could consolidate to show just the 4 condition names
  - Grid line styling could be more subtle to reduce visual noise
