review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Code 128B encoding with proper start/stop patterns and
    check digit calculation
  - Clean, professional appearance with good color choice and typography
  - Human-readable text properly displayed below the barcode
  - Quiet zones correctly implemented for scanner compatibility
  - Realistic shipping label example data
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use seaborn plotting functions - only uses sns.set_theme() for styling,
    all rendering is pure matplotlib patches
  - Canvas utilization is poor - barcode and text occupy less than 40% of the vertical
    space
  - The aspect ratio results in a nearly square image rather than the preferred 16:9
    landscape format
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode rendered with blue (#306998)
    vertical bars on a white background. The barcode encodes "SHIP-2024-ABC123" which
    is displayed as human-readable text below the barcode in a bold monospace font
    matching the blue color. The title "barcode-code128 · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in dark gray bold text. The barcode area is enclosed in a subtle rounded
    rectangle border with light gray edges. The bars vary in width according to Code
    128 encoding standards, with proper quiet zones on both sides. The layout is clean
    with good vertical spacing between elements. The overall image has a nearly square
    aspect ratio with significant white space above and below the barcode area.
