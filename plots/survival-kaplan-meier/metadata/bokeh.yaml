review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Kaplan-Meier algorithm with proper step functions
    and Greenwood formula for confidence intervals
  - Beautiful color scheme with Python blue/yellow that provides excellent contrast
    and colorblind accessibility
  - 'All specification requirements met: step curves, CI bands, censoring marks, group
    comparison, median line'
  - 'Proper use of Bokeh features: ColumnDataSource, patch for CI areas, Span annotation'
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with appropriate sample sizes and time scales
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small relative to the plot size; could benefit from larger
    font or better positioning
  - Code uses helper functions instead of flat KISS structure preferred by guidelines
  - Censoring tick marks could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
