review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation with group clustering (200 iterations,
    proper cooling)
  - 'Clean use of ggplot2 grammar: geom_segment for edges (drawn first), geom_point
    for nodes, geom_text for labels'
  - Node degree-based sizing adds meaningful information about network centrality
  - 'Colorblind-accessible 4-color palette starting with Python blue #306998'
  - Proper label offset positioning (y + 0.04) to reduce overlap with nodes
  - Realistic office social network scenario with believable department structure
    and cross-department bridges
  - Theme properly hides axes, grid, and ticks for clean network visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend markers appear as small dots rather than matching the actual node sizes
    shown in the plot
  - Some label pairs are slightly close together (Leo/Kate, Noah/Mia areas) though
    not overlapping
  image_description: 'The plot displays a network graph visualization titled "Office
    Social Network · network-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai". It shows 20 nodes representing
    people across 4 departments: Research (Python blue #306998), Marketing (yellow
    #FFD43B), Engineering (green #2CA02C), and Design (orange #E64A19). Each node
    is labeled with a person''s name (Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.) with labels positioned
    above the nodes. Gray edges (alpha ~0.4) connect nodes to show friendship relationships.
    The layout demonstrates clear group clustering with Research at top-left, Marketing
    at top-right, Engineering at bottom-left, and Design at bottom-right. Cross-group
    connections (bridges) are visible between communities. Node sizes vary based on
    degree/connections. The legend is positioned on the right side showing department
    colors. The canvas is well-utilized with the network centered and properly scaled.'
