review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of small multiples grid to show temporal progression (appropriate
    for library lacking animation)
  - Good data story showing seismic activity spreading from Japan through Pacific
    Rim
  - Consistent legends across all panels enable easy comparison
  - Clean sequential red color palette appropriately conveys intensity
  - Correct title format and professional appearance
  - Also generates interactive HTML for final time snapshot
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows some empty categories in early panels which could confuse viewers
  - Individual map legends are somewhat small and could be more readable
  - Maps occupy relatively small portion of each panel, leaving excess whitespace
  - Small countries (Taiwan, South Korea) are difficult to distinguish at this scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2×3 grid of small multiples showing seismic
    activity temporal progression across 6 time periods (T1: Initial through T6: +72h).
    Each panel shows a world map (pygal_maps_world) with countries colored according
    to seismic intensity using a sequential red palette from very light pink (Minimal)
    to dark red (Extreme). The main title "Seismic Activity Temporal Progression ·
    map-animated-temporal · pygal · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top.
    Each individual panel has its time period label (e.g., "T1: Initial", "T2: +6h")
    and a consistent 6-category legend at the bottom showing activity levels: Minimal
    (<20), Low (20-35), Moderate (35-50), High (50-65), Severe (65-80), and Extreme
    (80+). The visualization effectively shows the spread of seismic activity from
    Japan outward to other Pacific Rim countries over time.'
