review:
  strengths:
  - 'Perfect sparkline aesthetic: no axes, gridlines, or chart chrome - exactly as
    spec requires'
  - Excellent aspect ratio (6:1) matches spec recommendation for sparklines
  - Thoughtful data generation with realistic weekly seasonality pattern
  - Min/max/first/last point highlighting with distinct colors and white edge borders
  - Clean KISS code structure with good comments explaining the data scenario
  - Proper y-margin padding prevents line from touching edges
  weaknesses:
  - Could use fill_between for subtle area fill effect (mentioned as optional in spec)
  - Line could be slightly thinner for more authentic sparkline appearance at small
    sizes
  - Library features score is modest - no advanced matplotlib techniques used
