review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts Stock native OHLC chart type with proper open/high/low/close
    data format
  - Colorblind-safe palette using Python Blue and warm amber instead of traditional
    red-green
  - Well-structured realistic stock price data with appropriate daily volatility and
    trends
  - Proper datetime axis with appropriate date formatting and stepped labels
  - Good tooltip configuration showing all OHLC values with proper currency formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra descriptive text before the required format (should be just
    ohlc-bar · highcharts · pyplots.ai)
  image_description: The plot displays an OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) bar chart showing
    stock price data over approximately 45 trading days from September to October
    2024. The chart uses a white background with a clear title at the top reading
    "Stock Price Analysis · ohlc-bar · highcharts · pyplots.ai". The Y-axis shows
    "Price (USD)" ranging from $118 to $130 with $2 intervals. The X-axis shows dates
    from Sep 02 to Oct 30 with appropriate date formatting (MMM DD). Each OHLC bar
    consists of a vertical line showing the high-low range with horizontal ticks extending
    left (open) and right (close). Bullish bars (close > open) are colored in Python
    Blue (#306998), while bearish bars (close < open) are colored in warm amber/orange
    (#E67E22). The chart shows realistic price movements with a general downtrend
    from ~$125 to ~$120 in the first half, followed by a strong uptrend to ~$129 in
    the second half. Grid lines are subtle dashed lines that help read price levels.
    The data shows a good mix of bullish and bearish days.
