review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent elbow visualization with clear annotation of optimal k=4
  - Well-designed layered chart combining line, points, and highlighted elbow marker
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with separate chart layers
  - Appropriate color scheme with Python-themed blue and contrasting yellow highlight
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional context on hover
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - No legend present to explain what the line/points represent
  - Y-axis label could note that inertia is unitless or define the metric more explicitly
