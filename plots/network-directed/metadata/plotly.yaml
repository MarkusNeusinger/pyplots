review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout algorithm that positions nodes evenly and prevents overlap
  - Clear arrow direction implementation using Plotly annotations with appropriate
    sizing
  - Well-chosen color scheme that distinguishes module groups effectively and is colorblind-accessible
  - Good use of Plotly hover template for interactive exploration
  - Title follows the exact spec-id format required
  - Realistic software dependency scenario that matches the spec example perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Some longer node labels (middleware, validators, schemas) appear slightly cramped
    within their circular markers
  - The graph does not include bidirectional edges to demonstrate curved edge handling
    mentioned in spec notes
