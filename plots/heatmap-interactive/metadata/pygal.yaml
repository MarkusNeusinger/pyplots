review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using HorizontalStackedBar to simulate heatmap grid
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly blue-to-orange color scheme
  - Good data scenario with realistic engagement score patterns
  - Comprehensive HTML version with zoom/pan/hover functionality
  - Proper XML namespace handling for SVG modification
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar legend added via XML manipulation is NOT visible in the PNG output
  - PNG static output loses all interactive features which are core spec requirements
  - Using stacked bars to simulate heatmap creates visual gaps between cells
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 20x20 heatmap grid showing website page
    engagement by user segment. The visualization uses a blue-to-orange color scheme
    where dark blue represents low engagement values (around 2-5) and dark orange
    represents high engagement (90-100). The title "heatmap-interactive · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top in gray text. The Y-axis is labeled "Page" with
    entries from Page 1 to Page 20, and the X-axis is labeled "User Segment" with
    numeric tick marks from 0 to 20. The heatmap shows clear engagement clusters -
    notably around Pages 3-6 in segments 4-8 (orange cluster), Pages 11-14 in segments
    12-17 (another orange cluster), and Pages 16-18 in segments 1-5 (lighter blue/yellow
    cluster). Individual hot spots appear as bright orange cells (e.g., Page 1/Segment
    1, Page 19/Segment 19). Critical issue: The colorbar legend that was programmatically
    added via XML manipulation is NOT visible in the PNG output - it appears to be
    outside the visible canvas or not properly rendered by cairosvg.'
