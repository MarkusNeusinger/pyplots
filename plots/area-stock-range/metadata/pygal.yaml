review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following the required pattern
  - Good use of semi-transparent fill (40% opacity) with solid line as specified
  - Realistic stock price data using random walk simulation
  - Proper axis labels with units (Price USD, Date)
  - Creative approach to simulate range selector using PIL image compositing
  - HTML output provides interactive range buttons with smooth transitions
  weaknesses:
  - Range selector buttons and mini chart navigator are NOT visible in the PNG output
    - these are the core distinguishing features per specification
  - X-axis date labels have some overlap making them harder to read
  - The PNG appears to show only the main chart without the composited button bar
    and mini navigator
  - Legend label inconsistent between code and output
  - Complex PIL-based compositing adds fragility without delivering visible results
  image_description: The plot displays a filled area chart showing stock price data
    over approximately 2 years (January 2024 to November 2025). The main chart uses
    a blue color (#306998) with semi-transparent fill (approximately 40% opacity)
    and a solid blue line on top. The price ranges from roughly $120 to $235 USD.
    The y-axis is labeled "Price (USD)" and the x-axis is labeled "Date" with monthly
    labels (e.g., "Jan 2024", "Feb 2024"). The title reads "area-stock-range · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. A small legend at the bottom left indicates
    "Stock Price". The x-axis date labels appear crowded with some overlap between
    adjacent labels. The background is white with subtle horizontal grid lines. Critically,
    the range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) and the mini chart navigator
    are NOT visible in this PNG output - only the main area chart is shown.

        comment: The implementation attempts to use pygal SVG rendering with PIL compositing
          for range navigator, but the key pygal feature of interactive SVG is only
          available in HTML output; the PNG composite appears incomplete
