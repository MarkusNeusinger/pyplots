review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all core drawdown chart features including filled
    area, max drawdown marker, and recovery points
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Comprehensive statistics annotation showing max drawdown and days to reach it
  - Proper title format and good color choices for accessibility
  - Well-calculated drawdown formula and appropriate data generation with realistic
    market patterns
  weaknesses:
  - The legend with 3 items is somewhat large for the lower right corner placement
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features (e.g., seaborn themes or palettes)
  - Generic Date axis label could be more descriptive
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart showing percentage decline
    from peak value over approximately 2 years (2022-01 to 2024-01). The drawdown
    is visualized as a filled area in semi-transparent red/salmon color (#c44e52 with
    alpha) extending from the zero baseline downward. A solid red line traces the
    drawdown boundary. The chart shows multiple drawdown periods with varying depths
    - the deepest reaching approximately -38.8% around late 2022/early 2023. A dark
    red downward triangle marker indicates the maximum drawdown point at -38.8%. Blue
    upward triangle markers at the zero line indicate recovery points (new highs)
    - visible at the start of the time series. The x-axis shows "Date" with quarterly
    tick marks, and the y-axis shows "Drawdown (%)" ranging from about -40% to 0.
    A statistics box in the lower left displays "Max Drawdown: -38.8%" and "Days to
    Max DD: 311". The legend in the lower right identifies the drawdown fill, max
    drawdown marker, and recovery markers. The title follows the required format:
    "drawdown-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
