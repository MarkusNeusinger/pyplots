review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly spaced bars
  - Colorblind-safe color palette using Python brand colors plus complementary green
  - Value labels on bars enhance precise comparisons as suggested in spec notes
  - Data tells a realistic story with different growth patterns per product line
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper left may conflict with data if values were higher in
    Q1 (upper right or outside plot would be safer)
  image_description: The plot displays a grouped bar chart with quarterly sales data
    (Q1-Q4) for three product categories. Electronics is shown in Python Blue (#306998),
    Clothing in Python Yellow (#FFD43B), and Home & Garden in green (#4CAF50). Each
    category group contains three side-by-side bars with value labels displayed above
    each bar (e.g., 245, 178, 125 for Q1). The title "bar-grouped · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The y-axis label reads "Sales (Thousands USD)" with values
    from 0 to ~450, and the x-axis shows "Quarter" with Q1-Q4 labels. A legend in
    the upper left corner identifies each product line. Subtle dashed grid lines appear
    on the y-axis with good transparency.

        comment: Grid at alpha=0.3 is good, but legend could be positioned in less
          data-relevant area (upper right would be better as it doesn't interfere
          with potential higher values)
