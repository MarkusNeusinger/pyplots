review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of sparkline minimalism - no axes, gridlines, or labels
    as specified
  - Clean use of Plotly graph_objects with multiple traces for different highlight
    points
  - 'Good color choices: Python blue for line, semantic colors for min (red) and max
    (green)'
  - Proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with scale=3
  - Includes both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic data scenario (daily sales with upward trend and noise)
  weaknesses:
  - The first point yellow marker partially overlaps with the line start, making it
    slightly less visible than the last point marker
