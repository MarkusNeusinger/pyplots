review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with well-proportioned trapezoidal segments
  - Clear blue-to-gold color progression that aids visual hierarchy
  - 'Perfect text contrast: white text on blue, dark text on gold backgrounds'
  - Uses exact data from specification (sales funnel example)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Conversion rate annotations (coded in lines 88-99) are not visible in the rendered
    output - may be positioned outside canvas bounds
  - Could use seaborn color palette more distinctively (e.g., using a named sequential
    palette)
