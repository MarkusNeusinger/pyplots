review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent branding
  - Realistic sales data with seasonal patterns and year-over-year growth
  - Proper use of value_formatter for currency display
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - No slider widget implemented - the spec requires interactive slider control but
    this is just a static grouped bar chart showing all years simultaneously
  - Color palette has two very similar blue shades and two similar yellow shades making
    year differentiation difficult
  - Does not leverage pygal SVG/HTML interactivity capabilities that could potentially
    simulate slider behavior through JavaScript
  - Legend at bottom with tiny color swatches is hard to read
