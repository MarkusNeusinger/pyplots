review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and well-proportioned layout
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate data range
  - Clear bin separation with white edges enhances readability
  - Title follows the exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Could showcase seaborn-specific features like KDE overlay (kde=True) to differentiate
    from matplotlib
  - Data shows only unimodal distribution; adding slight skew or outliers would better
    demonstrate histogram capabilities
