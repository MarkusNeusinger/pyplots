  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of forest plot structure with clear visual hierarchy
  - Proper diamond shape for pooled estimate using geom_polygon
  - Study labels and effect size values clearly displayed on left and right sides
  - Good color choices with Python blue (#306998) and yellow accent (#FFD43B)
  - Appropriate sizing for all text elements following quality guidelines
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic meta-analysis data context with meaningful study names
  weaknesses:
  - All individual study effects are negative; including some positive effects would
    better demonstrate the plot ability to show heterogeneous results
  - Grid lines only on x-axis (though appropriate for forest plots, full grid could
    be considered)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a forest plot with 10 individual studies listed
    vertically on the left side (Smith 2018 through Anderson 2023), each with a blue
    horizontal error bar representing the confidence interval and a blue dot at the
    point estimate. A vertical dashed gray line at x=0 marks the null effect reference.
    At the bottom, a yellow diamond shape represents the pooled estimate. On the right
    side, effect sizes with confidence intervals are displayed in text format (e.g.,
    "-0.45 [-0.72, -0.18]"). The pooled estimate is shown in bold ("-0.31 [-0.46,
    -0.15]"). The title follows the required format: "forest-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai".
    The x-axis is labeled "Mean Difference (Treatment - Control)". The background
    is white with subtle light gray vertical grid lines.'

        comment: Shows both significant (CI not crossing 0) and non-significant results;
          varying CI widths; pooled estimate clearly shown. Could have more variation

        passed: true
        comment: Good use of geom_errorbarh, geom_point with size identity, geom_polygon
          for diamond, geom_text for labels. Uses ggplot properly but doesn't showcase
          any particularly distinctive plotnine features beyond standard ggplot grammar.
  verdict: APPROVED
