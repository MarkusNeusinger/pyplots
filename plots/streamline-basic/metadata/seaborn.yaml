review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with proper font sizes and colorblind-safe palette
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format as per specification
  - Good demonstration of vortex flow physics
  - Proper use of viridis colormap for continuous data
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Implementation uses matplotlib streamplot() function rather than seaborn
    plotting functions - seaborn has no native streamplot capability, making this
    essentially a matplotlib implementation with seaborn theming'
  - Axis labels lack units (should be X Position (m) or similar context)
  - Colorbar label could be more specific (e.g., Velocity Magnitude (m/s))
