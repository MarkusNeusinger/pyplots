review:
  strengths:
  - 'Correct raincloud metaphor: clouds above baseline, rain below, box centered —
    layout is faithful to specification'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good distinction between groups
  - Realistic reaction time data with appropriate outliers and different distribution
    characteristics
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to compose a complex visualization that pygal doesn't
    natively support
  - Dual HTML/PNG output leverages pygal's SVG-native capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'Box plot elements are nearly invisible: box_width=0.10 and cap_width=0.06 are
    too thin, and stroke widths don''t compensate enough at 4800x2700 resolution.
    The median, IQR, whiskers, and caps need to be substantially larger to be clearly
    visible.'
  - 'Layout has clipping issues: the y-axis title and some category labels appear
    cut off at the edges. The margin=80 is insufficient for the font sizes used.'
  - 'No data storytelling: annotations highlighting key differences between treatment
    groups would elevate the visualization significantly.'
  - The box plot creates 8 separate series per group (24 total), making the code very
    verbose. Consider whether a simpler box representation would work.
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with three treatment
    groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction Time (ms)
    on the x-axis ranging from 100 to 700. Each group is rendered in a distinct color:
    Control in dark blue (#306998), Treatment A in golden yellow (#FFD43B), and Treatment
    B in green (#4CAF50). For each group, a filled half-violin (cloud) extends upward
    from the category baseline, jittered scatter points (rain) appear below the baseline,
    and a small box plot with median line, IQR box, whiskers, and caps sits centered
    on the baseline. The box plot elements are drawn in black but are very small and
    difficult to distinguish against the other elements. The title reads "raincloud-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Reaction Time (ms)" and
    the y-axis is labeled "Treatment Group". The background is white with subtle gray
    grid lines. The distributions show Control centered around 450ms with the widest
    spread, Treatment A around 380ms, and Treatment B around 320ms with the tightest
    distribution.'
