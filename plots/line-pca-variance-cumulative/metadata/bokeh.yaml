review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-distinctive features: Band for area fill, HoverTool for
    interactivity, dual PNG+HTML export'
  - Strong data storytelling with glow-ring highlighted threshold crossings and clear
    annotations at decision points
  - Real dataset (Wine) provides authentic PCA variance distribution rather than synthetic
    data
  - Thoughtful colorblind-safe palette with teal/purple threshold differentiation
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-proportioned for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - HoverTool renderer attachment uses fragile magic index p.renderers[2] — could
    break if render order changes
  - Right-edge threshold labels (90%, 95%) are positioned close to the canvas boundary
    and could benefit from slightly more margin
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance curve for
    PCA on the Wine dataset with 13 principal components. A dark blue line with circular
    markers traces the cumulative variance from ~36% (component 1) rising steeply
    through the first few components and flattening as it approaches 100% at component
    13. Light blue semi-transparent bars underneath show each component''s individual
    variance contribution, forming a decreasing pattern. A subtle blue-gray band fills
    the area under the cumulative curve. Two horizontal dashed threshold lines cross
    the plot: a teal/cyan line at 90% and a purple line at 95%. The 90% crossing point
    is highlighted at component 8 (92.0%) with a teal glow-ring marker and annotation
    text. The 95% crossing is highlighted at component 10 (96.2%) with a purple glow-ring
    marker and annotation. Threshold labels "90%" and "95%" appear in matching colors
    on the right edge. The title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    centered at top. Axis labels are "Number of Principal Components" (x) and "Explained
    Variance (%)" (y). A legend in center-right shows "Individual Variance" and "Cumulative
    Variance". The background is light gray with subtle dashed y-grid lines and nearly
    invisible dotted x-grid lines. All text is clearly readable.'
