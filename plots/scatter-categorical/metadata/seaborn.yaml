review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Iris flower dataset context - classic, well-understood scientific
    scenario
  - Perfect text sizing with 24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks - all highly readable
  - Custom colorblind-safe palette with good color contrast between categories
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good marker sizing (s=200) and transparency (alpha=0.7) for 150 data points
  - White edge borders on markers improve visibility and separation
  - Three distinct clusters clearly demonstrate categorical grouping
  weaknesses:
  - Grid uses dashed linestyle which is slightly more distracting than solid with
    low alpha
  - Does not utilize seaborn's style parameter to vary marker shapes by category as
    suggested in spec
  - Could use seaborn's built-in 'colorblind' palette instead of custom colors
