review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual execution with clear explosion effect on the market leader slice
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to build pie chart from scratch in
    plotnine
  - Clean layout with well-proportioned pie and properly positioned custom legend
  - Percentage labels are bold white and readable against colored slices
  - Title follows correct format specification
  - Realistic market share scenario with plausible data
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function (create_pie_segment) which violates the KISS principle
    of no functions/classes
  - Red and green segments could pose mild colorblind accessibility issues
