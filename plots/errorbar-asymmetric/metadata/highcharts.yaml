review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation combining columnrange with scatter series for asymmetric
    errors
  - Excellent data scenario with realistic quarterly sales forecast
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette (blue and yellow)
  - Clear subtitle explaining what the confidence intervals represent
  - Good code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Missing error bar caps at the ends of the ranges (spec requirement: Error bars
    should have visible caps)'
  - Y-axis starting at 0 wastes canvas space when data ranges from ~11 to ~23
  - Legend positioned far from the data in isolated corner
  - Could use Highcharts native errorbar series type instead of columnrange for more
    authentic error bar appearance
