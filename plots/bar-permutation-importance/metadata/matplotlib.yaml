review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including sorted bars,
    error bars, color gradient, and x=0 reference line
  - Uses wine dataset feature names which provides realistic, domain-appropriate context
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper sizing (16x9, fontsize 24/20/16)
  - Color gradient with colorbar adds visual emphasis as specified
  - Error bars with proper styling (capsize, linewidth) enhance readability
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label lacks units (e.g., (fraction) or (score decrease)) for full clarity
  - Could demonstrate more edge cases like several features with very similar near-zero
    importance
  - Limited use of distinctive matplotlib features beyond standard barh and colorbar
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing permutation
    feature importance for 13 wine-related features. Bars extend horizontally from
    a vertical reference line at x=0, with the highest importance feature (flavanoids,
    ~0.142) at the top and the lowest (ash, ~-0.002) at the bottom. The bars use a
    sequential Blues color gradient mapped to importance values - darker blue for
    higher importance, lighter for lower. Each bar includes horizontal error bars
    (gray caps) showing standard deviation. The colorbar on the right indicates the
    importance scale (0.00-0.14). Title follows the correct format. X-axis shows "Mean
    Decrease in Accuracy" and Y-axis shows "Feature". Grid lines are subtle with dashed
    styling at alpha=0.3.
