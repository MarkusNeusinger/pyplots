review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent clade coloring with three distinct, colorblind-safe colors (blue, yellow,
    green) representing apes, monkeys, and prosimians
  - Clean, readable phylogenetic tree structure with proper proportional branch lengths
  - Well-formatted title following exact spec convention
  - Scale bar included for reference (0.05 units)
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny with correct evolutionary groupings
  - Clean code structure with pre-computed coordinates for clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the meaning of the three clade colors (blue=apes, yellow=monkeys,
    green=prosimians)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phylogenetic tree showing primate evolutionary
    relationships. The tree structure uses a rectangular cladogram layout with horizontal
    and vertical branches. Three distinct clade colors are used: blue (#306998) for
    apes, yellow (#FFD43B) for monkeys (Old World and New World), and green (#5A9C5A)
    for prosimians (Lemur, Tarsier, Galago). Species names are labeled at leaf nodes
    with circular markers. Human and Chimpanzee are at the top as closest relatives,
    followed by Gorilla, then Asian apes (Orangutan, Gibbon), then Old World monkeys
    (Rhesus Macaque, Baboon), New World monkeys (Capuchin, Spider Monkey), and prosimians
    (Lemur, Tarsier, Galago) at the bottom. The x-axis shows "Evolutionary Distance
    (substitutions per site)" ranging from 0.00 to 0.35. A scale bar labeled "0.05"
    appears at the bottom left. The title reads "Primate Evolution · tree-phylogenetic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The plot has a clean white background with subtle
    vertical grid lines.'
