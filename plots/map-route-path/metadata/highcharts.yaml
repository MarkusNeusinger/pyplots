review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of route path visualization with time-based color gradient
  - 'Proper use of Highmaps features: mapline for route segments, mappoint for markers,
    geographic projection'
  - Distinct start (green circle) and end (red square) markers as specified
  - Direction arrows along the path indicate travel direction
  - Realistic hiking trail scenario with appropriate Swiss Alps geography
  - Interactive HTML version with zoom/pan enabled
  - Good color accessibility with blue-to-red diverging palette
  weaknesses:
  - Color axis labels in legend are crowded and overlap with each other
  - Code uses raw JavaScript construction rather than the highcharts_core Python API
    (though this is necessary for Highmaps functionality)
  image_description: The plot displays a route path map showing an Alpine hiking trail
    through the Swiss Alps region. The map shows Switzerland as a gray basemap with
    the hiking route rendered as a colored line that transitions from dark blue (start)
    through light blue/white in the middle to orange/red (end), representing 6 hours
    of time progression. A green circular marker labeled "START" appears on the right
    side of the route, and a red square marker labeled "END" appears on the left side.
    Yellow circular waypoint markers are placed at regular intervals along the route.
    Blue triangular direction arrows indicate the travel direction (west). The legend
    in the top-right corner shows "Start (0 hrs)" and "End (6 hrs)" entries, plus
    a color gradient bar showing time progression from 0 to 6 hours. The title reads
    "map-route-path · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle describing the Alpine
    hiking trail scenario.
