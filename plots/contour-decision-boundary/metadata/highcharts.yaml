review:
  strengths:
  - 'Significant improvement from Attempt 1: axis tick labels are now visible and
    properly aligned'
  - 'Correct colorblind-safe Python color scheme (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Good marker differentiation with circles vs diamonds and dark outlines for visibility
  - Heatmap properly aligned with scatter coordinates using actual x,y values
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title (Feature X1) is missing - only tick labels visible
  - Training data legend showing class labels is not visible in the rendered image
  - Color axis legend (probability scale) on right side is too small to be easily
    readable
