review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to construct phylogenetic tree with proper branch
    structure
  - Colorblind-friendly palette for species markers
  - Correct tree topology representing known primate evolutionary relationships
  - Properly proportional branch lengths reflecting evolutionary distances
  - Clean title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Scale bar included to indicate evolutionary distance units
  weaknesses:
  - Species names appear only in the bottom legend instead of being positioned directly
    next to their leaf nodes on the tree, which is the standard convention for phylogenetic
    trees
  - The scale bar label is not clearly visible next to the scale bar line in the plot
    area
  - The print_labels approach for species names did not render labels at the tree
    tips as intended
