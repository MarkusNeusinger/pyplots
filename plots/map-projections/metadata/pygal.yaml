review:
  strengths:
  - Creative interpretation of map projections spec by showing how Mercator projection
    distorts areas based on latitude
  - Excellent use of pygal distinctive world map capabilities (pygal_maps_world)
  - Educational and scientifically meaningful data with accurate distortion factors
  - Clean four-category color scheme that clearly distinguishes distortion levels
  - Well-organized legend at bottom with descriptive category labels
  weaknesses:
  - Missing graticule (latitude/longitude grid lines) as specified in requirements
  - Does not show multiple projections side-by-side for comparison as the spec suggests
  - Title format should be just spec-id library pyplots.ai without extra prefix
  - Legend category labels in code differ from what appears in rendered image
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map using pygal''s Robinson-like pseudo-cylindrical
    projection, showing Mercator projection distortion factors by country. The map
    uses a four-color scheme: red/pink shades for high latitude countries with extreme
    distortion (Greenland shown in bright red, Canada/Russia/Nordic countries in pink),
    light orange/peach for mid-latitude countries with high distortion (USA, UK, Argentina),
    pale yellow for moderate distortion (Germany, France, Australia, South Africa),
    and green for equatorial countries with minimal distortion (Brazil, Nigeria, DR
    Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia). The title reads "Mercator Projection Distortion
    · map-projections · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend at the bottom shows
    four categories: "Extreme (>2.5x)", "High (1.3-2.5x)", "Moderate (1.1-1.3x)",
    and "Minimal (<1.1x)". Country borders are clearly visible with gray outlines,
    and countries without data are shown in white/light gray.'
