review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the boxen plot concept with clear nested quantile
    boxes
  - Good use of color gradient to distinguish quantile levels
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all elements
  - Realistic data scenario with appropriate scale
  - Clean separation of categories with good spacing
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function compute_letter_values() violates KISS structure requirement
  - Legend order is counter-intuitive (should show quantiles in logical progression)
  image_description: The plot displays a boxen (letter-value) plot showing server
    response times across 4 API endpoints (API Auth, API Users, API Orders, API Search).
    Each endpoint shows nested rectangular boxes in a gradient of blue colors - ranging
    from lightest (#a8d4f0) for the median level to darkest (#0d3048) for the 64ths
    quantile level. The boxes decrease in width for deeper quantiles, creating a distinctive
    "stacked" appearance. A bright yellow/gold horizontal line marks the median within
    each boxen. Outliers are rendered as yellow/gold scattered points with jitter
    applied for visibility, appearing both above and below the main box structures.
    The y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to ~600ms, and the x-axis
    shows "API Endpoint" with the four category labels. A comprehensive legend on
    the right side explains each quantile level (Median Line, 64ths, 32nds, Sixteenths,
    Eighths, Fourths, Median 50%, and Outliers). The background is a subtle off-white
    (#fafafa) with dashed horizontal grid lines. The title correctly follows the format
    "boxen-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai".

        comment: Legend order is confusing - shows Median Line first, then 64ths-to-Median
          in reverse order, then Outliers. Quantile levels should be in intuitive
          order.

        comment: Response times 0-600ms are realistic for API calls. Some outlier
          values above 500ms are plausible but borderline high.
