review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and line/point visibility
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format and all required features
  - Realistic, comprehensible data scenario (monthly temperature with seasonal pattern)
  - Clean KISS code structure following project guidelines
  - Good use of layered chart (line + points) for enhanced visibility
  - Proper temporal encoding (:T) for datetime data
  weaknesses:
  - Missing Altair distinctive interactive features (tooltips, .interactive() for
    zoom/pan) that showcase the library strengths
  - Grid lines are too subtle (gridOpacity=0.3) making them barely visible
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic line chart showing monthly temperature
    data over a full year (January to December 2024). The line is blue (#306998) connecting
    12 data points, with filled circular markers at each point. The chart has a white
    background with subtle gray grid lines. The title "line-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center in black text. The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging
    from 0 to 34, and the X-axis shows "Month" with date labels (Jan 07, Feb 04, etc.).
    The trend shows a clear seasonal pattern: cold temperatures (~4°C) in winter months,
    rising through spring, peaking around 30°C in late June, then declining through
    autumn back to cold winter temperatures (~3.5°C in December).'
