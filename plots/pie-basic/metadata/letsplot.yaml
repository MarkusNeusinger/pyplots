review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of letsplot-specific geom_pie with layer_labels() chaining — a distinctive
    library feature not easily replicated elsewhere
  - Subtitle provides genuine data storytelling, highlighting the smallest named brand
    and the dominance of Others
  - White spacers between slices and exploded OPPO slice create visual hierarchy and
    emphasis
  - Clean, deterministic data using a realistic smartphone market share scenario
  - All font sizes explicitly set with appropriate values for the 3600x3600 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout imbalance: substantial whitespace below the pie chart before the legend,
    the bottom third of the canvas feels empty'
  - Color palette is reasonable but not a recognized colorblind-safe palette; green
    and grey may be hard to distinguish for some users
  - The explosion gap on the OPPO slice (0.12) creates a slightly large disconnection
    from the main pie
  - The many noqa inline comments add visual noise to the code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "Global Smartphone Market
    Share · pie-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" on a square white canvas (3600x3600
    px). Five slices represent smartphone brands: Apple (23.1%, dark blue/Python Blue),
    Samsung (19.4%, gold/yellow), Xiaomi (13.7%, green), OPPO (8.8%, purple, exploded
    outward from the pie), and Others (35.0%, grey). Each slice is labeled with its
    percentage value in white text. White spacers separate the slices cleanly. A subtitle
    reads "OPPO''s 8.8% slice is the smallest — ''Others'' dominate at 35%". A horizontal
    legend at the bottom shows "Brand" with colored circle markers for each company.
    The pie sits in the upper-center portion of the canvas with noticeable whitespace
    below it before the legend.'
