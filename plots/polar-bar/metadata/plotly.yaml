review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent wind rose visualization with properly stacked bars for three wind speed
    categories
  - Clean polar layout with N correctly positioned at top using rotation=90 and clockwise
    direction
  - Good color scheme with white bar separators enhancing readability
  - Proper use of Plotly Barpolar trace for polar bar charts
  - Realistic coastal wind pattern data with believable directional distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis tick labels are slightly small and angled, could be larger for better
    legibility
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive features like custom hover templates
  - Legend text could benefit from slightly better styling to match overall polish
  image_description: 'The plot shows a polar bar chart (wind rose) with 8 compass
    directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) arranged clockwise with N at the top.
    Three stacked bar categories represent wind speed ranges: Light (0-10 km/h) in
    dark blue (#306998), Moderate (10-20 km/h) in yellow (#FFD43B), and Strong (20+
    km/h) in teal/cyan (#4ECDC4). The bars radiate outward from the center, with W
    and SW showing the highest wind frequencies. The plot has concentric circular
    grid lines with radial axis labels showing "Frequency (%)" ranging from 5 to 35.
    A legend in the upper right shows the three wind speed categories. The title "polar-bar
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. White line separators between
    bars provide visual clarity. The overall layout is clean with good proportions.'
