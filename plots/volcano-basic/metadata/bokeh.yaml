review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of volcano plot with all required threshold lines and
    color coding
  - Well-scaled for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriately sized text and markers
  - Clean separation of data into three ColumnDataSources enables proper legend handling
  - Realistic simulated gene expression data with correlation between fold change
    magnitude and significance
  - Proper use of alpha transparency for dense data visualization
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Red/blue color scheme not optimal for colorblind accessibility - consider using
    colorblind-safe palette
  - 'Missing optional feature: labeling of top significant genes by name as suggested
    in spec notes'
  - No hover tooltips to identify individual points - a key Bokeh interactive feature
