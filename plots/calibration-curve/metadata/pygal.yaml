review:
  strengths:
  - Clean comparison of well-calibrated vs overconfident model demonstrating key calibration
    concepts
  - Brier scores integrated into legend labels for quantitative assessment
  - Perfect calibration diagonal reference line properly implemented with dashing
  - Appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of color coding to distinguish models
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at top-left rather than bottom as configured (legend_at_bottom=True
    not taking effect)
  - Yellow color for well-calibrated model has lower contrast on white background
  - Does not leverage pygal's distinctive SVG/interactive features like tooltips
