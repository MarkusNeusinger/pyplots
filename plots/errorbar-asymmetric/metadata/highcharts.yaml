review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native errorbar series type with proper caps/whiskers
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow Python colors)
  - Good realistic financial forecasting scenario with appropriate asymmetry
  - Proper inclusion of highcharts-more.js for errorbar support
  - Clear legend explaining what the asymmetric bounds represent (10th-90th percentile)
  - Subtitle provides context for the confidence interval interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Library version shows as "unknown" in the header comment (minor metadata issue)
