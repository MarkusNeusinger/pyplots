review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world technology data that is immediately recognizable and plausible
  - Colorblind-safe palette with redundant marker shape encoding per sector
  - Subtle pastel ring fills create effective visual separation of time horizons
  - Clean 270-degree arc layout with well-positioned ring labels in the gap
  - Deterministic positioning algorithm with smart within-sector/ring spreading
  weaknesses:
  - Multiple label overlaps (at least 4-5 pairs) — item labels at 8pt are too small
    and overlap in crowded ring-sector areas; needs larger font and better collision
    avoidance or radial label placement
  - Figure size 14x14 inches at 300dpi produces 4200x4200px, not matching either standard
    format (3600x3600 or 4800x2700)
  - No visual hierarchy among items — all markers are the same size regardless of
    importance; consider varying marker size or adding emphasis to key items
  - Sector divider lines and ring arcs could use slightly more contrast for the arc
    boundary to be visible at a glance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a technology radar chart rendered in polar
    coordinates using a 270-degree arc layout. Four concentric rings labeled Adopt
    (innermost), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost) are filled with subtle pastel
    colors: light blue (Adopt), light green (Trial), light yellow (Assess), and light
    pink (Hold). The arc is divided into four angular sectors labeled along the outer
    edge in bold: AI & ML (upper-left), Cloud & Infra (lower-left), Data Engineering
    (lower-right), and Security (upper-right). Each sector uses a distinct marker
    shape and color — blue circles for AI & ML, orange squares for Cloud & Infra,
    teal/green diamonds for Data Engineering, and pink triangles for Security. 22
    technology items are plotted as labeled markers within their respective ring/sector
    intersections. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold) appear in bold italic
    gray text in the gap at the right side of the arc. A legend in the lower-right
    corner maps each sector color/marker shape. The title reads "Technology Radar
    2026 · radar-innovation-timeline · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top in a large
    font. Several item labels overlap with neighboring labels or markers, particularly
    in crowded areas (e.g., "Vision Transformers" / "AI Code Assistants", "AI Threat
    Detection" / "Confidential Computing", "Edge Computing" / "Platform Engineering").'

        comment: Title 22pt, sector labels 16pt, ring labels 14pt are good. Item labels
