review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with properly sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic educational data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that is immediately
    relatable
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility via seed
  - Good use of hovertemplate for interactive tooltips
  - Appropriate marker transparency (0.7) for showing overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha is 0.1 which is quite faint - could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3
    recommended)
  - Does not fully leverage Plotly distinctive interactive features beyond basic hover
  - Data could include a few more obvious outliers to better demonstrate scatter plot
    use cases
