review:
  strengths:
  - Title format now correctly follows the specification (horizon-basic · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai)
  - Added subtle dashed vertical grid lines improving time-series readability across
    all series
  - Excellent implementation of custom chart type extending pygal Graph class for
    SVG rendering
  - Colorblind-safe blue-orange diverging color scheme with clear 3-band gradients
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with 6 metrics over 24 hours at 15-minute
    intervals
  - Clean row separation with borders and background colors for visual distinction
  weaknesses:
  - Class-based structure is necessary for this custom chart type but technically
    violates KISS (unavoidable trade-off)
  - X-axis label Time could include units (e.g., Time HH:MM) for full compliance
  image_description: The horizon chart displays 6 server metrics (CPU Usage, Memory,
    Network I/O, Disk I/O, Response Time, Error Rate) over a 24-hour period from 00:00
    to 22:00. Each metric occupies a horizontal band with time on the x-axis. Blue
    colors (light to dark gradients in 3 bands) represent positive deviations, while
    orange colors (light to dark gradients in 3 bands) represent negative deviations.
    The chart title "horizon-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend
    in the top-right shows positive (blues) and negative (oranges) color bands. Series
    labels appear on the left side, x-axis time labels at the bottom with "Time" as
    the axis title. Subtle dashed vertical grid lines help track time across all series.
    Each row has a light gray background with subtle borders separating the series.
