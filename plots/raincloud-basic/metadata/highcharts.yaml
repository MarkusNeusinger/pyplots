review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with four distinct distributions (normal, shifted, bimodal,
    high-variance) showcasing the power of raincloud plots
  - Proper three-component raincloud structure with half-violin, box plot, and jittered
    scatter
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between categories
  - Realistic reaction time data context with appropriate scales
  - Clean layout with good canvas utilization
  weaknesses:
  - Half-violin density curves are rendered as thin lines instead of filled area polygons,
    reducing visual impact of the cloud
  - Legend contains 6 separate entries instead of a cleaner grouped legend
  - Uses a helper function compute_kde_simple() instead of inline code per KISS principles
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python API as documented in library rules, instead
    builds raw JavaScript
