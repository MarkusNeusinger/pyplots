review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with two targeted callout annotations and a contextual
    subtitle providing market size
  - All text sizes explicitly and generously set for the 3600x3600 canvas — highly
    readable
  - Colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary, good visual hierarchy
  - Clean idiomatic Bokeh code using ColumnDataSource and proper Legend construction
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh's web-native strengths
  - Exploded largest slice draws immediate attention to AWS as market leader
  weaknesses:
  - Minor excess whitespace above the pie chart between title and chart top could
    be reduced
  - The subtitle text at the bottom is relatively small (22pt) compared to other elements
    and may not draw enough attention
  - Alibaba slice (4%) is quite thin — could benefit from slightly larger explode
    or callout
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "pie-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    showing cloud infrastructure market share (2024) with five slices: AWS (33%, dark
    navy blue, slightly exploded outward for emphasis), Azure (23%, golden yellow),
    Google Cloud (11%, purple), Alibaba (4%, orange), and Others (29%, teal blue).
    Each slice has a bold percentage label centered within it — white text on dark
    backgrounds, dark text on the yellow slice. Two callout annotations appear: "▲
    Market Leader" in blue near the AWS slice and "Long-tail rivals ≈ Azure" in gray
    italic near the Others slice. A subtitle at the bottom reads "Top 4 providers
    control 71% of the $280B global cloud market". A horizontal legend at the bottom
    lists all five categories with their percentages. The background is a subtle off-white
    (#FAFBFC). White separator lines clearly delineate each wedge.'
