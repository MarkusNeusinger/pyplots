review:
  strengths:
  - Clean 4x4 matrix layout with histograms on diagonal and scatter plots off-diagonal
  - Accessible color palette (blue, orange, teal) works well for colorblindness
  - Proper axis labels with units (cm) on edge plots only
  - Uses ggbunch effectively for complex multi-plot layout
  - Tooltips provide some interactivity on scatter points
  - Honest documentation of library limitations in header comment
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text truncated (Virgi instead of Virginica)
  - Cannot implement core spec requirement of linked brushing/selection (lets-plot
    limitation)
  - Text sizes could be larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Title uses period dots instead of middle dots in the title format
  image_description: The plot displays a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) for iris-like
    synthetic data with three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). The main title
    "scatter-matrix-interactive · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    diagonal cells show overlapping histograms colored by species (blue for Setosa,
    orange for Versicolor, teal/green for Virginica). Off-diagonal cells show scatter
    plots of variable pairs with the same color encoding. Axes are labeled with units
    (cm) for Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. X-axis labels
    appear on the bottom row, Y-axis labels on the left column. A legend appears at
    the bottom left showing the three species. The layout uses a square 1:1 aspect
    ratio with good utilization of the canvas.
