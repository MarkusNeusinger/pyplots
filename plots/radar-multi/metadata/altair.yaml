review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using Altair layered approach with manual
    polar-to-cartesian coordinate transformation
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/green)
  - Proper polygon closure by adding first point at end
  - Good use of Altair declarative features including tooltips, custom scales, and
    legend configuration
  - Clean hexagonal gridlines that match the 6-axis structure
  - Square canvas (1:1 aspect ratio) is appropriate for radar charts
  weaknesses:
  - Grid value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) only appear on one spoke; could be clearer
    if they were more prominent or on a dedicated axis
  - The filled polygons use mark_line with filled=True which may not render as proper
    filled areas in all renderers - consider using mark_area or geoshape for more
    reliable polygon fills
