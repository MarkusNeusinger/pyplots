review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn JointGrid to create marginal histograms alongside the
    2D heatmap
  - Viridis colormap is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended in
    spec
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Colorbar properly labeled with Count for density interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or more descriptive names
  - Layout could be slightly improved - the right marginal histogram appears somewhat
    cramped relative to the main plot
