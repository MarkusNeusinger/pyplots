review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data with 24 real-world technology names mapped to plausible
    ThoughtWorks-style radar categories
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/amber/teal/purple) with good visual separation between
    sectors
  - Clever slot-based angular layout that evenly distributes items within each sector
  - Clean well-structured code with deterministic data and idiomatic pygal usage
  - Dual PNG+HTML output leverages pygal SVG-native tooltip capability for the HTML
    version
  - Custom Style with intentional font sizing opacity and visual hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - Individual innovation names are completely invisible in the static PNG output
    — they only exist as SVG tooltips which is a significant gap for the core spec
    requirement of labeled items
  - Filled polygons connecting adjacent dots across different rings create a misleading
    visual shape rather than clearly showing discrete item placements
  - Ring labels (Adopt/Trial/Assess/Hold) appear only on one spoke making the time-horizon
    hierarchy less immediately scannable
  - Some visual congestion near the center where all sectors converge
  image_description: 'The plot shows a pygal radar chart on a 3600x3600 square canvas
    with a white background and light gray (#f4f5fa) plot area. Four concentric dashed
    rings represent time-horizon levels labeled "Adopt" (innermost), "Trial", "Assess",
    and "Hold" (outermost) along the upper-left spoke. Four sector headers are positioned
    at the cardinal points: "AI & ML" (top), "Cloud & Infra" (left), "Sustainability"
    (bottom), and "Biotech & Health" (right). Each sector''s data points are connected
    as filled semi-transparent polygons — blue for AI & ML (upper-left quadrant),
    amber/orange for Cloud & Infra (lower-left), teal for Sustainability (lower-right),
    and purple for Biotech & Health (upper-right). Individual data points appear as
    colored dots (size 16) at their respective angular slots and radial ring positions.
    The title "radar-innovation-timeline · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    A bottom legend displays all four category names with colored squares. Notably,
    individual innovation names (e.g., "LLM Agents", "Kubernetes") are NOT visible
    on the static PNG — they exist only as SVG tooltips.'
