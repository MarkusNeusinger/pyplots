review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic department/experience level scenario
    showing meaningful variation
  - Proper use of seaborn hue parameter for grouping with custom color palette
  - Good visual hierarchy with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean separation of boxes within each category with consistent widths
  - Outliers are clearly visible and add to the data story
  weaknesses:
  - 'The two blue colors (Junior #306998 and Senior #4B8BBE) are somewhat similar
    and could be more distinct for colorblind accessibility'
  - Axis labels lack units (though Performance Score is inherently unitless, could
    add 0-100 for clarity)
