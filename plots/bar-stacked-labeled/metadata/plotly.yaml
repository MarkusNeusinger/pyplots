review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the stacked bar chart with clear total labels above
    each bar
  - Segment labels inside bars enhance readability without cluttering
  - Clean, professional appearance using plotly_white template
  - Good use of annotations for total labels with bold formatting
  - Appropriate color palette with good contrast
  - Proper output in both PNG and HTML formats
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order appears reversed from visual stacking order (top-to-bottom in legend
    vs bottom-to-top in bars)
  - Could benefit from custom hover tooltips showing percentage contributions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    by product category (Software, Hardware, Services, Maintenance) across 5 quarters
    (Q1 2024 through Q1 2025). Each bar is composed of 4 colored segments: dark blue
    (Software) at the bottom, yellow/gold (Hardware), teal/cyan (Services), and coral/salmon
    (Maintenance) at the top. Each segment has a white text label showing its value
    (e.g., "$180K", "$120K"). Bold black total labels appear above each bar stack
    ("$430K", "$445K", "$462K", "$540K", "$550K"). The title "bar-stacked-labeled
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A horizontal legend appears below
    the title with all 4 product categories. The y-axis shows "Revenue ($ thousands)"
    ranging from 0 to 600, and the x-axis shows "Quarter". The plot uses the plotly_white
    template with subtle grid lines. The overall visual is clean, professional, and
    easy to read.'

          Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like hover customization
