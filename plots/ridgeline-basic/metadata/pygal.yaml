review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ridgeline plot using pygal XY chart with filled polygons
  - Beautiful seasonal color gradient that intuitively conveys temperature patterns
  - Proper KDE computation implemented inline without functions, maintaining KISS
    principle
  - Good overlap between ridges (~60%) creating characteristic mountain-ridge appearance
  - Clean month labels on Y-axis as specified, positioned at ridge baselines
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical grid lines slightly prominent; could use lower alpha for subtler appearance
  - Does not leverage distinctive pygal features like built-in interactivity or tooltips
