review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native Waterfall trace with measure types (absolute, relative,
    total)
  - Clean connector lines with dotted styling emphasize cumulative flow
  - 'Proper color differentiation: blue for totals, red for decreases, green for increases'
  - Value labels positioned outside bars with clear dollar formatting
  - Realistic financial scenario with appropriate data values
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    using blue/orange palette)
  - Could add a simple legend explaining the color meanings for clarity
  image_description: The plot displays a waterfall chart showing a quarterly financial
    breakdown from Revenue ($500,000) to Net Income ($153,750). Blue bars represent
    totals (Revenue and Net Income), red bars show decreases (Product Costs, Operating
    Expenses, Marketing, Taxes), and a green bar shows an increase (Other Income).
    Dotted gray connector lines link consecutive bars to emphasize the cumulative
    flow. Value labels appear outside each bar with dollar formatting. The Y-axis
    shows "Amount ($)" with proper currency tick formatting, and the X-axis shows
    "Category". The title follows the required format centered at the top.
