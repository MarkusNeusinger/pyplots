review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including jittered
    data points, sigmoid curve, confidence interval, and decision threshold
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features like ColumnDataSource, Span, and Label annotations
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with proper font scaling
  - Colorblind-accessible color scheme with blue and yellow
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic educational scenario with test scores
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in bottom-right corner overlaps slightly with Class 0 data points
    at high test scores
  - Output path saves to script directory instead of working directory (minor issue
    for workflow)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a logistic regression visualization with the
    characteristic S-shaped sigmoid curve. Blue markers (Class 0 - Failed) are jittered
    around y=0 at the bottom, while yellow/gold markers (Class 1 - Passed) are jittered
    around y=1 at the top. The smooth blue logistic curve runs through the middle,
    showing the predicted probability transition from low to high. A light blue shaded
    band represents the 95% confidence interval around the curve. A red dashed horizontal
    line at p=0.5 indicates the decision threshold, labeled "Decision Threshold (p=0.5)".
    The x-axis shows "Test Score" ranging from roughly 15 to 85, and the y-axis shows
    "Probability of Passing" from 0 to 1. Model accuracy (88.5%) is annotated in the
    upper left. The legend in the bottom right identifies all elements: 95% CI, Logistic
    Curve, Class 0 (Failed), and Class 1 (Passed). The title follows the correct format
    "logistic-regression · bokeh · pyplots.ai".'
