review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of phase space dynamics with clear spiral trajectories
    converging to equilibrium
  - Well-chosen physics example (damped harmonic oscillator) that perfectly demonstrates
    the plot type
  - Starting points clearly marked with large scatter markers distinguishing each
    trajectory
  - Direction arrows effectively show time evolution along the trajectories
  - Reference lines (dashed gray at x=0 and y=0) help identify equilibrium crossing
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with hue for trajectory differentiation
  - Clean readable code with analytical solution for underdamped oscillator
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning and styling could be improved - the Equilibrium marker is added
    separately and its legend entry appears disconnected
  - Inner portions of spirals become dense and harder to distinguish near the origin
  - Could benefit from using a colorblind-friendly palette instead of custom colors
