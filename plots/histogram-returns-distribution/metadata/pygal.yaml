review:
  strengths:
  - Statistics displayed in title (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) - good approach
    for pygal
  - Tail regions beyond 2σ highlighted with distinct color (red vs blue)
  - Proper density normalization applied
  - Clean, readable code structure with good comments
  - Creative use of XY chart to simulate histogram bars
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Normal distribution curve overlay is not visible in the rendered output
    - the code adds it but it does not appear in the image'
  - X-axis tick labels are rotated and slightly hard to read
  - Legend placement causes slight overlap with x-axis title
  - Title format includes statistics but places spec-id format at the end rather than
    as the main title
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns distribution
    using pygal''s bar chart approach. The main histogram bars are rendered in blue
    (#306998) for returns within 2 standard deviations, while tail regions beyond
    ±2σ are shown in red/coral (#E74C3C). The title at the top includes key statistics:
    "Daily Returns Distribution (Mean: 0.044% | Std: 1.451% | Skew: 0.30 | Kurt: 0.62)
    · histogram-returns-distribution · pygal · pyplots.ai". The x-axis shows "Returns
    (%)" with tick labels at intervals (approximately -3.72, -2.19, -0.48, 1.14, 2.75,
    4.37), though these appear rotated and somewhat hard to read. The y-axis displays
    "Frequency (Density × 100)". A legend at the bottom shows "Returns" and "Tails
    (>2σ)". The histogram displays a roughly bell-shaped distribution with the peak
    around 0%. Critically, the normal distribution curve overlay is NOT visible -
    this is a major spec requirement that appears to be missing from the rendered
    output. The code includes a "Normal Distribution" series but it does not render
    visibly in the final image.'
