review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the decision boundary using geom_tile for filled
    regions
  - Clear distinction between correctly and incorrectly classified points using shape
    encoding
  - Appropriate use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with proper layering (background
    regions + foreground points)
  - 'Good color scheme with Python colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that is colorblind-accessible'
  - 'Comprehensive legend system showing all three aspects: predicted class, true
    class, and classification accuracy'
  weaknesses:
  - Three separate legends consume significant horizontal space; could potentially
    be consolidated
  - Axis labels lack meaningful domain context (just Feature X1/X2 since using synthetic
    data)
