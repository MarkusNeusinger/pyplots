review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including optional capital market
    line
  - Color coding portfolios by Sharpe ratio terciles adds meaningful information
  - Proper use of z_index to ensure important elements render on top
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette
  - Clear distinction between frontier curve (thick cyan), CML (dashed green), and
    scatter points
  - Proper use of scipy optimization for generating true efficient frontier
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (portfolio_stats, min_variance_for_return) instead
    of inline code, violating KISS structure requirement
  - Legend placed far to the right creates visual imbalance
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio optimization on a white background. The X-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation %)" ranging from 0 to 50, and the Y-axis shows "Expected Return (%)" ranging from 1 to 26. The title reads "frontier-efficient · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Efficient Frontier with Simulated Portfolios".

    The visualization includes:
    - Scatter points in three colors representing Sharpe ratio categories: brown (Low Sharpe Ratio), yellow (Medium Sharpe Ratio), and blue (High Sharpe Ratio) - approximately 300 portfolios clustered between 13-28% risk and 8-15% return
    - Cyan efficient frontier curve - a thick solid line showing the optimal portfolio boundary, starting around (13%, 8%) and curving up to approximately (47%, 18%)
    - Green dashed Capital Market Line - extending from the risk-free rate (0%, 3%) through the tangency portfolio and beyond
    - Purple square marker indicating the Minimum Variance portfolio (~14% risk, ~10% return)
    - Pink triangle marker indicating the Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio (~16% risk, ~12% return)
    - A legend on the right side with all series clearly labeled
