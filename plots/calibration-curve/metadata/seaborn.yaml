review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curves comparing three different classifiers
    with distinct calibration behaviors
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot and histplot functions with the whitegrid theme
  - 'Includes all spec requirements: diagonal reference line, 10 bins, Brier scores,
    histogram subplot, and multi-model comparison'
  - Good color choices with Python Blue and Yellow plus a distinguishable brown
  - Well-sized markers and line widths make the curves easy to follow
  - Title follows the exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram legend in the right panel overlaps slightly with the histogram bars
    at the top
  - The brown color for underconfident model could be more distinct from the yellow
    overconfident model
  - Could use seaborn built-in statistical features more extensively such as confidence
    bands
  image_description: 'The plot displays a two-panel figure. The left panel shows calibration
    curves for three classifiers: Well-Calibrated (blue circles, Brier: 0.128), Overconfident
    (yellow/gold squares, Brier: 0.124), and Underconfident (brown triangles, Brier:
    0.191), plotted against a dashed diagonal reference line representing perfect
    calibration. The x-axis is "Mean Predicted Probability" (0-1) and y-axis is "Fraction
    of Positives" (0-1). The title correctly reads "calibration-curve · seaborn ·
    pyplots.ai". The right panel shows overlapping histograms of prediction distributions
    for all three classifiers, with "Predicted Probability" on x-axis and "Count"
    on y-axis. Colors are Python Blue (#306998), Python Yellow (#FFD43B), and a brown/sienna
    color (#8B4513). The whitegrid style from seaborn is applied throughout.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme, sns.lineplot, sns.histplot appropriately, but
          could leverage more seaborn-specific statistical features like confidence
          intervals
  verdict: APPROVED
