review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart grid with mathematically correct constant
    resistance circles and reactance arcs
  - Realistic antenna impedance data that traverses both inductive and capacitive
    regions
  - Interactive tooltips (layer_tooltips) showing frequency, impedance, and VSWR on
    hover - great use of lets-plot feature
  - Clear visual distinction between start (green) and end (red) markers with manual
    legend
  - Proper normalization of impedance to reference impedance (Z0=50 ohms) and conversion
    to reflection coefficient
  weaknesses:
  - 'Unused import: LetsPlot is imported but the symbol is only used for setup_html()
    call'
  - Missing grid labels for resistance and reactance values (r=0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2,
    5) on the chart
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart with the characteristic circular
    grid pattern used in RF engineering. The chart features constant resistance circles
    (blue lines centered along the horizontal axis) and constant reactance arcs (blue
    curves emanating from the right edge). A yellow impedance locus curve traces the
    frequency sweep trajectory from 1.0 GHz (green start marker on the left) to 6.0
    GHz (red end marker near the center-right). The trajectory traverses both the
    upper (inductive) and lower (capacitive) halves of the chart, demonstrating realistic
    antenna impedance behavior. Frequency labels (1.0 GHz, 3.5 GHz, 6.0 GHz) annotate
    key points along the trajectory. A manual legend on the right side outside the
    chart shows "Start (1.0 GHz)" with a green marker and "End (6.0 GHz)" with a red
    marker. The outer boundary circle (|gamma| = 1) is drawn in dark gray, and the
    horizontal real axis passes through the center. The title "smith-chart-basic ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The chart uses a square aspect ratio
    with a white background via theme_void().
