review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar stacked histogram using Altair Cartesian coordinates
    with creative polygon-based arc wedges
  - Clean layered composition with proper z-ordering (grid → data → labels)
  - Colorblind-friendly color scale progressing from cool blue to warm orange
  - Interactive tooltips showing direction, speed range, and frequency percentage
  - Realistic Weibull-distributed wind speed data typical of meteorological patterns
  - Creative use of detail encoding for path grouping in wedge segments
  weaknesses:
  - The 25% frequency label overlaps with the NE compass direction label - adjust
    positioning to avoid text collision
  - The Frequency (%) radial axis title is not visible in the rendered output - ensure
    it renders clearly
