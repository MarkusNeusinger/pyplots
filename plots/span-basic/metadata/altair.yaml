review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical and horizontal span regions with appropriate
    visual styling
  - Clean layered composition using Altair declarative grammar (alt.layer())
  - Realistic recession period scenario makes the visualization immediately meaningful
  - Good use of semi-transparent fill (opacity 0.25, 0.2) as recommended by spec
  - Edge lines with dashed styling provide clear span boundaries
  - Text labels positioned within/near spans for context
  - Proper font sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700)
  weaknesses:
  - No legend/key explaining span colors (relies solely on in-chart labels)
  - Could leverage Altair interactive features (tooltips, zoom) for HTML output
  - Warning Zone label positioned at right edge - could be better centered in the
    span region
