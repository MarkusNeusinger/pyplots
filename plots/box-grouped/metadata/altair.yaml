review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's xOffset encoding for clean side-by-side grouping
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal) with good contrast
  - Comprehensive data generation showing realistic performance distributions with
    varied means, standard deviations, and intentional outliers
  - Proper customization of boxplot mark with white median lines and appropriately
    sized outliers
  - Clean declarative code structure following Altair best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned with default orient=right places it somewhat isolated from the
    plot area
  - Grid styling uses gridDash which works but default subtle grid might be cleaner
  - Could add tooltips for interactivity since Altair excels at this
