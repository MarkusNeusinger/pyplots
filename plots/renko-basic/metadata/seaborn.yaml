review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Renko chart algorithm with proper stair-step brick positioning
  - Good data generation showing realistic price movements with multiple trend reversals
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate brick sizing and gaps for visual clarity
  - Helpful annotation showing brick size
  weaknesses:
  - Title format uses hyphens instead of required middle dots (·)
  - 'Color mismatch: code defines colorblind-safe blue/orange but rendered image shows
    traditional red/green'
  - Seaborn is only used for styling - no seaborn plotting functions are utilized
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart showing stock price movements
    over approximately 40 bricks. Green bricks represent bullish (upward) price movements
    while red bricks represent bearish (downward) movements. The chart shows a clear
    pattern: an initial rise from ~$100 to ~$105, followed by a significant decline
    to ~$87, then a recovery back up to ~$112. Bricks are uniform in size ($2 each
    as noted in the annotation), clearly separated with small gaps, and properly stair-stepped.
    The Y-axis shows "Stock Price (USD)" ranging from ~$85 to ~$112, and the X-axis
    shows "Brick Number" from 0 to ~40. A legend in the upper left identifies the
    brick colors. An annotation in the lower right displays "Brick Size: $2". The
    title reads "renko-basic - seaborn - pyplots.ai" using hyphens instead of middle
    dots.'

        comment: Seaborn is only used for styling (set_style, set_context). All plotting
          is done with matplotlib patches. No seaborn plotting functions are used.
