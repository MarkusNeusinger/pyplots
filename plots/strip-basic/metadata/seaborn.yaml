review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of modern seaborn API with hue parameter to avoid FutureWarning
  - Good implementation of jitter (0.25) matching spec recommendation (0.1-0.3)
  - Thoughtful addition of group mean lines as reference (spec suggestion implemented)
  - Varied distributions across departments demonstrate strip plot utility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Color palette includes two similar blue shades (Engineering #306998, Sales #4B8BBE)
    which may be hard to distinguish'
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Satisfaction Score (%) or Satisfaction Score (0-100))
