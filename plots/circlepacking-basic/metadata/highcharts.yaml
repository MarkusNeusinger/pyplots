review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Title follows the correct format specification
  - Realistic data scenario (software project structure by lines of code)
  - Interactive HTML output with drilldown capability
  - Good hierarchical data structure with proper parent-child relationships
  weaknesses:
  - 'WRONG CHART TYPE: Implementation uses sunburst chart instead of circle packing
    chart - this is a fundamental specification violation'
  - Circle packing requires nested circles inside parent circles; sunburst uses radial
    arc segments
  - Highcharts has a dedicated packedbubble chart type that could be adapted, or circles
    could be drawn manually
  - The spec explicitly states nested circles and pack circles efficiently - neither
    is achieved
