review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent code quality following KISS principles with clean structure
  - Realistic, well-researched data (Pacific Northwest rainfall pattern with appropriate
    seasonal variation)
  - Proper acknowledgment in code comments that pygal lacks native rose chart support
  - Good color choice and styling with Python blue
  - Correct title format and appropriate canvas sizing for circular chart
  weaknesses:
  - 'Wrong chart type: Implementation creates a radar/spider chart (polygon connecting
    points) instead of a rose/coxcomb chart (wedge-shaped segments with equal angles
    and radii proportional to values)'
  - 'Layout issues: Legend isolated in bottom-left corner with excessive whitespace
    around the chart'
  - Month labels arranged counter-clockwise which is unconventional for time-based
    data
