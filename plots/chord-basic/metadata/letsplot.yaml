review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chord diagram construction using geom_polygon with smooth Bezier curves
  - Clean implementation building polygons mathematically for both arcs and chords
  - Perfect square format (1200x1200 base, scaled 3x) for circular visualization
  - Realistic migration flow data with bidirectional flows between 6 continents
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.55) for chord overlap visibility
  - Well-positioned labels outside the ring with bold formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Title format could better follow the spec-id pattern (title text after the standard
    format)
  - Chord colors only show source color; adding gradient or target indication would
    improve bidirectional flow clarity
