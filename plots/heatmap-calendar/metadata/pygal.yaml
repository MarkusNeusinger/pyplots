review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style visual design with authentic green color palette
  - Well-implemented custom CalendarHeatmap class extending pygal Graph
  - Dynamic legend with numeric value ranges based on actual data
  - Comprehensive summary statistics (total contributions, active days, longest streak,
    average)
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Realistic GitHub contribution simulation with weekday patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Legend value ranges have overlapping boundaries (4-7 and 7-10 both include 7)
  - Code uses class/functions which violates KISS principle (though necessary for
    pygal custom chart)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a GitHub-style calendar heatmap for the year
    2024. The title "heatmap-calendar · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The calendar grid shows 12 months (Jan-Dec) labeled along the top, with weekday
    labels (Mon-Sun) on the left side. Each day is represented as a small rounded
    rectangle cell. The color scheme uses GitHub''s signature green palette: light
    gray (#ebedf0) for no activity, progressing through increasingly darker greens
    (#9be9a8, #40c463, #30a14e, #216e39) for higher values. Below the grid is a color
    legend showing "Less" to "More" with numeric ranges (0, 1-4, 4-7, 7-10, 10+).
    Summary statistics at the bottom show "286 contributions in 366 days", "111 active
    days · Longest streak: 3 days · Avg: 2.6 per active day". The layout is well-balanced
    with the calendar grid taking appropriate space.'
