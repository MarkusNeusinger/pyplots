review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and clear color contrast
  - Realistic temperature forecast scenario that demonstrates the plot type perfectly
  - Widening confidence interval over time shows thoughtful data modeling
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles
  - Proper use of toself fill for creating the confidence band polygon
  - Good use of semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.25) as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper-left overlaps slightly with the confidence band at its peak
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates to show exact
    values on mouseover
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing monthly temperature data
    over 50 months. A dark blue solid line represents the mean temperature, oscillating
    between approximately 7°C and 25°C with clear seasonal periodicity (annual cycles).
    The line is surrounded by a light blue semi-transparent shaded band representing
    the 95% confidence interval. The confidence band widens slightly over time, demonstrating
    increasing uncertainty. The title "line-confidence · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Month" (ranging 0-50), and the y-axis is labeled
    "Temperature (°C)" (ranging 0-30). A legend in the upper-left corner identifies
    "95% Confidence Interval" and "Mean Temperature". Grid lines are subtle gray.
    The overall layout is clean with a white background.
