review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine native patchwork-style composition operators (| and
    /) for grid layout
  - Clean implementation of 4 distinct plot types demonstrating subplot-grid versatility
  - Good color scheme with consistent blue-yellow palette across all subplots
  - Proper use of theme customization with shared base_theme for consistency
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with coherent metrics
  weaknesses:
  - Main title positioning overlaps slightly with Sales Trend subplot title - could
    benefit from more vertical spacing
  - The legend in the sales trend plot consumes plot area; consider positioning outside
