review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using Altair layered approach with manual
    polar-to-cartesian coordinate transformation
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/green)
  - Proper polygon closure by adding first point at end
  - Good use of Altair declarative features including tooltips, custom scales, and
    legend configuration
  - Clean hexagonal gridlines that match the 6-axis structure
  - Square canvas (1:1 aspect ratio) is appropriate for radar charts
  weaknesses:
  - Grid value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) only appear on one spoke; could be clearer
    if they were more prominent or on a dedicated axis
  - The filled polygons use mark_line with filled=True which may not render as proper
    filled areas in all renderers - consider using mark_area or geoshape for more
    reliable polygon fills
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart comparing three
    products (A, B, C) across six dimensions: Price, Quality, Durability, Support,
    Features, and Design. The chart uses a hexagonal grid structure with concentric
    gridlines at intervals of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. Product A is rendered in Python
    blue (#306998), Product B in yellow (#FFD43B), and Product C in green (#4CAF50).
    Each series is shown as a filled polygon with ~20% opacity and solid colored outlines
    with circular markers at each vertex. The legend is positioned in the top-right
    corner with a bordered box. Axis labels are bold and positioned outside the outermost
    gridline. Grid value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) appear along the vertical spoke.
    The title "radar-multi · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.'

        comment: Data is deterministic (hardcoded), but no np.random.seed needed since
          no random data used; however the code imports numpy but only uses it for

        comment: Excellent use of Altair's declarative layering system, proper use
          of mark_line with filled=True for polygon fills, tooltips for interactivity,
          alt.Scale for custom color domains, proper encoding types (Q, N), HTML export
          for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
