review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layered construction
  - Well-designed data generation with realistic variation across departments and
    experience levels
  - Good use of position_dodge2 for clean grouped box arrangement
  - Appropriate outlier handling with clear visibility
  - Clean theme customization with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Categorical ordering ensures consistent experience level display order
  weaknesses:
  - The two blue colors (Junior and Senior) are somewhat similar; a more distinct
    palette would improve differentiation
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Performance Score (0-100))
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot showing employee performance
    scores across four departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support) on the
    x-axis, with Performance Score on the y-axis ranging from approximately 30 to
    120. Three experience levels (Junior, Mid-Level, Senior) are shown side-by-side
    within each department using distinct colors: dark blue (#306998) for Junior,
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Mid-Level, and light blue (#4B8BBE) for Senior. The boxes
    show medians, quartiles, and whiskers with outliers displayed as gray dots. The
    title "box-grouped · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The legend on
    the right identifies "Experience Level" with the three categories. The plot uses
    a minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.'
