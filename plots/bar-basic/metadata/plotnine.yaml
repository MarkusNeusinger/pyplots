review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured to spec requirements
  - 'Strong data storytelling: highlight color on leading bar + 38% ahead annotation
    + dollar-formatted value labels create a clear narrative'
  - Very idiomatic plotnine code with clean grammar of graphics layering
  - Realistic business context with plausible sales figures
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed unnecessary grid lines, subtle y-grid, no ticks,
    white background'
  - Perfect spec compliance across all criteria
  weaknesses:
  - The annotation text is positioned at y = top_val + 2800 which places it very close
    to the top of the chart area and cramped near the y-axis, creating a slightly
    unbalanced layout
  - Data values follow a strictly monotonic decrease which is somewhat predictable;
    introducing variation (e.g., two categories with similar values) would better
    demonstrate comparison capabilities
  - Could leverage more distinctive plotnine features to push library mastery higher
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" showing sales (USD) across 6 product categories sorted in descending
    order. The leading category (Electronics, $45,200) is highlighted in dark navy
    blue (#306998), while the remaining 5 bars (Clothing $32,800, Home & Garden $28,500,
    Sports $19,700, Books $15,300, Toys $12,400) use a lighter steel blue (#7BA7C9).
    Each bar has a dollar-formatted value label positioned just above it. An italic
    annotation in dark blue reads "▲ 38% ahead of 2nd place" near the top of the Electronics
    bar. The y-axis displays "$0K" through "$50K" with 10K increments, and the x-axis
    lists category names horizontally. The background is clean white with subtle horizontal
    gridlines (alpha=0.2). No vertical gridlines or axis ticks are shown. The layout
    is 16:9 landscape format.
