review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-chosen font sizes for all elements
  - 'Perfect implementation of spec requirements: diverging colormap, cell annotations,
    and colorbar'
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal patterns visible in the data
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotly library guidelines exactly
  - Good use of RdBu_r colormap which is colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., "Product Category" instead of just
    "Category")
  - Colorbar title could include more context (e.g., "Monthly Sales ($K)")
  - Could leverage additional Plotly features like custom hover templates for enhanced
    interactivity
