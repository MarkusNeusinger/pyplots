review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (:Q, :N)
  - Semi-transparent bars (opacity=0.5) allow clear visualization of overlapping regions
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good contrast between blue/yellow/green
  - Clean KISS structure with reproducible random seed
  - Tooltips enhance interactivity when viewed as HTML
  - Proper use of stack=None to achieve true overlapping rather than stacked bars
  - Grid styling is subtle and non-distracting with dashed lines
  weaknesses: []
