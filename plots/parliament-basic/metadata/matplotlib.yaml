review:
  strengths:
  - Clean semicircular layout algorithm with proper seat distribution across 8 concentric
    rows
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using established accessible colors
  - Party arrangement from left to right matches political convention
  - Individual seats clearly visible with white borders providing visual separation
  - Legend includes seat counts in parentheses for quick reference
  - Majority threshold annotation adds context without cluttering the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend ncol=3 creates uneven distribution (2-2-1 parties per row); ncol=2 or ncol=5
    would be more balanced
  - Party names still reference political spectrum (Progressive, Conservative) rather
    than completely neutral names like colors or regions
  - Could use matplotlib patches/collections for more efficient rendering of many
    similar shapes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    400 seats arranged in 8 concentric arcs. Five parties are represented using a
    colorblind-safe palette: Progressive Alliance (145 seats, orange/gold) on the
    far left, Liberty Union (110 seats, blue), Green Future (45 seats, green), Conservative
    Party (80 seats, red-orange), and Reform Movement (20 seats, pink) on the far
    right. Seats are rendered as individual dots with white edge borders. The title
    "parliament-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. Below
    the semicircle, italic text displays "Majority threshold: 201 seats". A 3-column
    legend at the bottom shows party names with seat counts. The chart has a clean
    white background with no axes visible.'
