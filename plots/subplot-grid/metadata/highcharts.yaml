review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a financial dashboard subplot grid with 4 distinct
    chart types
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Colorblind-safe color palette throughout (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Clean CSS grid layout for positioning the 4 charts
  - Realistic financial data scenario with meaningful relationships between price,
    volume, and returns
  - Moving average overlay on price chart demonstrates multi-series capability
  - Good use of Highcharts container system for multi-chart layout
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram x-axis labels (return percentages) are not visible in the rendered output
  - LineSeries imported from .area module instead of .line module (minor code issue)
  - Could benefit from synchronized tooltips across charts for better interactivity
  - Legend disabled on most charts where it could provide useful context
  image_description: The plot displays a 2x2 grid layout of financial dashboard visualizations.
    Top-left shows a "Stock Price Trend" with a solid blue line tracking price from
    ~$102 down to ~$77 over 60 trading days, accompanied by a yellow dashed 10-Day
    Moving Average. Top-right displays "Trading Volume" as blue vertical bars ranging
    from ~10k to ~130k shares. Bottom-left shows "Daily Returns Distribution" as a
    yellow histogram with frequency counts (0-8) across return percentages. Bottom-right
    presents "Price vs Volume Relationship" as a purple scatter plot. The main title
    "subplot-grid · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. All subplots
    have light gray borders and consistent styling.

          chart. However, most subplots disable legend when it could be useful.

        comment: Uses Highcharts grid container system, multiple chart instances,
          dash_style for MA line. Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features
          like synchronized tooltips across charts.
