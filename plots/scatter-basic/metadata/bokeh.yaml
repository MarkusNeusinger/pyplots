review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh distinctive features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with
    formatted tooltips, and dual PNG/HTML output'
  - Realistic and relatable data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that clearly
    demonstrates correlation
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
    (seed=42)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good marker transparency (alpha=0.7) revealing data density
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling is too prominent (alpha=0.5 with dashed lines) - should use alpha
    0.3-0.4 with solid lines for subtlety
  - Title font size appears small relative to the canvas - could be increased from
    64pt to 72pt+ for better prominence
