review:
  strengths:
  - Clean use of seaborn kdeplot for density visualization with both filled regions
    and contour lines
  - Excellent visual clarity with viridis colormap and well-sized white contour lines
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Effective bimodal distribution showing urban heat island concept
  weaknesses:
  - Uses KDE density estimation instead of true scalar field contours z=f(x,y) as
    specified - the spec explicitly mentions meshgrid and scalar values at each grid
    point
  - Missing labeled contour levels which spec suggests when practical
  - Data represents probability density rather than physical scalar values like temperature
    or elevation
