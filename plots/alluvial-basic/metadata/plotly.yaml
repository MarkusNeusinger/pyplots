review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alluvial/Sankey diagram implementation using Plotly go.Sankey
  - Clear visualization of voter migration patterns across 4 election cycles (2012-2024)
  - Consistent category colors across all time points with good transparency on flow
    links
  - Well-implemented custom hover templates showing detailed flow information
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of annotations for year labels at top of each column
  - Horizontal legend at bottom is clean and non-intrusive
  - Realistic voter migration data with plausible transition patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels on the bars are slightly small relative to the large canvas size -
    could be increased for better readability
  - The y-position ordering places Conservative at top but the visual shows it with
    largest bar - consider if ordering by size would improve readability
