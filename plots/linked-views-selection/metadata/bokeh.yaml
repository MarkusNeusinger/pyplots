review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh native linked selection through shared ColumnDataSource
  - Well-implemented CustomJS callback for updating histogram and bar chart on selection
  - Provides both HTML (interactive) and PNG (static) outputs
  - Good use of selection/nonselection styling (red selection color, gray nonselection
    with 0.15 alpha)
  - Clean, accessible color palette (blue/yellow/green avoids red-green colorblind
    issues)
  - Proper tool configuration with BoxSelectTool, LassoSelectTool, and TapTool
  weaknesses:
  - Missing an explicit legend explaining the color-to-species mapping
  - Subplot dimensions (2350x1250 each) result in total of ~4700x2500, slightly under
    the 4800x2700 target
  - Text sizes could be increased slightly for better readability at full resolution
  - Missing a dedicated Clear Selection button (relies on toolbar reset which resets
    zoom too)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid layout with four coordinated views.
    Top-left: A scatter plot showing Sepal Length (cm) vs Sepal Width (cm) with 150
    data points distributed across three clusters colored blue (Species A), yellow
    (Species B), and green (Species C). Top-right: A linked scatter plot showing Value
    (units) vs Sepal Width (cm) with the same color encoding. Bottom-left: A histogram
    showing the Value Distribution with blue bars spanning approximately 5-25 units.
    Bottom-right: A categorical bar chart showing Category Distribution with three
    equal-height bars (50 each) for Species A (blue), B (yellow), and C (green). The
    main title "linked-views-selection · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is positioned at the
    top. Interactive tools (pan, wheel zoom, box select, lasso, tap) are visible in
    the toolbar. The overall layout is well-organized with clear visual separation
    between panels.'
