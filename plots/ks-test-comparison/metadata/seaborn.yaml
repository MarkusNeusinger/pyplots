review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn sns.ecdfplot with hue parameter for idiomatic grouped
    ECDF plotting
  - Strong visual storytelling with vertical max-distance line, intersection dots,
    shaded fill band, and annotated KS statistic/p-value
  - Colorblind-safe design with both color and linestyle differentiation (solid vs
    dashed)
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate data parameters (beta distributions,
    FICO-like range, different sample sizes)
  - Complete spec compliance with all six specification requirements met
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance could improve: some dead space on left edge and annotation box
    slightly crowds lower-right data region'
  - Legend and linestyle manipulation relies on fragile index-based access to internal
    matplotlib objects (get_lines()[0], get_lines()[1])
  - Could benefit from slightly more sophisticated aesthetic treatment for publication-grade
    polish (whitespace management, background refinement)
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) comparing credit score distributions for "Good Customers" (blue, dashed
    line) and "Bad Customers" (orange, solid line). The x-axis shows "Credit Score
    (points)" ranging from approximately 370 to 850, and the y-axis shows "Cumulative
    Proportion" from 0.0 to 1.0. A dashed vertical black line at approximately x=590
    marks the point of maximum divergence between the two ECDFs, with two black dots
    (white-edged) at the intersections. A subtle light-orange shaded band highlights
    the region around the max divergence point. An annotation box with rounded corners
    displays "K-S Statistic = 0.463" and "p-value = 9.69e-24", connected to the mid-point
    by an arrow. A small italic "max distance" label sits near the upper intersection
    point. The legend is in the upper left corner. The title reads "Credit Score Distributions
    · ks-test-comparison · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The design uses a clean whitegrid
    style with removed top and right spines, subtle y-axis gridlines, and a professional
    color scheme.
