  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with title at 32pt and axis labels at 24pt for high readability
    at 4800x2700
  - Clean, professional appearance with plotly_white template
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (salary distributions by department) that demonstrates
    box plot features
  - Good feature coverage showing outliers, varying medians, and different distribution
    spreads
  - Proper dollar formatting on Y-axis with tickformat
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The $5k outlier in Sales is unrealistically low for annual salary data
  - Does not leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates or quartile
    annotations
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box plots showing salary distributions across
    departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance). Each box uses a different
    color: Engineering (muted blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales (blue), HR (light yellow),
    Finance (gray). The title "box-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top. The Y-axis shows "Annual Salary ($)" with values ranging from $0 to $140,000,
    formatted with dollar signs and commas. The X-axis shows "Department" with 5 category
    labels. Each box shows the median line, quartile box, and whiskers. Outliers are
    visible as individual points - notably two outliers in Sales (one very high ~$147k,
    one very low ~$5k) and one in Engineering (~$57k). The background is clean white
    with subtle horizontal gridlines.'
