review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating annotation heights to prevent label overlap
  - High-quality visual design with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean color scheme with good contrast (blue line, yellow annotations)
  - Interactive hover templates provide rich information
  - Realistic stock price scenario with appropriate event types
  - Proper use of Plotly shape and annotation features
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible at 0.2-0.3
  - Does not leverage Plotly-specific interactive features like rangeslider
  - Creates both PNG and HTML outputs when only PNG is required
