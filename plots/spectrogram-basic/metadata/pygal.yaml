review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a custom spectrogram visualization using pygal Graph
    subclass
  - Viridis colormap is perceptually uniform and colorblind-accessible as specified
  - Clear chirp signal pattern with visible harmonic demonstrates the plot type well
  - Proper dB scale for power representation with labeled colorbar
  - Well-labeled axes with appropriate units (Time in seconds, Frequency in Hz)
  - Correct title format following pyplots conventions
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar has only 3 tick marks, could benefit from more granular scale
  - No subtle grid lines to help read values
  - Cell resolution is slightly blocky due to downsampling for pygal performance
