review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot with multiple=stack for native stacked histogram
    support
  - Clean realistic data scenario with server response times that clearly demonstrates
    the plot type
  - Perfect title format and professional styling with appropriate font sizes
  - Good color palette with white edge lines providing clear segment separation
  - Proper use of hue_order to control logical stacking order
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned outside the plot area to avoid any potential overlap
    with tall bars
  - Color palette could use a more colorblind-optimized palette like colorblind or
    Set2
