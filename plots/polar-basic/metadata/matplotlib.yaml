review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of hourly temperature as a realistic application perfectly suited
    for polar visualization
  - Smart use of set_theta_zero_location("N") and clockwise direction for intuitive
    time reading (midnight at top)
  - Beautiful color scheme with blue points and contrasting yellow connecting line
  - Proper square format (12x12) for polar chart maintains circular proportions
  - Clean radial labels with temperature units (°C)
  - Well-implemented closed loop connecting first and last data points
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explanatory context - no subtitle or annotation explaining this is simulated
    daily temperature data
  - Could leverage more matplotlib polar features like fill_between for area emphasis
