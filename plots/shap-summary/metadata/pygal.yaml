review:
  strengths:
  - Credit risk model context is realistic and domain-appropriate
  - Features are correctly sorted by mean absolute SHAP value (most important at top)
  - Code structure is clean with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Title format follows the required convention exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Output is a grouped horizontal bar chart instead of a beeswarm scatter plot with
    per-sample dots colored by feature value
  - The code attempts to create an XY scatter with per-sample points and jitter but
    the rendered output shows aggregated bars instead
  - Missing the diverging blue-to-red color gradient based on feature values (low=blue,
    high=red)
  - No visible x=0 reference line to separate positive and negative SHAP impacts
  - X-axis shows only positive values (mean absolute) instead of the full negative-to-positive
    SHAP range
