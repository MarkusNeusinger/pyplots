review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of XY chart to simulate network graph layout
  - Clear 4-level hierarchy with color-coded levels
  - Good canvas utilization with nodes well-distributed
  - Realistic organizational chart data scenario
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data definitions
  - Interactive HTML output with tooltips for node labels
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (CEO, VP Eng, etc.) not visible directly on the plot - only in tooltips
  - Axis labels are generic and do not provide meaningful context
  - Title uses regular dots instead of middle dots
  image_description: The plot displays a hierarchical network graph representing an
    organizational structure with 4 levels. At the top (y=95) sits a single dark blue
    node representing the CEO. Below at y≈67 are three yellow/gold nodes representing
    VPs (Engineering, Sales, Ops). The third level at y≈38 shows seven teal/cyan nodes
    representing Directors (FE, BE, DevOps, Americas, EMEA, Logistics, HR). The bottom
    level at y=10 displays eleven coral/red nodes representing Managers. Black lines
    connect parent nodes to their children, clearly showing the reporting relationships.
    The layout uses the full canvas well with nodes evenly distributed horizontally
    at each level. A legend at the bottom identifies each level by color. The title
    follows the correct format "network-hierarchical · pygal · pyplots.ai". Axes are
    labeled "Organization Width" and "Hierarchy Level (Top to Bottom)". The white
    background provides good contrast.
