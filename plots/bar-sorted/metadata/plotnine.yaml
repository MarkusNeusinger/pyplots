review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pd.Categorical to enforce sort order in plotnine
  - Value labels above bars improve readability
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar of graphics implementation
  - Good font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Appropriate rotation of x-axis labels to prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Could highlight top category with different color as spec suggests
  - No random seed comment (data is deterministic but convention not followed)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sorted bar chart showing "Monthly sales
    by product category" with 8 vertical bars arranged in descending order from left
    to right. The bars use a consistent blue color (#306998). Categories from highest
    to lowest: Electronics (4850), Furniture (3720), Clothing (3150), Food & Beverage
    (2890), Home & Garden (2340), Sports (1980), Books (1450), and Toys (920). Each
    bar has a value label above it. The title "bar-sorted · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. X-axis labels are rotated 30 degrees for readability. Y-axis
    shows "Sales ($ thousands)" and X-axis shows "Product Category". Horizontal grid
    lines are subtle. The overall layout is clean with good use of canvas space.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_bar, geom_text, pd.Categorical for
          ordering, theme customization. Good use of plotnine idioms but could use
          scale_* functions for more distinctive styling
  verdict: APPROVED
