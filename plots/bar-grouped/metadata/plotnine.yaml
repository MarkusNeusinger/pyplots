review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visual presentation with well-proportioned bars and spacing
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business scenario (quarterly revenue by product line) that clearly demonstrates
    grouped bar comparison
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Simple, maintainable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend order (alphabetical: Hardware, Services, Software) does not match the
    visual bar order, causing slight confusion when reading the chart'
  - 'Two shades of blue (dark #306998 and light #4B8BBE) could be harder to distinguish
    for colorblind users; consider using more distinct hues'
  - Does not leverage plotnine-specific features like scale_fill_brewer for built-in
    colorblind-safe palettes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    by product line. There are 4 quarters (Q1-Q4) on the x-axis, with 3 bars per quarter
    representing Hardware (dark blue #306998), Services (yellow #FFD43B), and Software
    (light blue #4B8BBE). The y-axis shows "Revenue ($ millions)" ranging from 0 to
    ~165. The title "bar-grouped · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top.
    A legend labeled "Product Line" appears on the right side. The plot uses a minimal
    theme with subtle gray gridlines. Software consistently shows the highest revenue,
    growing from ~120 in Q1 to ~165 in Q4, while Hardware remains relatively stable
    (78-92) and Services grows modestly (45-70).'

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate, but legend shows categories in alphabetical
          order (Hardware, Services, Software) rather than the order they appear in
          the bars (Software, Hardware, Services), which creates confusion when reading

        comment: Basic ggplot usage with geom_bar and position_dodge; could leverage
          plotnine's grammar more (e.g., faceting, stat transformations, or scale_fill_brewer
          for color palettes)
  verdict: APPROVED
