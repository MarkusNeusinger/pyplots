  strengths:
  - Excellent use of housing price prediction as a realistic regression context that
    makes the residual analysis meaningful
  - Clear U-shaped trend in residuals demonstrates non-linearity detection, which
    is the primary purpose of residual plots
  - Good implementation of outlier highlighting with color differentiation (blue/yellow)
    using hue parameter
  - Reference line at y=0 and ±2 SD bands provide clear visual guides for interpretation
  - Proper use of seaborn regplot for polynomial trend line with confidence interval
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use seaborn built-in residplot function which is specifically designed
    for this plot type
  - The Trend label in regplot line_kws does not appear in the legend (seaborn regplot
    does not add to legend automatically)
  image_description: The plot shows a residual plot for housing price prediction.
    Blue scatter points (labeled "Normal") represent residuals within 2 standard deviations,
    while yellow points (labeled "Outlier (|z| > 2)") mark outliers beyond that threshold.
    A solid black horizontal reference line at y=0 divides the plot. Gray dashed horizontal
    lines mark the ±2 SD boundaries (~±55,000). A red curved polynomial trend line
    (order=2) with a pink confidence band shows the U-shaped pattern in residuals,
    revealing non-linearity in the underlying model. The x-axis shows "Fitted Values
    (Predicted Price in $)" ranging from ~100,000 to ~600,000, and the y-axis shows
    "Residuals (Actual - Predicted)" ranging from ~-60,000 to ~80,000. The title correctly
    follows the format "residual-plot · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The legend in the upper
    right shows "Normal", "Outlier (|z| > 2)", and "±2 SD". A subtle grid is visible
    in the background.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot and sns.regplot which are seaborn functions,
          but regplot is used only for the trend line rather than its main purpose
          (regression visualization). The implementation could leverage seaborn's
          residplot function which is specifically designed for residual plots.
  verdict: APPROVED
