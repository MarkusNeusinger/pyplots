review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including jittered
    points, confidence intervals, and decision threshold
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like AreaRangeSeries for CI and plotLines
    for threshold
  - Bootstrap method for confidence intervals shows statistical rigor
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette
  - Clear labeling with model accuracy annotation
  weaknesses:
  - Class 0 points (blue) have same color family as the logistic curve making them
    less distinct - could use a different hue
  - The for loop for bootstrap adds complexity to an otherwise linear structure
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression visualization with the
    characteristic S-shaped (sigmoid) probability curve in blue. The X-axis shows
    "Study Hours" (ranging 0-10) and Y-axis shows "Probability" (ranging -0.05 to
    1.05). Blue circular scatter points representing the "Fail (0)" class are clustered
    near y=0 with slight jitter, while yellow/gold circular scatter points for "Pass
    (1)" class are clustered near y=1. A light blue semi-transparent confidence interval
    band surrounds the logistic curve. A gray dashed horizontal line at y=0.5 indicates
    the decision threshold with a label "Decision Threshold (0.5)" on the right side.
    An annotation box in the lower right shows "Accuracy: 92.7%". The legend at the
    bottom displays: 95% CI, Logistic Curve, Fail (0), Pass (1). The title correctly
    follows the format "logistic-regression · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle
    "Exam Pass Probability vs Study Hours".'
