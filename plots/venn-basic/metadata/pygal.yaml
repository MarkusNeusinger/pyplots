review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using XY chart to draw circles since pygal lacks native Venn
    support
  - All 7 regions are properly labeled with correct counts
  - Good color palette with transparency for overlapping regions
  - Legend includes set totals which adds useful information
  - Mathematically correct calculation of exclusive regions
  - HTML output provided for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Rendering artifact visible as a thin vertical line on the right edge of the yellow
    circle
  - Implementation relies heavily on manual SVG text injection rather than pygal native
    features
  - Circles are not proportional to set sizes as mentioned in spec
  - Bottom margin has excess whitespace; circles could be more centered
