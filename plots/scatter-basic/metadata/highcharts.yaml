review:
  strengths:
  - Clean scatter plot with good positive correlation visible
  - Title follows exact required format (spec-id · library · pyplots.ai)
  - Appropriate marker size and transparency (alpha 0.7) for 100 data points
  - Grid lines subtle with dashed styling and low opacity
  - Uses colorblind-safe Python Blue color
  - Correct KISS structure with inline script execution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or realistic context
  - Data uses abstract random values rather than a realistic scenario like height/weight
    or spend/revenue
