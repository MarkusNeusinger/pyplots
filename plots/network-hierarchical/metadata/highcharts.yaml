review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts organization chart module which is purpose-built for
    hierarchical data
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between levels
  - Proper title format and informative legend in subtitle
  - Realistic organizational chart scenario matching spec applications
  - Good canvas utilization with hierarchy spread across the image
  weaknesses:
  - Connection lines could be slightly thicker for better visibility at full resolution
  - Node width is uniform; varying by level depth could improve visual hierarchy
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical organization chart with 4 levels
    arranged vertically from top to bottom. At the top is the CEO node in dark blue
    (#306998). Below are 3 VP nodes (VP Engineering, VP Sales, VP Operations) in yellow
    (#FFD43B). The third level contains 7 Director nodes in teal/cyan (#17BECF): Dir
    Frontend, Dir Backend, Dir DevOps, Dir Americas, Dir EMEA, Dir Logistics, and
    Dir HR. The bottom level shows 11 Manager nodes in pink (#E377C2): Mgr React,
    Mgr Vue, Mgr API, Mgr Database, Mgr Cloud, Mgr NA Sales, Mgr LATAM, Mgr UK Sales,
    Mgr DE Sales, Mgr Supply, and Mgr Talent. Gray connecting lines show parent-child
    relationships between nodes. The title "network-hierarchical · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold text with a color-coded legend showing the four hierarchy
    levels. All nodes are rounded rectangles with readable text labels. The layout
    uses Highcharts organization chart type with inverted (top-to-bottom) orientation,
    white background, and appropriate spacing between levels.'
