review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot coord_map() for map projections
  - Clear visualization of Tissot indicatrices showing Mercator distortion at different
    latitudes
  - Well-designed color scheme with good accessibility (blue/yellow contrast)
  - Proper graticule at standard intervals (30° lat, 60° lon)
  - Clean manual legend implementation using geom_point + geom_text
  - Informative caption explaining the Tissot indicatrices concept
  - High-quality export with 3x scaling for final resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Only shows single projection (Mercator) rather than multiple projections side-by-side
    for comparison as suggested in spec
  - Grid is completely removed (element_blank) but map projections benefit from graticule
    visibility which is achieved through geom_path
  image_description: The plot displays a world map using a Mercator-style projection
    with all major continents rendered in blue (#306998). The continents shown include
    North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica
    at the bottom. Graticule lines (dashed gray) are displayed at 30° latitude intervals
    and 60° longitude intervals. Yellow (#FFD43B) Tissot indicatrices are distributed
    across the map at 5 latitude bands (-60°, -30°, 0°, 30°, 60°) showing how equal-area
    circles appear distorted at different latitudes - circles at higher latitudes
    appear larger due to Mercator distortion. A manual legend in the bottom-left identifies
    "Land Masses" (blue) and "Tissot Indicatrices" (yellow). The title correctly follows
    the format "map-projections · letsplot · pyplots.ai". Axis labels show "Longitude
    (°)" and "Latitude (°)" with degree units. A caption at the bottom explains the
    Tissot indicatrices concept. The background is light gray with a light blue panel
    representing water/ocean.
