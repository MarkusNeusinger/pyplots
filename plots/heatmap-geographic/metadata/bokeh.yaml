review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of geographic heatmap with proper Web Mercator projection
  - Clean Gaussian smoothing for continuous density appearance
  - Appropriate use of WMTSTileSource for CartoDB basemap integration
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Good colormap choice (YlOrRd) with transparency for basemap visibility
  - Well-structured synthetic data with realistic California monitoring station clusters
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive hover information on monitoring stations
  - Axis labels lack degree symbols or units
  - Colorbar title font size could be larger for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic heatmap of California and surrounding
    western US states rendered on a CartoDB Positron basemap. Three distinct density
    clusters are visible: (1) Northern California around Sacramento/SF Bay Area at
    ~38.5°N latitude, (2) Central California coast around Monterey at ~36.5°N latitude,
    and (3) Southern California around Los Angeles at ~34°N latitude. Blue scatter
    points (500 total) represent individual environmental monitoring stations. The
    heatmap uses a YlOrRd colormap with yellow/white indicating high AQI density values
    and red/dark red indicating lower density areas. A vertical colorbar on the right
    displays "AQI Density" ranging from 0 to ~30. The title "heatmap-geographic ·
    bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left. Axis labels show "Longitude" (-125
    to -110) and "Latitude" (32 to 42) in Web Mercator projection.'
