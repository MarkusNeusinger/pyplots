review:
  strengths:
  - Total labels are well-implemented using pygal value formatter with clear $XXK
    formatting
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent theming
  - Appropriate chart sizing (4800x2700) with proper font scaling
  - Clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic quarterly revenue data with meaningful seasonal variations
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is cut off - only Electronics and Furniture visible; Clothing
    and Accessories are truncated
  - Bottom margin needs to be increased to accommodate full legend display
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart with 4 quarters (Q1, Q2,
    Q3, Q4) on the x-axis and Revenue ($K) on the y-axis. Each bar is composed of
    4 stacked segments representing product categories: Electronics (steel blue),
    Furniture (golden yellow), Clothing (teal/turquoise), and Accessories (coral/salmon).
    Total value labels are prominently displayed above each bar stack showing "Total:
    $312K", "Total: $364K", "Total: $346K", and "Total: $430K" respectively. The title
    correctly displays "bar-stacked-labeled · pygal · pyplots.ai". The legend is placed
    at the bottom but is partially cut off - only "Electronics" and "Furniture" labels
    are fully visible, while "Clothing" and "Accessories" appear truncated at the
    bottom edge of the image. The chart has a white background with subtle horizontal
    grid lines.'
