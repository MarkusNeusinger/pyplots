review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex Circos plot using only polygon geoms
  - Clear visual hierarchy with outer ring, two expression tracks, and ribbon connections
  - Well-chosen colorblind-friendly color palette with 8 distinct colors
  - Realistic genomic data scenario with appropriate chromosome naming and sizing
  - Good use of alpha transparency to show overlapping ribbons without obscuring information
  - Clean legend placement at bottom
  - Both PNG and HTML output generated
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" not "Genomic Rearrangements
    · circos-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
  - Could reduce whitespace at bottom of plot
  - Interactive features of letsplot not fully utilized (tooltips would enhance the
    visualization)
