review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (Q for
    quantitative, N for nominal)
  - Clean visual hierarchy with well-chosen color palette (Python Blue as primary)
  - Good use of layering (bars + average line + annotation text)
  - Interactive tooltips enhance usability
  - Proper canvas sizing (1600x900 with scale_factor=3.0) following library guidelines
  - Creative solution using mark_rect with y/y2 encoding to create horizontal bars
  - Cluster averages clearly communicated both in legend and via annotation
  weaknesses:
  - The Avg annotation text position (y=5) places it at the bottom of the chart rather
    than at a more prominent position
  - No interactive selection or highlighting when hovering over clusters (missed Altair
    strength)
  - Bars extending from 0 to silhouette value using x2=alt.value(0) could be clearer
