quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Iris dataset as a canonical clustering example with realistic
    silhouette scores
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good visual separation of clusters with distinct colors and sorted bars within
    each cluster
  - Proper title format and informative legend showing cluster averages
  - Appropriate chart type (HorizontalStackedBar) adapted for silhouette visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing vertical reference line at the overall average silhouette score (0.553)
    as specified in the requirements
  - Cluster average annotations only appear in legend, not directly on the plot as
    specified
  - No negative silhouette values shown in the data, limiting demonstration of potential
    misclassification
