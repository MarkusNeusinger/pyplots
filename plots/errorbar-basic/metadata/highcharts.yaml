review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native errorbar series type with proper whisker and
    stem configuration
  - Clear visible error bar caps with appropriate line widths
  - Professional typography with well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme (blue bars, black error bars)
  - Proper HTML export alongside PNG for interactivity
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate marginBottom for x-axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only shows Mean Value entry visible; the Error Range entry may be cut off
    or not rendering properly
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g. Measured Value units would be more informative)
  - Only demonstrates symmetric error bars; spec mentions asymmetric errors as a feature
