review:
  strengths:
  - 'Dual output approach: Interactive HTML with real tiles (geom_livemap + CARTO_POSITRON)
    AND static PNG with simulated tile appearance'
  - Excellent visual design with high-contrast yellow markers against muted tile background
  - Proper tile provider attribution included in caption
  - 'Smart use of lets-plot features: layer_tooltips for hover info, tilesets for
    real tile providers'
  - Well-organized code with clear separation between interactive and static versions
  - Realistic European tourism data with 20 cities and plausible visitor counts
  weaknesses:
  - The static PNG version uses simplified landmass approximations rather than actual
    geospatial data, which reduces geographic accuracy
  - Legend position could be improved to be closer to the map area
  - No axis labels (though appropriate for map visualization, could include lat/lon
    scale reference)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a map of Europe displaying 20 European cities
    as circular markers on a simulated tile background. The background has a light
    gray grid pattern representing map tiles (CARTO Positron style) with tan/beige
    polygons approximating European landmasses including mainland Europe, Scandinavia,
    the British Isles, Ireland, Italy, and the Balkans. City markers are sized proportionally
    to visitor counts (tourists per year in thousands), with Paris showing the largest
    marker and smaller cities like Oslo and Helsinki showing the smallest. Markers
    use a striking yellow fill (#FFD43B) with blue (#306998) outline stroke, providing
    excellent contrast against the muted background. A legend on the right shows the
    size scale for 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 visitors. The title "European Tourism
    · map-tile-background · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. A caption
    at the bottom provides proper attribution: "Map tiles simulated (CARTO Positron
    style) | © OpenStreetMap contributors".'
