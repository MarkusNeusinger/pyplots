review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of violin plot from first principles using Bokeh patch
    and segment glyphs
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (mirrored KDE, quartile boxes,
    median lines, whiskers)
  - Realistic salary distribution scenario with varied distribution shapes demonstrating
    plot type strengths
  - Clean, well-commented code with proper KDE bandwidth calculation (Silverman rule)
  - Good color choices with Python blue/yellow alternating pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis uses scientific notation (2.000e+4) instead of human-readable currency
    format
  image_description: The plot displays four violin plots showing salary distributions
    across four departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). Each violin
    uses alternating Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) colors. The violins
    are mirrored/symmetrical showing kernel density estimation on both sides. Inside
    each violin is a white box showing quartiles (Q1-Q3), a horizontal black median
    line, and whiskers extending to 1.5×IQR. The title "violin-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. X-axis shows "Department" with category labels, Y-axis
    shows "Annual Salary (USD)" in scientific notation (2.000e+4 to 1.400e+5). Grid
    lines are subtle and dashed on the y-axis only. Each department shows distinct
    distribution shapes - Engineering has tight distribution around 85k, Marketing
    around 65k, Sales shows wider spread around 70k, and Support is narrower around
    50k.

        comment: Implements violin from scratch using patches rather than using Bokeh's
          built-in capabilities; while technically correct, doesn't showcase Bokeh-specific
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
