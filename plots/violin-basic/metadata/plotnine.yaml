review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data crafting with four distinctly-shaped distributions that showcase
    violin plot capabilities (right-skewed, bimodal, tight normal, wide spread)
  - Thoughtful color palette with Python Blue highlighting the most interesting bimodal
    distribution as a focal point
  - 'Comprehensive theme customization: subtle grid, soft background, refined typography
    with intentional color/size hierarchy'
  - Perfect spec compliance including quartile markers, mirrored density, and median
    line
  - Clean, idiomatic plotnine code following grammar of graphics patterns
  weaknesses:
  - 'Quartile lines inside violins could be slightly more prominent for easier reading
    at a glance (currently size=0.35 with #666666)'
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally for
    university courses: Biology (sage green), Statistics (deep blue/Python Blue),
    Chemistry (peach/salmon), and Psychology (light lavender). Each violin shows mirrored
    kernel density estimation with three horizontal quartile lines (Q1, median, Q3)
    visible inside. Biology shows a right-skewed distribution concentrated around
    68-70 with a small bump near 85. Statistics displays a clear bimodal distribution
    with two peaks around 55 and 82. Chemistry has a tight, narrow normal distribution
    centered around 74. Psychology shows a wide spread from roughly 30 to 100 centered
    around 70. The title "violin-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at
    the top. X-axis labeled "Course", Y-axis labeled "Final Exam Score (pts)". Background
    is a soft off-white (#fafafa) with subtle horizontal gridlines only. No legend
    is shown (category labels on x-axis suffice). The color palette is harmonious
    with the Statistics violin highlighted in Python Blue as the focal element.'

        comment: draw_quantiles and fine-grained theme element control are distinctive
          to plotnine/ggplot2, but the overall visualization could be replicated in
          other libraries.
