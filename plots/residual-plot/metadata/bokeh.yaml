review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features (Band, Span, Label, ColumnDataSource)
  - Clear differentiation between normal residuals and outliers using distinct colors
  - Well-designed ±2 SD reference bands with proper labeling
  - Realistic housing price prediction context with appropriate data scale
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  weaknesses:
  - The +2 SD and -2 SD labels are quite small and positioned very close to the band
    edges, making them hard to read
  - Legend text size could be slightly larger for better visibility at the 4800x2700
    resolution
  image_description: "The plot displays a residual plot for regression diagnostics\
    \ with a light gray (#fafafa) background. The title \"residual-plot · bokeh ·\
    \ pyplots.ai\" appears at the top left in dark gray text. The x-axis shows \"\
    Fitted Values (Predicted Price in $1000s)\" ranging from ~125 to ~475, and the\
    \ y-axis shows \"Residuals (Observed - Predicted)\" ranging from approximately\
    \ -100 to +100. \n\nBlue circular markers (Python blue #306998) represent normal\
    \ residuals scattered around the zero line. Yellow/gold markers (#FFD43B) with\
    \ blue borders highlight outliers beyond ±2 standard deviations - visible at the\
    \ extreme top and bottom of the plot. A solid blue horizontal reference line at\
    \ y=0 indicates perfect predictions. A light gray shaded band spans the ±2 SD\
    \ region (~-50 to ~+50), bounded by dashed gray lines. Small italic labels \"\
    +2 SD\" and \"-2 SD\" appear near the left edge of the band boundaries. The legend\
    \ in the top-left corner shows \"Residuals\" and \"Outliers (>2 SD)\". The grid\
    \ is subtle with dashed lines and low alpha."
