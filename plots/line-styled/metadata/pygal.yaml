review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all 4 standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted,
    dash-dot) using pygal stroke_dasharray
  - Clear, readable text with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Realistic temperature sensor data scenario with seasonal variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of custom Style for large canvas sizing
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper left could be moved to avoid any potential overlap with
    data
  - Color palette includes red-green combination; while line styles provide differentiation,
    a more colorblind-friendly palette would be better
  - Could showcase more pygal-specific features like tooltips or value labels
  image_description: "The plot displays a styled line chart showing temperature measurements\
    \ from 4 sensors over 12 months (January to December). The title \"line-styled\
    \ · pygal · pyplots.ai\" appears at the top. The y-axis displays \"Temperature\
    \ (°C)\" ranging from approximately 3-28°C, and the x-axis shows \"Month\" with\
    \ all 12 months labeled clearly. Four data series are shown with distinct line\
    \ styles:\n- **Sensor A (Solid)** - Blue solid line with circular markers\n- **Sensor\
    \ B (Dashed)** - Yellow dashed line with circular markers  \n- **Sensor C (Dotted)**\
    \ - Red dotted line with circular markers\n- **Sensor D (Dash-Dot)** - Green dash-dot\
    \ line with circular markers\n\nThe legend is positioned in the upper left corner\
    \ outside the plot area. All four line styles are clearly distinguishable from\
    \ each other. The data shows a realistic seasonal temperature pattern (low in\
    \ winter months, peaking in July). The plot has a clean white background with\
    \ subtle horizontal grid lines."

        comment: Lines and markers are well-sized and clearly visible. Line thickness
          and marker size are appropriate.

        passed: true
        comment: Colors are reasonably distinguishable (blue, yellow, red, green),
          but red-green combination could be challenging for some colorblind viewers.
          However, line styles provide additional differentiation.

        comment: Grid is subtle with only y-guides shown. Legend placement in upper
          left is acceptable but overlaps with plot area slightly.

        comment: Temperature values are realistic for a temperate climate (5-28°C).
          Some values in Sensor C dip quite low (~1°C in December) which is plausible
          but at the edge.

        comment: Uses pygal's stroke_style with dasharray for line styles, custom
