review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all key residual plot features: zero reference line,
    ±2 SD bands, outlier highlighting, and smoothing trend line'
  - Good color scheme with distinct visual encoding for normal residuals (blue circles),
    outliers (yellow diamonds), and trend (red line)
  - Interactive hover templates provide useful diagnostic information (fitted value
    and residual)
  - Data generation creates interesting non-linear pattern that demonstrates the diagnostic
    purpose of residual plots
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows +2 SD and -2 SD as separate entries; could be combined into single
    ±2 SD Bounds entry
  - Axis labels lack units (though residuals are unitless, y-axis label is verbose)
  - Moving average smoothing could benefit from using a more sophisticated LOWESS
    approach for smoother trend detection
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot with fitted values on the x-axis
    (ranging from approximately -1 to 30) and residuals on the y-axis (ranging from
    approximately -6 to 5). The main data points are shown as blue circular markers
    with semi-transparency. Outliers (points beyond ±2 standard deviations) are highlighted
    as yellow/gold diamond-shaped markers. The plot includes a solid black horizontal
    reference line at y=0, dashed yellow/gold lines at ±2 standard deviations (~±3.8),
    and a red trend line (smoothing curve) that shows slight curvature from the left
    side before flattening out. The title reads "residual-plot · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    centered at the top. The legend is positioned in the upper-left corner with a
    white background, showing all trace types. The overall layout uses a clean white
    background with subtle grid lines.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1), legend well-placed with background; however,
          legend shows both +2 SD and -2 SD as separate entries which is slightly
          redundant
