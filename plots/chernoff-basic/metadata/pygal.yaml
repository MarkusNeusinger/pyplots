review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to implementing Chernoff faces using pygal SVG infrastructure
    with custom drawing
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 5 distinct colors
  - Clear feature mapping legend explaining what each facial feature represents
  - Good variation in facial expressions showing different car personalities
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  - Produces both SVG and PNG outputs with HTML wrapper for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses functions (add_element, draw_chernoff_face) which violates the KISS
    structure requirement
  - Significant white space above and below the faces could be reduced for better
    canvas utilization
  - Feature mapping legend is placed too far below the faces with excessive gap
  - Minimal use of pygal native chart features - mostly custom SVG manipulation
