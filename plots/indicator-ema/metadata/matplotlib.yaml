review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adherence to specification with price line and two EMA periods
  - Crossover points clearly highlighted with prominent red markers and white edges
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color choices
  - Proper use of pandas ewm() for authentic EMA calculation
  - Good text sizing and rotation for date labels
  - Realistic financial data simulation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps with the initial price data slightly in upper left
  - Could add shaded regions between EMA lines to better visualize convergence/divergence
  - Crossover markers lack labels explaining whether golden cross or death cross
  image_description: 'The plot displays a financial time series chart spanning from
    January 2024 to June 2024. Three lines are shown: a dark gray/black "Price" line
    showing daily closing prices with significant volatility, a blue "EMA 12" (12-period
    Exponential Moving Average) line that follows the price more closely, and a yellow/gold
    "EMA 26" (26-period EMA) line that is smoother and lags more behind price movements.
    The price starts around $150-165, trends downward to approximately $118-120 in
    late March, then fluctuates between $120-135 for the remainder of the period.
    Red circular markers with white edges highlight crossover points where the EMA
    12 crosses the EMA 26 line. The chart has a clean white background with subtle
    gray dashed grid lines, properly formatted date labels on the x-axis (rotated
    for readability), and "Price ($)" on the y-axis. The title follows the correct
    format: "indicator-ema · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Legend is positioned in the
    upper left corner.'
