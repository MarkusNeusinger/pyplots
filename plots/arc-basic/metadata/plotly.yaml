review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of arc diagram with proportional arc heights based
    on node distance
  - Clean use of semi-transparency (0.6 opacity) for overlapping arcs improves readability
  - Good color scheme with high contrast between nodes (yellow) and arcs (blue)
  - Proper use of weight-based line widths to distinguish connection strength
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has excessive whitespace below the baseline that could be reduced by adjusting
    y-axis range
  - Could add hover information showing connection details (source, target, weight)
    for better interactivity
  - Missing edge color coding by type or weight as suggested in spec notes
  image_description: The plot displays a basic arc diagram with 10 nodes (Alice, Bob,
    Carol, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Iris, Jack) arranged horizontally along
    a gray baseline. Each node is represented by a yellow circular marker with a blue
    border. The nodes are connected by semi-transparent blue parabolic arcs above
    the baseline. Arc heights vary based on the distance between connected nodes -
    short-range connections (e.g., Alice-Bob) have lower arcs while long-range connections
    (e.g., Alice-Iris) have higher arcs. The arcs have varying thicknesses based on
    connection weights. The title "arc-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top in dark text on a clean white background.
