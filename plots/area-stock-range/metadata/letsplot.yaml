review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent multi-panel layout using gggrid with proper height ratios
  - Realistic stock price data with geometric Brownian motion + trend + seasonality
  - Clean implementation of range selection buttons as visual indicators
  - Good use of layer_tooltips for HTML interactivity
  - Proper scaling (1600x900 base * 3 = 4800x2700 output)
  - 'Professional color scheme with consistent #306998 blue'
  weaknesses:
  - Text sizes could be increased for better legibility at full resolution (title
    26pt is good, but axis text at 14pt could be 16-18pt)
  - Button panel visual design could be improved - buttons look like a data visualization
    rather than UI elements
  - Navigator mini chart y-axis could show some tick values for context
  - Missing gradient fill that spec suggests would enhance the visualization
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a stock area chart with a range selector interface. The main chart (upper portion) shows approximately 6 months of price data from June to December, featuring a light blue semi-transparent filled area (alpha ~0.35) with a solid darker blue line (#306998) tracing the price movements. The y-axis is labeled "Price (USD)" ranging from ~180 to 235. The x-axis shows dates with good spacing (weekly intervals visible).

    Below the main chart is a navigator/mini chart showing the full 2-year data range from December 2023 to January 2026. A rectangular selection highlight indicates the currently viewed 6-month portion (Jun-Dec 2025). The mini chart uses lighter styling with reduced line weight.

    At the bottom is a row of range selection buttons: 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All. The "6M" button is highlighted in blue (#306998) indicating active selection, while others are gray. A label "Range Selection (Interactive in HTML)" clarifies the interactivity.

    The title "area-stock-range · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left in bold. Overall layout is well-organized with clear visual hierarchy between the three panels.
