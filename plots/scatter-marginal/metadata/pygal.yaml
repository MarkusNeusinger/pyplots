review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using PIL to composite three separate pygal charts into a cohesive
    marginal plot layout
  - Good alignment between marginal histograms and main scatter plot axes
  - Appropriate use of transparency (opacity=0.65) for scatter points
  - Clean color scheme with consistent blue (#306998) throughout
  - Correct title format and proper axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Top marginal histogram Y-axis has too many tick labels (0-26 in increments of
    2), making them appear crowded and hard to read; reduce to 4-5 major labels
  - Statistics box defined in code (correlation, means) is not visible in the final
    rendered image - either remove the code or fix the positioning
  - Marginal distributions use the same prominent blue as the scatter; spec recommends
    subtle colors for marginal distributions to not distract from the main scatter
    plot
