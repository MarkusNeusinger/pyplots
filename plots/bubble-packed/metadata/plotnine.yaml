review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm implementation with force simulation for tight
    packing
  - Area-based scaling for accurate visual perception of values
  - Clean visual design with theme_void and good color contrast
  - Realistic department budget scenario that clearly demonstrates the plot type
  - Good use of coord_fixed to maintain circular shapes
  - White borders around circles improve visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Label truncation ("Engineerin" instead of "Engineering", "Customer S" instead
    of "Customer Service") reduces readability for larger circles that have room
  - Color palette while distinct could be more explicitly colorblind-safe (consider
    using colorblind-tested palettes)
