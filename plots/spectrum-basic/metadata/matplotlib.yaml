review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent signal processing implementation with proper FFT computation and normalization
  - Clear visualization of frequency peaks with effective use of annotations and vertical
    reference lines
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes meeting 4800×2700 resolution
    requirements
  - dB scale properly implemented with floor to avoid log(0)
  - Fill under curve provides good visual emphasis of the spectrum shape
  weaknesses:
  - Line width (2.5) could be increased to 3 for better visibility at full resolution
  - No legend present, though for this single-series plot it is acceptable
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features like spine customization or logarithmic
    frequency scale option
