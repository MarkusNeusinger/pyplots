review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of arc diagram with proper proportional arc heights based
    on node distance
  - 'Clean visual design with Python-themed color palette (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow)'
  - Appropriate use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.55) for overlapping arcs
  - Weight-based arc thickness provides clear visual differentiation of connection
    strength
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (character interactions) that clearly demonstrates
    the plot type
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend showing what arc thickness represents (weight scale)
  - Could use color coding for different edge types or weights as mentioned in spec
    notes
  - Library features score could improve by using colormap for arcs based on weight
  image_description: The plot displays a basic arc diagram showing character interactions.
    Ten nodes (Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Iris, Jack) are
    arranged horizontally along a baseline, represented as yellow circles with blue
    borders. Curved blue arcs connect various character pairs above the baseline,
    with arc height proportional to the distance between connected characters. For
    example, the Alice-Jack connection spans the full width with the tallest arc,
    while adjacent connections like Alice-Bob have shorter arcs. Arc thickness varies
    based on connection weight, and arcs use semi-transparency (alpha ~0.55) to handle
    overlapping connections. The title "Character Interactions · arc-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Node labels are displayed below each node in
    bold blue text.

        comment: Uses matplotlib.patches.Arc which is appropriate, but doesn't leverage
          other matplotlib features like colormaps for edge colors or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
