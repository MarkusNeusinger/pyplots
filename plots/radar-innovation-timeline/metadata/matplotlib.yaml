review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all features from the specification are faithfully
    implemented including 270-degree arc, ring fills, sector divisions, and labeled
    items
  - Strong visual hierarchy through marker size scaling by ring (near-term prominent,
    far-future subtle) which reinforces the data story
  - Realistic, recognizable technology items with plausible ring assignments that
    make the chart immediately useful as a reference
  - Colorblind-safe palette with redundant marker shape encoding per sector
  - Smart label placement strategy with alternating above/below offsets, angular jittering,
    and white background boxes
  weaknesses:
  - Some label crowding in dense ring-sector intersections, particularly in the AI
    & ML Adopt/Trial area where RAG Pipelines and LLM Agents labels are very close
  - Item labels at fontsize 15 are slightly below the 16pt guideline for this canvas
    size
  image_description: 'The plot is a 270-degree (three-quarter circle) radar chart
    on a square canvas. Four concentric rings represent time horizons — Adopt (innermost,
    pastel blue fill), Trial (pastel green), Assess (pastel yellow), and Hold (outermost,
    pastel pink) — each labeled in bold italic gray text in the gap at the upper-right.
    Four angular sectors divide the arc: AI & ML (upper-left), Cloud & Infra (lower-left),
    Data Engineering (bottom), and Security (right), with bold black sector headers
    along the outer edge. Twenty-two technology items are plotted as colored markers:
    blue circles for AI & ML, orange squares for Cloud & Infra, teal-green diamonds
    for Data Engineering, and pink triangles for Security. Each marker has a white-backgrounded
    text label. Marker sizes decrease from inner rings (Adopt, largest) to outer rings
    (Hold, smallest), creating a visual hierarchy emphasizing near-term technologies.
    Gray boundary arcs and sector divider lines provide structure. A "Sectors" legend
    in the lower-right maps colors and shapes to categories. The title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" sits at the top.'

        comment: Marker sizes scaled by ring (280 to 130) create clear visual hierarchy.
          Different marker shapes per sector add redundant encoding.

        comment: Square 12x12 figure fits radar chart well. 270-degree arc uses space
          effectively. Some items near canvas edges slightly crowded.

          layout communicates strategic positioning. Sector grouping enables cross-category
