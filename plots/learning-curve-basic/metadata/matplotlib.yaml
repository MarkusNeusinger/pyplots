review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (Python blue/gold) that are colorblind-friendly
  - Perfect implementation of the spec requirements including confidence bands via
    fill_between
  - Clean, readable KISS-style code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good data simulation showing realistic overfitting pattern with training scores
    staying high while validation improves with more data
  - Proper sizing for all visual elements (markers, lines, fonts) at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarification that it is a dimensionless score
  - Could add annotations to highlight the overfitting gap or key insights about the
    learning curve
