review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layering system to combine decision boundary background
    with training points
  - Creative approach using mark_rect with binning to approximate decision regions
  - Good use of stroke encoding to distinguish correctly vs incorrectly classified
    points
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of independent color scales for the three legends
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional information on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Title separator appears to use a period/dot instead of the middot character (·)
    specified in the format
  - Three separate legends make the right side slightly busy - could potentially combine
    True Class and Decision Region legends since they share the same color scheme
  - Could use different marker shapes (circle vs triangle) for correct vs incorrect
    classification as the spec suggests rather than just stroke color
