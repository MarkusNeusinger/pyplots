review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom implementation extending pygal Graph class to create a chart
    type not natively supported
  - Clear visual distinction between all segments with white borders and colorblind-safe
    palette
  - Proper variable-width bars with widths proportional to regional totals (clearly
    labeled below each bar)
  - Percentage labels within segments enhance readability without cluttering
  - Y-axis percentage scale with subtle dashed gridlines provides good reference
  - Realistic market share scenario that perfectly demonstrates Marimekko use case
  - Clean SVG output with HTML wrapper for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Custom class violates KISS principle, though unavoidable since pygal lacks native
    Marimekko support
  - Legend placement at bottom creates some visual distance from the chart
  - Smallest segments (MEA region) are quite narrow, making labels cramped
