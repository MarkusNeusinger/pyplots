review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper aesthetics mapping for
    color, alpha, and size
  - Clear visual distinction between raw data (lighter blue, thin line) and rolling
    average (prominent yellow, thicker line)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of scale_alpha_manual and scale_size_manual for visual differentiation
  - Well-structured data transformation to long format for ggplot-style plotting
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels are slightly crowded with 7-day breaks over 6 months - could
    use monthly breaks for cleaner appearance
