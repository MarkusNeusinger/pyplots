review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to represent network graph despite pygal lacking
    native network support
  - Excellent force-directed layout algorithm implementation that clearly separates
    communities
  - Good color scheme with four distinct, colorblind-safe community colors
  - Interactive tooltips showing person name and connection count in SVG/HTML output
  - Clean code structure with well-commented sections
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: should be "network-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" not "Social
    Network · network-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"'
  - Network layout has diagonal bias leaving upper-right and lower-left corners mostly
    empty
  image_description: 'The plot displays a network graph visualization with 20 circular
    nodes arranged in a diagonal pattern from upper-left to lower-right. Four distinct
    community groups are visible, each colored differently: blue (Group A) in the
    upper-left, yellow (Group B) in the center-left, green (Group C) in the center,
    and orange (Group D) in the lower-right. Gray lines represent edges connecting
    nodes both within and between communities. The title "Social Network · network-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom shows "Connections",
    "Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D". The node sizes are uniform, and the
    force-directed layout successfully separates the communities while showing cross-group
    bridges.'

        comment: Uses pygal XY chart creatively for network visualization, custom
          Style, SVG interactivity with tooltips showing degree info; however pygal
          is not designed for network graphs so the approach is a workaround
  verdict: APPROVED
