review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing following the library guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Clean sinusoidal data pattern effectively demonstrates seasonal trends
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with appropriate styling (linewidth=3, marker=o,
    markersize=12)
  - Realistic temperature scenario with plausible values for temperate climate
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-balanced 16:9 layout with no clipping or overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Data shows a very smooth sinusoidal pattern; could benefit from slightly more
    variation to show real-world noise
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive statistical features (confidence intervals,
    error bands)
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing monthly temperature data
    over 12 months. A single blue line (#306998) connects 12 data points with circular
    markers. The line shows a clear sinusoidal pattern typical of seasonal temperature
    variation - starting low around 4°C in January/February, peaking at approximately
    30°C in July, then declining back to about 4°C in December. The x-axis is labeled
    "Month" with integer values 1-12, and the y-axis is labeled "Temperature (°C)"
    ranging from approximately 5 to 30. The title correctly displays "line-basic ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background. The
    overall layout is clean with good proportions.

          but doesn't leverage more distinctive features like confidence intervals
          or hue grouping
