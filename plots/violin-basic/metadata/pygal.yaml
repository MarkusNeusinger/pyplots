  strengths:
  - Creative manual KDE implementation using pygal XY chart with Silverman bandwidth
    selection
  - Well-chosen realistic educational data with 4 distinctly-shaped distributions
  - Custom cohesive 4-color palette with appropriate transparency
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features implemented correctly
  - Clean reproducible linear code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy dark IQR boxes visually dominate violin interiors, reducing elegance
  - Median line has poor contrast against dark IQR box
  - Y-axis label lacks units
  - Pygal default monospace font rendering limits visual refinement
  - Limited use of pygal-distinctive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 violin shapes representing test score distributions
    across class groups: Honors (steel blue), Standard (salmon/orange), Remedial (teal/green),
    and Advanced (gold/yellow). Each violin is mirrored symmetrically showing KDE
    density. Inside each violin is a large dark (#1a1a1a) filled IQR rectangle and
    a thin dark median line. The title "violin-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in a monospace-style font. The X-axis is labeled "Class Group" with
    category names below each violin, and the Y-axis is labeled "Test Score" with
    values from 30 to 100. The background is white with subtle horizontal y-axis grid
    lines. Honors is compact and high (~85-90), Standard is wider centered around
    ~74, Remedial is moderate spread around ~62, and Advanced is the widest spread
    centered around ~82.'

          low-level XY plotting since no native violin.

        comment: Leverages style system, fill/stroke/opacity, stroke_style. Color
          cycling for multi-series is clever but mostly generic XY plotting.
  verdict: REJECTED
