review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic response time data with meaningful clustering patterns (main cluster,
    slower responses, outliers)
  - Clean code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of custom Style for font sizes appropriate to 4800x2700 canvas
  - X-axis label includes units (ms)
  - Appropriate use of XY chart to simulate rug plot behavior
  weaknesses:
  - 'Poor vertical canvas utilization: rug ticks only occupy bottom ~15% of plot area
    despite tick_height=0.85, creating excessive whitespace'
  - Visible y-axis line on the left side that serves no purpose for a rug plot and
    should be hidden
  - Tick stroke width (8) may be too thin for dense clusters where individual ticks
    blend together
