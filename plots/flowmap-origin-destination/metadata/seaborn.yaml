review:
  strengths:
  - Well-structured code following KISS principle with clear data preparation flow
  - Good color encoding using YlOrRd sequential palette for flow magnitude
  - Appropriate marker sizing and alpha transparency for overlapping arcs
  - Realistic migration data scenario between major world cities
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - City labels overlap in the European cluster (London, Paris, Frankfurt)
  - Minimal seaborn usage - primarily relies on matplotlib for arc visualization
  - Missing basemap/country boundaries mentioned in spec notes
  - Colorbar could be positioned closer to the main plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays an origin-destination flow map showing migration
    flows between 12 major world cities. Blue circular markers (with white edge highlights)
    represent city locations plotted on a latitude/longitude coordinate system ranging
    from -180 to 180 longitude and -60 to 80 latitude. Cities are labeled in bold
    dark gray text positioned near their markers. Curved arcs connect origin-destination
    pairs, with colors following a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red) colormap where lighter
    yellow indicates lower flow volumes (~280) and darker red indicates higher volumes
    (~850). Arc thickness varies proportionally to flow magnitude. A colorbar on the
    right shows "Flow Volume" ranging from approximately 280 to 850. The background
    is a light grayish-blue (#f0f4f8). Dashed reference lines mark the equator (0°
    latitude) and prime meridian (0° longitude). A subtle dotted grid provides geographic
    reference. The title follows the correct format: "flowmap-origin-destination ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Seaborn is only used for scatterplot() and set_context(). The main
          visualization (curved arcs) is done entirely with matplotlib FancyArrowPatch.
          Does not leverage seaborn's statistical or aesthetic strengths.
