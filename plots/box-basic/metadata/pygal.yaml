  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with subtitle annotation showing highest/lowest median
    and salary gap — provides immediate narrative context
  - Colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito inspired palette with strong visual distinction between
    departments
  - Creative SVG post-processing to overcome pygal hardcoded limitations (box opacity
    increased to 0.7, outlier dots enlarged)
  - 'Comprehensive feature coverage: different distribution widths, centers, and outliers
    across multiple categories'
  - Full spec compliance with all required features (median, outliers, whiskers, distinct
    colors)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Outlier dots, while enlarged from r=3 to r=10, still appear relatively small on
    the 4800x2700 canvas — could benefit from being larger (r=14-16)
  - Regex-based SVG manipulation is fragile and could break with pygal version updates
  - Some unused vertical space in the lower portion of the plot area below the 20000
    gridline
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one for each department (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Operations, HR). The y-axis
    shows "Salary ($)" ranging from 20,000 to 140,000, and the x-axis shows "Department".
    Each box is rendered with a distinct color at approximately 70% opacity: Engineering
    in steel blue (#306998), Marketing in gold/amber (#E69F00), Sales in teal/green
    (#009E73), Operations in dark orange (#D55E00), and HR in medium purple (#7B68EE).
    Median lines are visible within each box. Whiskers extend from each box, and outlier
    dots are visible — Engineering has 2 high outliers (~130k, 135k) and 2 low outliers
    (~40k, 45k), Marketing has 1 high outlier (~105k), Sales has 1 high outlier (~138k)
    and 1 low outlier (~12k), and HR has 1 high outlier (~83k). The title "box-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in large font. Below the title, an
    italic subtitle annotation reads "Highest median: Engineering ($83,265) · Lowest
    median: HR ($57,393) · Gap: $25,872". The background is white with a very light
    gray (#FAFAFA) plot area. Horizontal y-axis grid lines are visible in subtle gray.
    A legend with colored squares and department names is positioned at the bottom,
    spanning the full width in a single row.'
