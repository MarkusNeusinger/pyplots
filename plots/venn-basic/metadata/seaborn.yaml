review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of white background badges for count labels ensuring readability
    against all overlap colors
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate colorblind-safe palette (Set2)
  - Correct mathematical calculation of all exclusive region counts using inclusion-exclusion
    principle
  - Realistic and relatable data context (developer language preferences survey)
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Good canvas utilization with square aspect ratio appropriate for symmetric Venn
    diagrams
  weaknesses:
  - Missing np.random.seed(42) call for reproducibility consistency across the codebase
  - Could benefit from showing percentages alongside counts as mentioned in spec notes
