review:
  strengths:
  - Effectively communicates the drilldown concept with side-by-side pie charts and
    connecting arrow
  - Excellent breadcrumb navigation and back button UI elements
  - Good colorblind-safe palette on main chart, appropriate sequential blues for drilldown
  - Clean, professional layout with clear visual hierarchy
  - Percentage and dollar value labels on all slices enhance readability
  - Click to drill down annotation clearly indicates interactivity concept
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is used only for theming and color palettes; core visualization uses matplotlib
    pie() - this is a library limitation since seaborn does not have a native pie
    chart function
  - 'Some percentage labels in smaller slices (Books: 5.6%) appear cramped within
    the slice'
  - Only demonstrates one drilldown path (North America); spec suggests showing navigation
    capability more fully
