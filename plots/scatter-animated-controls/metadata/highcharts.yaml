review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style animation with play/pause and timeline
    slider controls
  - Clean, professional visual design with proper colorblind-safe palette
  - Well-structured custom JavaScript for animation logic with smooth transitions
  - Proper use of Highcharts bubble chart with size encoding for population
  - Realistic country development data scenario matching the spec inspiration
  weaknesses:
  - Year displayed in two places (subtitle and control panel) - slightly redundant
  - Right side of chart has unused space (x-axis max 100,000 but data only reaches
    ~80,000)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a Gapminder-style animated bubble chart with
    GDP per Capita (USD) on the x-axis (ranging from $0 to $80,000+) and Life Expectancy
    (Years) on the y-axis (ranging from 40 to 90). The chart displays 20 countries
    as bubbles, color-coded by 4 regions: Region 1 (blue), Region 2 (yellow), Region
    3 (purple), and Region 4 (cyan). Bubble sizes represent population. The title
    correctly shows "scatter-animated-controls · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle
    displaying "Year: 2000". At the bottom, there''s a control panel with a blue "▶
    Play" button, a "Year:" label, a timeline slider, and the current year "2000"
    displayed in blue. The legend is positioned horizontally at the top. The overall
    layout is clean with a white background and subtle grid lines.'
