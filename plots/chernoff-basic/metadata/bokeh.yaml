review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Chernoff faces concept with clear visual differentiation
    between sectors
  - Smart use of realistic business context (Tech/Retail/Energy companies with meaningful
    metrics)
  - Clean grid layout that maximizes canvas utilization with balanced spacing
  - Good color accessibility with distinct, colorblind-safe palette
  - Helpful feature mapping subtitle that aids interpretation
  - Proper normalization of data as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function which violates the KISS principle (should be inline
    code)
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like ColumnDataSource or hover tooltips
    for interactivity
  - Subtitle text at 18pt is slightly small for the 4800×2700 canvas - consider 20pt+
