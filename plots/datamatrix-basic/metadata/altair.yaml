review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements the Data Matrix ECC 200 structure with L-shaped finder and
    alternating timing patterns
  - Clean, high-contrast black and white rendering appropriate for barcode scanning
  - Proper quiet zone implementation (2 modules)
  - Deterministic pattern generation from content hash ensures reproducibility
  - Correct use of Altair declarative approach with mark_rect for grid visualization
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Small visible gaps between cells (stroke=None may not fully eliminate gaps at
    some zoom levels)
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - barcode could be slightly larger relative
    to the total canvas
  - Does not demonstrate interactive features that Altair provides (tooltips showing
    cell coordinates, etc.)
  image_description: The plot displays a 16x16 Data Matrix 2D barcode rendered as
    a grid of black and white rectangular cells using Altair's mark_rect. The title
    "datamatrix-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text
    (approximately 28pt). The barcode features the characteristic L-shaped finder
    pattern with solid black borders on the left and bottom edges, while the top and
    right edges show the alternating (clock) timing pattern. A white quiet zone of
    2 modules surrounds the matrix. The data area contains a deterministic pseudo-random
    pattern representing "SERIAL:12345678". The visualization uses pure black (#000000)
    and white (#FFFFFF) for maximum contrast, with no axes, grid, or legend displayed.
    The square format (approximately 3600x3600 px) is appropriate for this barcode
    visualization.
