review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent toggle UI design with clear visual distinction between selected/unselected
    states
  - Good use of PIL for compositing multiple pygal charts into a single image
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with Python branding colors
  - Realistic data scenario (technology company budget allocation)
  - HTML output provides true interactivity with working toggle functionality
  - Clean code structure with well-organized hierarchy data
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Treemap view is completely empty/missing in the PNG output - the treemap.render_to_png()
    call may have failed or the chart was not properly populated'
  - Sunburst text labels are too long and overlap within the pie segments, making
    them difficult to read
  - The implementation shows both views side-by-side rather than a true toggle, but
    treemap side is blank
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a composite image at 4800x2700 pixels with a main title "hierarchy-toggle-view · pygal · pyplots.ai" in Python blue (#306998) at the top center, followed by a gray subtitle "Technology Company Budget Allocation". Below the title is a toggle switch UI element showing two buttons: "Treemap" (selected, highlighted in blue) and "Sunburst" (unselected, white background).

    The left side is labeled "Treemap View" but the treemap chart is completely empty/missing - only the title text is visible with no actual treemap visualization rendered. The right side shows "Sunburst View" with a donut chart (pie chart with inner_radius=0.4) displaying four department segments: Engineering (blue, ~38%), Sales (yellow, ~28%), Operations (green, ~20%), and HR (orange, ~16%). Each segment contains detailed text showing department totals and sub-department breakdowns (e.g., "Engineering ($155M)Frontend: 45, Backend: 55..."). Both views have legends at the bottom with four colored squares for Engineering, Sales, Operations, and HR.

    The colorblind-safe palette uses Python Blue (#306998), Python Yellow (#FFD43B), Sea Green (#2E8B57), and Burnt Orange (#E07B39).
