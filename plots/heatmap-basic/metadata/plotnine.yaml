review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with idiomatic layer composition
    (geom_tile + geom_text)
  - Smart conditional text coloring via scale_color_identity ensures readability across
    all cell backgrounds
  - Clear data storytelling with recovery trend from negative (blue) to positive (gold)
    across quarters
  - Custom diverging palette (steel blue to off-white to gold) with well-chosen midpoint=0
  - Deliberate extreme values (HR -32.5%, Sales +38.2%) create visual focal points
  - Realistic neutral business scenario with plausible growth rate values
  - 'All spec requirements met: diverging colormap, cell annotations, colorbar, logical
    ordering'
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size 22pt slightly under the 24pt guideline for optimal readability
    at full resolution
  - Mid-range color contrast could be stronger — values near zero on off-white background
    are less visually distinct
  - Code uses nested loops for matrix construction where vectorized numpy operations
    could be more concise
  - Categorical axis labels Quarter and Department lack units (though units are not
    natural for categories)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x8 heatmap titled "Quarterly Growth by
    Department · heatmap-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Year-over-year
    growth rate (%) across departments, Q1 2023 – Q4 2024". The Y-axis lists eight
    departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR, Research,
    Support) and the X-axis shows eight quarters (Q1 ''23 through Q4 ''24, rotated
    45 degrees). Each cell is colored using a diverging scheme: steel blue for negative
    values, off-white/cream for near-zero, and gold/amber for positive values. Every
    cell contains a bold annotation showing the growth rate with a sign prefix (e.g.,
    "-32.5", "+38.2"). A vertical colorbar legend on the right labeled "Growth (%)"
    shows the scale from approximately -20 to +40. The overall layout has a light
    gray (#fafafa) background, white cell borders separating tiles, and no grid lines.
    The data tells a clear recovery story: the left columns are predominantly blue
    (negative growth) transitioning to gold (positive growth) on the right. Notable
    extremes include HR at -32.5% in Q1 ''23 (deepest blue) and Sales at +38.2% in
    Q4 ''24 (deepest gold). Text contrast is managed with white text on dark blue
    cells, dark gray on mid-range cells, and dark brown/amber on bright gold cells.'
