review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of strip plot using pygal XY chart with manual jitter
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good transparency handling for overlapping points
  - Realistic survey score scenario with varied distributions per department
  - Proper title format and well-balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme uses only 2 distinct colors (blue/yellow) for 4 categories, making
    Engineering/Sales and Marketing/Support visually indistinguishable without legend
  - Axis labels lack units (could be Survey Score 1-10 for clarity)
  image_description: The plot displays a strip plot with four department categories
    (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support) on the x-axis and Survey Score (ranging
    from approximately 3.5 to 10) on the y-axis. Points are scattered with horizontal
    jitter within each category to show distribution density. Engineering and Sales
    use blue (#306998) colored dots, while Marketing and Support use yellow/gold (#FFD43B)
    colored dots. The title "strip-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the
    top. Y-axis gridlines are visible with subtle dotted lines. A legend at the bottom
    shows all four categories with their respective colors. The plot has a clean white
    background with good use of transparency (alpha ~0.65) to handle overlapping points.

        comment: Dots are appropriately sized (dots_size=12) with good transparency
          (0.65). Some overlap in dense regions but points remain distinguishable.

        comment: Blue and yellow provide good contrast but using only 2 distinct colors
          for 4 categories reduces clarity (Engineering/Sales both blue, Marketing/Support
          both yellow).

        comment: Shows different distributions per category with varying means and
          spreads. Support shows wider spread, Sales tighter clustering. Could benefit
          from more visible outliers.

        comment: 1-10 scale is appropriate for survey scores. 40 points per category
          is reasonable though some clipping to range limits reduces natural distribution
          appearance.

          Could leverage more pygal-specific features like tooltips or value formatters.
