review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly.express built-in marginal distribution feature (px.scatter
    with marginal_x/marginal_y)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output (title 32pt, axis labels 24pt, ticks 18pt)
  - Good marker styling with appropriate opacity (0.65) and edge outline
  - Consistent color scheme between scatter markers and histogram bars
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Well-aligned marginal plots with main scatter area
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or more descriptive context
  - Could use a more realistic data scenario instead of abstract random data
