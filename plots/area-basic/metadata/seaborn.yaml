review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper font sizes, color choices, and layout
  - Realistic website traffic data with weekly patterns and upward trend effectively
    demonstrates the area chart strength in showing magnitude over time
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Proper use of semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.4) as recommended in spec
  - Y-axis starting at 0 correctly emphasizes the cumulative magnitude
  weaknesses:
  - The implementation uses matplotlib fill_between for the area rather than exploring
    seaborn native capabilities (though seaborn lacks a dedicated area chart function)
  - 'Grid legend scoring: single series plots could benefit from a subtle annotation
    or data source note'
