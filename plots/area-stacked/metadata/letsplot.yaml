review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle with clear data generation logic
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar with proper stacking via position=stack
  - Good color palette with distinct, visually pleasing colors (blue, yellow, green,
    crimson)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good seasonality pattern in data makes the visualization more realistic and engaging
  - Y-axis starts at zero as required for stacked area charts to avoid misleading
    proportions
  - Produces both PNG and HTML outputs for maximum utility
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are barely visible, making it harder to read exact values; consider
    increasing grid alpha
  - Color palette includes red-green combination which may be challenging for colorblind
    users; consider using a fully colorblind-safe palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing monthly revenue
    by product category over a 2-year period (Jan 2023 to Dec 2024). Four categories
    are stacked: Electronics (blue, bottom), Clothing (yellow), Home & Garden (green),
    and Sports (crimson/red, top). The chart uses smooth filled areas with white borders
    between layers, showing clear seasonal patterns with peaks around early spring
    months. The y-axis shows "Revenue (Thousands USD)" ranging from 0 to 220, and
    the x-axis shows "Month" with five labeled time points. A legend on the right
    identifies each category. The title "area-stacked · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, geom_area with position="stack", scale_fill_manual,
          theme_minimal customization. Could leverage more lets-plot specific features
          like tooltips or interactive capabilities for HTML output.
  verdict: APPROVED
