review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-scaled fonts for the 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect title format matching specification requirements
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that clearly demonstrates line plot purpose
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Includes both PNG and HTML outputs, leveraging Plotly dual output capability
  - Custom hovertemplate enhances interactivity in HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (current alpha 0.1 is quite subtle)
  - Could leverage more distinctive Plotly features like spike lines, range selector,
    or annotations
