review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the spec fallback requirement for non-animated libraries
    using faceted display
  - Good Gapminder-style data with realistic country metrics over time
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with appropriate scales and theming
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses letsplot instead of canonical lets-plot library name
  - Point sizes could be larger for better visibility in the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Some smaller countries points are hard to distinguish in early time panels
