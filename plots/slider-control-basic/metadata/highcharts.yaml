review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent slider widget design with clear labels, gradient styling, and prominent
    current value display
  - Clean title format following spec requirements exactly
  - Good data generation with realistic yearly growth trends and seasonal patterns
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe color palette
  - Responsive slider interaction that shows/hides series appropriately
  - Professional-looking chart with appropriate text sizes for the canvas size
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled; would be clearer to show a small legend indicating the currently
    selected year
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (alpha is 0.12 which is good, but visual weight
    is noticeable)
  - The line color shown (brownish-red) differs from the blue (#306998) assigned to
    2023 - appears series colors are not rendering as expected
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing monthly sales data (January
    through December) for the year 2023. The chart uses a brownish-red line color
    (#8C564B) with circular markers at each data point. The Y-axis shows "Sales (thousands
    USD)" ranging from 0 to 310, with clean gridlines. The X-axis shows month labels.
    A slider control widget is visible at the bottom with a gradient track (blue to
    yellow) allowing selection between years 2019-2023, with "2023" prominently displayed
    below. The title follows the correct format "slider-control-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the interaction.

          could leverage built-in Highcharts range selector or input controls for
          tighter integration
