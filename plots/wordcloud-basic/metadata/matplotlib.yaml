review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data choice: Tech skills survey provides relatable, realistic context
    with good frequency variation'
  - Clean word placement with no overlapping text and good use of prefer_horizontal=0.7
    parameter
  - Proper use of random_state=42 ensures reproducibility
  - Blues colormap provides colorblind-safe visualization with good contrast
  - High resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriate min/max font sizes (20-300)
  weaknesses:
  - Library Features score limited because WordCloud library does most of the work
    rather than matplotlib-specific features
  - Could benefit from slightly more diverse color usage while remaining accessible
