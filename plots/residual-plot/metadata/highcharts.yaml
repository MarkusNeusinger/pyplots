review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including zero line, ±2σ threshold
    bands, and outlier highlighting
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with blue residuals and red/orange for outliers and
    thresholds
  - Realistic housing price prediction context with appropriate data scale
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of Highcharts features including plotLines, multiple series with different
    markers, and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible for better readability
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot with "residual-plot · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" as the title. The x-axis shows "Fitted Values ($)" ranging from
    about 150k to 550k, and the y-axis shows "Residuals ($)" ranging from about -60k
    to 120k. Blue circular markers represent regular residuals scattered around a
    blue horizontal zero line labeled "Zero Line (Perfect Fit)". Red diamond markers
    indicate outliers (>2σ). Orange dashed horizontal lines at approximately ±58k
    mark the +2σ and -2σ thresholds. A legend in the top right corner shows "Residuals"
    (blue circle) and "Outliers (>2σ)" (red diamond). The data shows residuals randomly
    scattered around zero with no obvious pattern, indicating a good model fit. There
    are 5 outliers visible - 3 above the +2σ threshold and 2 below the -2σ threshold.
