review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data design clearly demonstrates clustering patterns and gaps
  - Creative use of line-ns marker symbol to create vertical tick marks
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis label with units
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good hover template for interactivity
  - Appropriate semi-transparency for overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical grid lines on y-axis are unnecessary for a 1D rug plot and add visual
    clutter
  - The rug ticks could be slightly taller/more prominent given the large canvas size
  - Could leverage Plotly distinctive features more (e.g., combine with histogram/kde,
    use animations, or add more interactive features)
