review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with geom_bar for automatic counting
  - Smart use of geom_text with stat="count" and ..count.. to display values above
    bars
  - Clean minimal theme with vertical grid lines removed for bar chart clarity
  - Proper categorical ordering using pd.Categorical maintains logical sequence
  - Good use of scale_y_continuous expand parameter to make room for count labels
  - Realistic customer satisfaction survey scenario perfectly demonstrates count plot
    use case
  weaknesses:
  - Horizontal grid lines could use lower alpha for more subtle appearance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing customer satisfaction
    ratings. Five blue bars (#306998) represent categories from left to right: "Excellent"
    (45), "Good" (78), "Average" (52), "Poor" (23), and "Very Poor" (12). Each bar
    has its count value displayed above it in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled
    "Customer Satisfaction Rating" and the Y-axis is labeled "Number of Responses"
    with values ranging from 0 to 90. The title "count-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left in bold. The plot uses a minimal theme with only horizontal
    grid lines visible, creating a clean appearance.'
