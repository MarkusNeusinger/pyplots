review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including the formula, shaded
    zones, optimal point marker, and direct curve labels
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, BoxAnnotation for zones,
    Span for optimal line, Label for annotations'
  - Clean color scheme with good contrast between all four curves
  - Well-sized text elements that are all readable at full resolution
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for this theoretical plot, unitless may be acceptable)
  - Irreducible Error label text appears somewhat faint due to gray color on light
    background
  - Could benefit from HoverTool for interactivity (though this is PNG export)
  image_description: 'The plot displays the classic Bias-Variance Tradeoff visualization
    with four distinct curves on a light gray background. The blue curve (Bias²) starts
    high around 4 on the left and decreases asymptotically as model complexity increases.
    The yellow/gold curve (Variance) starts near zero and increases as complexity
    grows. The gray dashed horizontal line represents Irreducible Error at approximately
    0.5. The red curve (Total Error) shows the characteristic U-shape, being the sum
    of all components. A green vertical dashed line marks the optimal complexity point
    around x=3.2 where total error is minimized, with a green circular marker at that
    intersection. The plot includes shaded regions: a blue-tinted area on the left
    labeled "Underfitting (High Bias)" and a yellow-tinted area on the right labeled
    "Overfitting (High Variance)". The formula "Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible
    Error" appears near the top. Each curve has direct labels. The legend in the top-right
    shows all four series. Axes are labeled "Model Complexity" (x-axis) and "Prediction
    Error" (y-axis). The title correctly follows the format "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai".'
