review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with deterministic data
  - Proper title format and x-axis labeling with units
  - Realistic meta-analysis data with variety in effect sizes and some CIs crossing
    null effect
  - Good use of color contrast between study markers (blue) and pooled estimate (yellow)
  - Y-axis labels include study names with CI values for reference
  weaknesses:
  - CI lines extend across the full plot width instead of just between lower and upper
    CI bounds
  - Pooled estimate uses a circular marker instead of the diamond shape required by
    specification
  - Marker sizes are uniform instead of being proportional to study weights
  - Horizontal whisker implementation not rendering correctly in pygal XY chart
