review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of CO2 data as realistic, scientifically meaningful time series
    example
  - All four decomposition components (Original, Trend, Seasonal, Residual) are clearly
    displayed and distinguishable
  - Good color differentiation between components (blue, yellow, green, red)
  - Appropriate use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for actual decomposition
  - Title follows correct spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  - Date labels shown only on bottom chart prevents clutter
  - HTML output provides interactive SVG version as bonus
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels in the rendered image show Value instead of the intended descriptive
    labels with units
  - Code complexity is higher than KISS ideal due to multi-chart combining via PIL/cairosvg
    (pygal limitation for subplots)
  - Y-axis tick labels are slightly small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas size
