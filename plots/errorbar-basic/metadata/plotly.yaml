review:
  strengths:
  - Clear, publication-quality visualization with excellent text legibility at all
    sizes
  - Error bars have prominent caps (width=16) making error ranges clearly visible
  - Realistic experimental scenario with control and treatment groups
  - Appropriate marker sizing (28) with clean border styling
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Only demonstrates symmetric error bars; could show asymmetric errors to better
    showcase the plot type capabilities
  - Legend could be positioned better (currently overlaps with potential data area
    in top-left)
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates showing exact
    values
