review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with professional 3D metallic gauge border using gradient
    backgrounds
  - Proper use of Highcharts gauge-specific features (plotBands, dial customization,
    pane configuration)
  - Clear color zone differentiation for threshold indication (green/yellow/red)
  - Large, readable value display (67%) in the center
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Produces both interactive HTML and static PNG outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme uses red-green combination which may be challenging for colorblind
    users
  - Tick mark labels are somewhat small relative to the overall gauge size
  - Static image does not visually indicate the realtime dynamic nature (no motion
    blur or multiple needle positions as suggested in spec)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circular gauge chart with a speedometer-style
    design. The gauge has three distinct color zones around its perimeter: green (0-50),
    yellow (50-80), and red (80-100), representing CPU usage thresholds. A blue needle
    points to the current value of 67%, positioned in the yellow warning zone. The
    gauge has a metallic 3D border with gradient effects creating a beveled appearance.
    The center displays "67%" in large blue text. Tick marks and numbers are visible
    around the gauge face, with the title "gauge-realtime · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    at the top and subtitle "CPU Usage Monitor - Live Dashboard Simulation" below
    it. The overall layout uses a white background with the gauge centered in the
    canvas.'
