review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves algorithm using Fourier basis functions
  - Clean visualization that clearly shows Setosa species separation from Versicolor/Virginica
  - Proper normalization with StandardScaler prevents dominant variables
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4) for 150 overlapping curves reveals density
    patterns
  - X-axis uses mathematically meaningful tick labels (-π, -π/2, 0, π/2, π)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing np.random.seed(42) in code (though Iris dataset is deterministic, best
    practice is to include it)
  - Linewidth=1.5 is slightly below recommended 2-4 for high-resolution plots per
    library guidelines
  - Legend sample lines use alpha=0.8 while actual curves use alpha=0.4, creating
    visual inconsistency
  image_description: 'The plot shows Andrews curves visualization using the Iris dataset
    with 150 observations (50 per species). Three distinct colors are used: blue (#306998)
    for Setosa, yellow (#FFD43B) for Versicolor, and coral/pink (#E06C75) for Virginica.
    The x-axis displays t values from -π to π in radians with clear labels at -π,
    -π/2, 0, π/2, π. The y-axis shows f(t) values ranging approximately from -4 to
    5. The title "andrews-curves · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top.
    A legend in the upper right identifies the three species. The curves clearly show
    Setosa (blue) clustering distinctly from the other two species, demonstrating
    good separation, while Versicolor (yellow) and Virginica (coral) overlap significantly
    but have some separation in certain regions. A subtle dashed grid (alpha=0.3)
    aids readability.'
