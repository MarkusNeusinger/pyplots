review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with thick lines and large markers appropriate for the
    4800x2700 canvas
  - Color coding by direction (blue=increase, yellow=decrease) matches spec requirement
    and is colorblind-safe
  - Endpoint labels are well-formatted showing both entity name and value
  - Proper title format following pyplots convention
  - Clean, readable code structure following library guidelines
  - Correct Selenium/headless Chrome export pattern for Highcharts
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 0 but data ranges from 45-150, wasting vertical space that could
    better show the slope differences
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower opacity) to avoid competing with data
  - No explicit comment about deterministic data (minor)
