review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent minimalist sparkline design with no axes or labels as specified
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition (line + endpoint markers + highlight
    points)
  - Realistic business data scenario with weekend dips pattern
  - Appropriate compact aspect ratio (~5:1)
  - Colorblind-safe color choices (blue/yellow/gray)
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas height creates more whitespace than necessary for compact sparkline aesthetic
  - Data trend is monotonically increasing - adding a period of decline would better
    demonstrate sparkline ability to show varied trends
