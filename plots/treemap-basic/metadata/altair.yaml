review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual treemap layout algorithm that correctly calculates strip widths
    and stacked heights
  - Smart label filtering based on rectangle area prevents visual clutter
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette with Python blue (#306998) for the primary
    category
  - Realistic market capitalization data that demonstrates the treemap concept perfectly
  - Clean code structure with good separation of concerns (data → layout → visualization)
  - Interactive tooltips showing sector, company, and formatted market cap values
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio with scale_factor=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend font sizes could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - No visual indication of hierarchy depth through color shading/intensity as mentioned
    in spec notes
