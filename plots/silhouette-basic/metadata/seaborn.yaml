review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of silhouette plot with proper sorted bars within each
    cluster
  - Clear visualization with three distinct clusters showing varying cluster quality
  - Good use of Iris dataset as realistic, well-known clustering example
  - Per-cluster average annotations provide valuable insight for cluster comparison
  - Red dashed average line serves as effective reference point
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Professional title formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Per-cluster average annotations use fixed x-position (0.92) instead of being relative
    to data or axes transform - could be cut off with different data ranges
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific plotting functions (primarily uses matplotlib
    barh with seaborn styling)
  - All silhouette scores are positive; demonstrating some negative scores would better
    showcase the plot's ability to identify misclassified samples
  image_description: The plot displays a silhouette plot with 3 clusters visualized
    using horizontal bars. Cluster 0 (steel blue) is at the bottom with samples ranging
    from ~0.05 to ~0.55 silhouette scores. Cluster 1 (golden yellow) in the middle
    shows the best clustering with scores ranging from ~0.55 to ~0.88. Cluster 2 (green)
    at the top has moderate scores from ~0.30 to ~0.70. A red dashed vertical line
    marks the overall average silhouette score at 0.553. Per-cluster averages are
    annotated on the right side (0.417, 0.798, 0.451). The title correctly displays
    "silhouette-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". X-axis shows "Silhouette Coefficient"
    (0.0-1.0), Y-axis shows "Samples (grouped by cluster)". A legend in the lower
    right identifies each cluster and the average line.

        comment: Uses sns.despine() for seaborn styling, but core plotting uses matplotlib
          barh directly rather than seaborn plotting functions; this is necessary
          since seaborn doesn't have a native silhouette plot function, but limits
          seaborn's distinctive contribution
  verdict: APPROVED
