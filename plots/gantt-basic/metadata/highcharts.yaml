review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts xrange series type for Gantt chart implementation
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with distinct category colors
  - Well-implemented Today marker with red plotLine and label
  - Professional project management scenario with realistic task names and durations
  - Good typography scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Proper category-based legend with series per category
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols are relatively small compared to the large canvas
  - Could add task duration in tooltip for enhanced interactivity
  - Left margin (420px) is slightly larger than necessary
