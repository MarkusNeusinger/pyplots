review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of 100% stacked area using StackedLine with fill=True
  - Excellent title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-chosen, realistic market share scenario with clear temporal trends
  - Good color palette with five distinguishable colors
  - Clean KISS code structure with no unnecessary complexity
  - Properly outputs both PNG and HTML formats
  - Custom style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range starts at ~40 instead of 0, which can be misleading for percentage
    visualization where the full 0-100% context matters
  - Data is somewhat artificial with perfectly linear trends and static values (Accessories
    at exactly 4% for all years)
