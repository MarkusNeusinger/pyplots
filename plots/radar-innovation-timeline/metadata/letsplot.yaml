review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choice with real, recognizable technology names and plausible ring
    assignments
  - Ring background fills with green-to-pink color progression create effective visual
    metaphor for urgency/readiness
  - 'Clean visual design: all chart chrome removed, subtle boundary lines, well-chosen
    pastel ring fills'
  - 270-degree arc layout leaves space for legend as spec suggests
  - Solid code structure with clear sectioning and reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Multiple label overlaps degrade readability, especially in crowded inner rings
    and at sector boundaries (Quantum ML/Neuro-symbolic AI, RAG Pipelines/AI Code
    Review, WebAssembly/Adopt)
  - Item label font size (7) is too small relative to the chart — increasing to 8-9
    would improve readability
  - Significant blank space at bottom of canvas between chart and legend; the chart
    could be vertically centered or the legend moved closer
  - Color mapping in scale_color_manual provides values in wrong order — should use
    a named mapping or match data-appearance order to ensure Sustainability gets green
    and Biotech gets purple as intended
  - Ring labels along the right spoke could be more prominent or placed along the
    inner ring edges for better association with their respective rings
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree radial innovation radar on a
    white background. Four concentric rings represent time horizons: Adopt (inner,
    light green fill), Trial (light yellow fill), Assess (light orange fill), and
    Hold (outer, light pink/red fill). Ring boundaries are drawn as light gray arcs,
    and ring labels ("Adopt", "Trial", "Assess", "Hold") appear in italic along the
    rightmost spoke. Five gray radial spokes divide the chart into four equal sectors,
    each with a bold header label along the outer edge: "AI & ML" (upper-left), "Infrastructure"
    (upper-right), "Sustainability" (lower-left), and "Biotech" (lower-right). Twenty-four
    colored dots are placed within their respective ring-sector intersections, each
    with a radially offset text label. Colors are: blue for AI & ML, purple for Sustainability,
    orange for Biotech, and teal/green for Infrastructure. A legend at the very bottom
    maps "Sector" colors to categories. The title "radar-innovation-timeline · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top-left. The bottom ~25% of the square canvas
    is blank (the open portion of the 270-degree arc), with the legend isolated at
    the bottom edge.'
