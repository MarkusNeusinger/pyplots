review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with white background boxes ensuring readability against
    all overlay colors
  - Mathematically correct implementation using inclusion-exclusion principle for
    region counts
  - Good use of seaborn Set2 colorblind-safe palette and styling context
  - Clear labeling with both counts and percentages in each region
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Minor asymmetry in external label positioning (manual -0.3 offsets for bottom
    labels)
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features (seaborn has no native Venn support,
    so matplotlib patches are required)
