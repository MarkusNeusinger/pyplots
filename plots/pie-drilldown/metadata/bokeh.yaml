review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (CustomJS callbacks, TapTool) for
    drilldown navigation
  - Well-structured hierarchical data model with 4 levels of expense categories
  - Clean code organization with proper ColumnDataSource usage
  - Realistic business expense breakdown scenario with plausible dollar values
  - Proper dual output (HTML for interactivity, PNG for static preview)
  - Good pie chart sizing and label placement
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical color issue: The wedges are drawn in a loop but only one slice shows
    distinct color - 3 of 4 slices appear as nearly identical gray, making the chart
    categories indistinguishable'
  - Static PNG does not show the breadcrumb navigation that exists in HTML version
  - No visual indicator in static image that slices are clickable (spec requirement)
