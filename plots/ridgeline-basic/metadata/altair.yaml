review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair transform_density and row faceting with negative spacing
    to achieve the ridgeline effect
  - Realistic monthly temperature data with appropriate seasonal variation and realistic
    variability patterns
  - Clean color gradient using the blues scheme that naturally emphasizes the seasonal
    progression
  - Perfect title format following spec requirements
  - Well-tuned overlap (-25px spacing) creates visually appealing ridge effect
  - Good font sizing throughout for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines extend across the full width creating slight visual noise on the right
    side where there is no data
  - Grid could be disabled entirely as it does not add value to this visualization
