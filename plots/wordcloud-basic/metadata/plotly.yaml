review:
  strengths:
  - Clean manual positioning algorithm that prevents word overlap while maintaining
    cloud-like appearance
  - Excellent color palette using Python branding colors (blues, yellows, grays)
  - Proper use of Plotly hover functionality showing word and frequency on hover
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Well-structured code with clear comments explaining each section
  - Good font size scaling that creates clear visual hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates or annotations
  - Color palette has multiple similar blue shades that could be more distinctive
  image_description: 'The word cloud displays 28 programming language names on a white
    background. Words are sized proportionally to their frequency, with "Python",
    "JavaScript", "SQL", and "HTML" appearing largest. The color palette uses Python-themed
    colors: various blues (#306998, #4B8BBE, #5A9BD5), yellows (#FFD43B, #FFE873),
    and grays (#646464, #7F7F7F). Words are distributed across the canvas with larger
    words in the center-top area and smaller words around the edges. The title "wordcloud-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in blue. All text is clearly
    legible with no overlapping elements.'
