review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data storytelling: dual bar+line layers combined with threshold lines
    and vertical markers create an immediately comprehensible narrative about PCA
    component selection'
  - Uses real Wine dataset from sklearn rather than synthetic data, producing authentic
    variance distributions
  - Clean, well-proportioned visual design with intentional color hierarchy (blue
    for data, warm colors for thresholds)
  - All text sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Code is clean and well-structured following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Library mastery could be improved by leveraging more distinctive lets-plot features
    (e.g., geom_segment for threshold annotations, or tooltip interactivity in the
    HTML output)
  - The elbow point (where diminishing returns begin) could be annotated for better
    spec compliance
  - Threshold label positioning at x=13 with hjust=1 works but could be more elegantly
    placed
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA on the Wine dataset with 13 principal components. A dark blue (#306998)
    line with circular markers shows the cumulative variance rising from ~36% at component
    1 to ~100% at component 13, following the classic elbow pattern. Light steel blue
    (#B0C4DE) semi-transparent bars underneath show individual variance per component,
    decreasing from ~36% (component 1) to near 0% (component 13). Two horizontal dashed
    reference lines mark the 90% threshold (orange, #E07A3A) and 95% threshold (red,
    #C0392B), with labeled text ("90%" and "95%") positioned at the right end. Vertical
    dotted lines in matching colors indicate the component counts where these thresholds
    are reached (component 8 for 90%, component 10 for 95%). Title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". X-axis: "Number of Principal Components" (1-13). Y-axis:
    "Explained Variance (%)" (0-100). Clean minimal theme with light gray horizontal
    gridlines, no vertical gridlines. Layout is well-balanced in 16:9 landscape format.'
