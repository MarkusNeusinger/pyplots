review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper geometric Brownian motion for realistic stock
    data
  - Good color scheme with distinct colors for each series
  - Proper handling of NaN values for early SMA periods (None conversion for pygal)
  - High-resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Both PNG and HTML output for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage distinctive pygal features like custom tooltips, fill options,
    or secondary Y-axis
  - Legend placement in top-left corner could be optimized
  image_description: The plot displays a Simple Moving Average (SMA) chart with four
    lines on a white background. The blue line (Close Price) shows the raw stock price
    data with high volatility, starting around $160, dropping to $125-130 range mid-year,
    then recovering to $155+ before falling again. The yellow line (SMA 20) follows
    the price closely with slight smoothing. The red line (SMA 50) provides more smoothing
    and starts around day 50. The green line (SMA 200) is the smoothest and appears
    only in the final third of the chart starting around day 200. The title "indicator-sma
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The y-axis shows "Price (USD)"
    ranging from ~126 to ~160, and the x-axis shows "Date" with dates from 2025-01-02
    to 2026-01-15 at 45-degree rotation. A legend in the top-left corner identifies
    all four series.
