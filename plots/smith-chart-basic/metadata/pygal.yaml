review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart topology with proper constant R circles
    and X arcs using reflection coefficient formulas
  - Good use of pygal XY chart capabilities with custom styling
  - Realistic RF engineering data context with antenna impedance sweep
  - Clear visual hierarchy with blue boundary, gray grid, red data curve, and yellow
    frequency markers
  - Proper title format following pyplots convention
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs leveraging pygal dual output capability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows 1/3.5/6 GHz as single combined entry instead of three separate frequency
    markers (1 GHz, 3.5 GHz, 6 GHz)
  - Axis labels could include more descriptive RF terminology (e.g., Reflection Coefficient
    Real Part instead of Real(Gamma))
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - the Smith chart appears smaller relative
    to available space
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Smith chart implementation using pygal's XY chart. The visualization shows:
    - A blue unit circle boundary (|Γ|=1) as the outer boundary
    - Gray dashed constant resistance circles (R Grid) radiating from the right side
    - Gray dashed constant reactance arcs (X Grid) curving from the right edge
    - A dark gray horizontal real axis line through the center
    - A red impedance locus curve (Antenna Z(f)) with connected points showing the frequency sweep trajectory
    - Three yellow frequency marker points (1 GHz, 3.5 GHz, 6 GHz) along the impedance curve
    - The title "smith-chart-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top
    - Legend at the bottom showing: |Γ|=1 Boundary, R Grid, X Grid, Real Axis, Antenna Z(f), 1/3.5/6 GHz
    - The chart uses proper Smith chart topology with the center representing matched condition
