review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for accessibility and visual appeal
  - Clean combination of filled contours (geom_contourf) with white contour lines
    (geom_contour) for enhanced readability
  - Proper ggplot2-style grammar implementation with clean, readable code structure
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the output resolution
  - Mathematical demonstration effectively shows contour concept with two Gaussian
    peaks
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context-specific labeling (e.g., for a
    domain application)
  - The data shows a simple two-peak scenario; more complex features like saddle points
    could better demonstrate contour capabilities
  - Grid lines are absent due to theme_minimal; subtle grid could aid value estimation
  image_description: The plot displays a filled contour visualization of two Gaussian
    peaks on a 2D plane. The primary peak is located at approximately (1, 1) shown
    in bright yellow/green colors indicating higher values (~1.0), and a secondary
    smaller peak at approximately (-1, -1) shown in cyan/green indicating moderate
    values (~0.7). The plot uses the viridis colormap transitioning from dark purple
    (low values ~0) through blue, teal, green to yellow (high values). White contour
    lines overlay the filled regions for added clarity. The X-axis is labeled "X Coordinate"
    ranging from -2.5 to 3, and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Coordinate" ranging from
    -2.5 to 3. The title reads "contour-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" and a colorbar
    legend labeled "Value" appears on the right showing the scale from 0 to 0.8+.
    The overall layout is clean with a minimal theme and good proportions.

        comment: Uses ggplot2-style grammar with geom_contourf and geom_contour, scale_fill_viridis,
          and theme_minimal. Good use of lets-plot's grammar of graphics approach,
          but could leverage more interactive features
  verdict: APPROVED
