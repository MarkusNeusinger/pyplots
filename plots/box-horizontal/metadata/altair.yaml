review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with 6 service types showing varied distributions, outliers,
    and realistic response time ranges
  - Categories sorted by median value for easier comparison as recommended in spec
  - Clean implementation with proper Altair encoding types (Q for quantitative, N
    for nominal)
  - Good customization of box plot components (box color, median color, outlier styling)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines which could help readers trace values across the wide x-axis
  - Could leverage Altair interactive() method for tooltip exploration in the HTML
    output
  - Slight excess whitespace on right side due to outlier-extended scale
