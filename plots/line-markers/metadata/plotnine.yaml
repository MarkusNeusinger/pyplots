review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper aesthetic mappings for
    color and shape
  - 'Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Realistic and meaningful data scenario comparing coastal vs inland temperature
    patterns
  - Proper marker and line sizing for visibility at the target resolution
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis displays numeric month values (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5) instead of month
    names (Jan, Feb, etc.) - the month_labels were created but not used on the axis
  image_description: The plot shows a line chart with markers displaying monthly temperature
    data for two weather stations (Coastal Station and Inland Station) over 12 months.
    The Coastal Station is represented by a blue line (#306998) with circular markers,
    while the Inland Station uses a golden-yellow line (#FFD43B) with square markers.
    The X-axis shows "Month" with numeric values from 1-12.5, and the Y-axis shows
    "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately 2-28°C. Both lines follow a seasonal
    pattern peaking in summer months (July-August). The title correctly reads "line-markers
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right side identifies both weather stations.
    The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gridlines.

        comment: Y-axis has units "Temperature (°C)" but X-axis shows "Month" as numeric

        passed: false
        comment: Grid is subtle, but legend title says "Weather Station" while the
          data labels say "Coastal Station"/"Inland Station" - the legend separates
          color and shape into two entries even though they map to the same variable
