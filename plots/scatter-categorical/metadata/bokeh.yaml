review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for the large canvas (48pt title, 36pt axis labels, 28pt
    tick labels)
  - Clean three-cluster visualization with distinct, colorblind-safe colors
  - Good use of Bokeh interactive tools (hover tooltips with formatted values)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Realistic business context (marketing spend vs engagement)
  - Saves both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be better integrated with the plot (currently appears slightly
    isolated in top-right)
  - Could demonstrate alpha transparency more effectively by having some overlapping
    points between categories
  - Library features usage is good but not exceptional (could use linked selections
    or custom hover styling)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical scatter plot with three distinct
    product categories (Product A, Product B, Product C) shown in three different
    colors. Product A (blue, #306998) forms a cluster in the lower-left region with
    Marketing Spend around 15-35 $K and Customer Engagement Scores around 15-40. Product
    B (yellow, #FFD43B) occupies the upper-middle area with Marketing Spend around
    35-65 $K and engagement scores of 55-90. Product C (red/coral, #E74C3C) is positioned
    on the right side with Marketing Spend around 65-100 $K and engagement scores
    of 35-65. The title "scatter-categorical · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. Axis labels are clear: "Marketing Spend ($K)" on x-axis and "Customer Engagement
    Score" on y-axis. A legend in the top-right corner identifies each category. The
    background is a subtle off-white (#fafafa) with dashed grid lines.'

        comment: Markers are well-sized (size=25) with good alpha (0.7) for 150 points;
          white outline helps distinguish overlapping points. Slightly smaller than
          optimal for this point count.

        comment: Good use of canvas space; plot area fills most of the image with
          balanced margins. Legend placement is good but could be slightly better
          integrated.

        passed: true
        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3, dashed). However, the legend appears outside
          the plot area in the margin with small bokeh toolbar icons visible, which
          is slightly distracting.

        comment: Shows three distinct clusters demonstrating categorical grouping
          well. Could show more overlap between categories to demonstrate the utility
          of categorical coloring in ambiguous regions.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, hover tooltips, interactive tools (pan, wheel_zoom,
          box_zoom, reset, save), and exports both PNG and HTML. Good use of Bokeh's
          interactivity, but could leverage more advanced features like linked brushing
          or custom callbacks.
  verdict: APPROVED
