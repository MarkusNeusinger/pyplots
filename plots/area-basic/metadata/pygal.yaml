review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle with hardcoded deterministic
    data
  - Excellent use of pygal Style class for comprehensive visual customization
  - Smart x-label spacing (every 5th day) preventing overlap while maintaining readability
  - Appropriate semi-transparent fill (opacity=0.4) matching spec recommendations
  - Dual output (HTML for interactivity + PNG for static) leveraging pygal native
    SVG capabilities
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario with natural weekly patterns in website traffic
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes in the custom style (72, 48, 42) are significantly larger than the
    library guide recommendations (28, 18, 16) — while the output looks good, it deviates
    from the standard pygal style template
  - Dots could be slightly larger (dots_size=8 is modest for a 4800x2700 canvas) to
    improve data point visibility
  - No gradient fill effect was attempted, even though the spec suggests considering
    it for visual appeal
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart on a white background. A
    single blue-filled area (#306998) with semi-transparent fill (opacity ~0.4) shows
    daily website visitors over 30 days. Blue dots mark each of the 30 data points
    along the line. The Y-axis is labeled "Visitors (per day)" ranging from ~900 to
    ~2,150 with comma-formatted tick labels and horizontal dashed gridlines. The X-axis
    is labeled "Day of Month" with labels shown at days 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and
    30 for readability. The title "area-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top in gray text. A small legend reading "Daily Visitors" appears at the bottom
    left. The data shows a clear upward trend with weekly cycling patterns (dips around
    days 5-7, 13-14, 19-21, 27-28), effectively demonstrating the area chart's strength
    at conveying volume and magnitude over time.
