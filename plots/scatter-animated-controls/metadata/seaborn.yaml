review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of FacetGrid to create a compelling static representation of animation
    frames
  - Well-designed custom color palette with good accessibility
  - Realistic Gapminder-style data with diverse regional growth patterns
  - Clear annotations with region initials on each bubble
  - Proper use of seaborn statistical visualization strengths (size/hue encoding)
  - Appropriate subtitle explaining the static faceted approach
  weaknesses:
  - The large background year text is coded but not visible in rendered output - zorder=0
    may be causing it to render behind grid/background
  - Legend positioning slightly crowds the right-side panels
