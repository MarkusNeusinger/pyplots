review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent funnel visualization using centered horizontal bars with x/x2 encoding
  - Clear value labels with both absolute values and percentages
  - Attractive Python-themed color gradient from blue to yellow
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following the grammar of graphics
  - Proper title format and good text sizing throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from tooltips for enhanced interactivity in the HTML version
  - Middle blue stages (Interest, Consideration, Intent) have subtle color differences
    that could be more distinct
