review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary density plot using plotnine grammar of graphics
    despite no native ternary support
  - Beautiful viridis colormap with proper transparency for overlapping elements
  - Three distinct clusters clearly demonstrate density estimation capabilities
  - Realistic sediment composition context (sand/silt/clay) is scientifically meaningful
  - Well-structured code with clear coordinate transformation logic
  - Grid lines visible beneath density layer as specified
  - White contour lines provide excellent contrast against the viridis heatmap
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses regular dot character instead of middle dot for separator
  - Grid lines use alpha=0.3 which makes them quite faint
  - Tick labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density visualization for sediment
    composition (sand/silt/clay). The triangular plot uses a viridis colormap ranging
    from dark purple (low density) to bright yellow (high density). Three distinct
    density clusters are clearly visible: one in the bottom-left corner (high sand),
    one in the bottom-right area (high silt), and one in the upper-middle region (high
    clay). White contour lines overlay the density heatmap showing density levels.
    The triangle has a blue (#306998) outline with grid lines at 20% intervals visible
    through the semi-transparent density layer. Each vertex is labeled with the component
    name and percentage units: "Sand (%)" at bottom-left, "Silt (%)" at bottom-right,
    and "Clay (%)" at top. Tick labels (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) run along each edge.
    The title "ternary-density · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in
    bold. A "Density" colorbar legend appears on the right side with values ranging
    from approximately 0 to 5.'
