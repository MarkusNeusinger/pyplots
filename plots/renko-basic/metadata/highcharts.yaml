review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe blue/orange palette instead of traditional red/green
  - Proper use of columnrange chart type to represent Renko bricks
  - Well-configured tooltips showing brick price range
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Good use of responsive rules for different screen sizes
  - Clear visual separation between bricks with borders
  - Realistic stock price simulation with appropriate brick size
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines on legend markers appear slightly inconsistent with data visualization
  - Legend styling could be slightly more polished (border width/color)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 70+ bricks
    showing stock price movements from around $84 to $116. Blue bricks represent bullish
    (upward) price movements and orange bricks represent bearish (downward) movements
    - a colorblind-safe palette. The chart starts at ~$100, drops to a low around
    $86, then recovers to peak near $114. The title "renko-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed with a subtitle showing "Stock Price Movement | Brick
    Size: $2". A well-positioned legend in the top-right corner identifies the two
    series. Both axes have clear labels ("Brick Index" and "Price ($)") with dollar
    formatting on the y-axis. A subtle grid helps identify price levels. The bricks
    are uniform in size with clear borders and small gaps between them.'
