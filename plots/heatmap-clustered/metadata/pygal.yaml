review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of clustered heatmap through custom pygal Graph extension
  - Clear clustering patterns with proper dendrograms on both axes
  - Meaningful biological data context with real gene names showing tumor vs normal
    patterns
  - Proper diverging colormap centered at zero with colorbar labeled Z-Score
  - Complete output including PNG, SVG and interactive HTML
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis labels for Genes and Samples dimensions
  - Row dendrogram appears cramped on left side
  - Layout margins could be better utilized
