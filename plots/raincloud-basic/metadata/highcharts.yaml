review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation showing bimodal distribution in Treatment B and varying
    spreads across groups
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color differentiation
  - Clean code structure with inline KDE computation
  - Good use of Highcharts polygon series for custom half-violin shapes
  - Proper boxplot statistics calculation with quartiles and whiskers
  - Realistic experimental scenario (reaction times)
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: The cloud/rain orientation violates the spec - clouds should be on
    the right (or top), rain on the left (or below) for vertical orientation, but
    the implementation has cloud LEFT and rain RIGHT - this is the opposite of rain
    falling from cloud'
  - Legend is not visible within the plot area
  - Marker size could be larger for better visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
