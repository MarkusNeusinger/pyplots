review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn muted color palette creating a cohesive, professional
    look
  - Good realistic tech skills survey context with recognizable industry terms
  - Proper reproducibility with fixed random seeds
  - Clean title formatting following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good canvas utilization with words filling the available space
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a function definition (color_func) violating KISS structure requirement
    for plot implementations
  - Machine Learning and other multi-word terms are split into separate words, losing
    compound meaning
  - No seaborn plotting functions used - only styling; wordcloud library does all
    the work
  - Some minor crowding/near-overlap in the center word cluster
  - Only 40 words when spec suggests 20-200 typical, could demonstrate more of the
    plot capability
