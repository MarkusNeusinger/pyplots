review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with salary distributions across departments
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: median, quartiles, whiskers, outliers all present'
  - Good handling of seaborn 0.14+ API compatibility with hue parameter
  - Clean currency formatting on y-axis improves readability
  - Each department has visually distinct characteristics (different medians, spreads,
    outlier counts)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive features like stripplot overlay, violin
    plots, or statistical annotations
  - Yellow color for Marketing category could have slightly better contrast
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box-and-whisker chart showing salary distributions
    across 5 departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance). Each department
    has a distinctly colored box: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow/gold), Sales
    (green), HR (orange), and Finance (purple). The y-axis shows "Salary ($)" ranging
    from approximately $20K to $160K with currency formatting. The x-axis shows "Department"
    labels. Each box clearly displays the median line, quartile boundaries, whiskers
    extending to 1.5*IQR, and outliers shown as hollow circles. The title correctly
    reads "box-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed horizontal grid helps
    with value reading. The layout is clean with good proportions.'
