review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear color gradients showing parent-child
    relationships
  - Well-designed legend showing department colors and budget totals
  - Clean visual separation between rings using white borders
  - Correct proportional representation where parent segments encompass children angular
    span
  - Ring level labels (Dept, Team, Project) provide helpful context
  - Good use of Label components for annotation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing hover tooltips which would be valuable for a Bokeh sunburst to show exact
    values
  - Some outer ring labels are truncated (e.g., Infra instead of Infrastructure)
  - Colorblind accessibility could be improved - red (Sales) and green (Operations)
    are adjacent
  - Level 1 labels use 3-character abbreviations that may not be immediately clear
    (Eng, Mar, Sal, Ope)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sunburst chart showing a company budget
    hierarchy across three concentric rings. The innermost ring shows four departments:
    Engineering (Eng, blue), Marketing (Mar, yellow), Sales (Sal, red), and Operations
    (Ope, green). The middle ring shows teams within each department (Backend, Frontend,
    DevOps, Digital, Content, Enterprise, SMB, Support, HR) in lighter shades of the
    parent colors. The outermost ring shows projects (API, Database, Web App, Mobile,
    Infrastructure, Social Media, SEO, Blog, Video, EMEA, APAC, Direct, Tier 1, Tier
    2, Recruiting) in the lightest shades. A legend on the right shows the department
    color gradients with budget totals. Ring level labels (Dept, Team, Project) appear
    below the chart. The title "sunburst-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top.'
