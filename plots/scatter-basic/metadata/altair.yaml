review:
  strengths:
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (:Q for quantitative)
  - Correct use of configure_axis for consistent styling across the chart
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity in HTML output
  - Proper scale_factor=3.0 for high-resolution PNG output (4800x2700)
  - Good use of filled=True for solid markers and appropriate opacity
  weaknesses:
  - Excessive whitespace on left side of plot (X axis starts at 0 while data starts
    ~4.5) - consider using scale domain or padding
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) - could use a realistic scenario from
    spec applications (e.g., Study Hours, Exam Score)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with approximately 100 data
    points in a blue color (#306998). The title "scatter-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is shown at the top center. The X-axis is labeled "X Value" ranging from 0 to
    14, and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" ranging from 0 to 16. Data points are
    concentrated in the range of x=5-14 and y=3-14, showing a clear positive linear
    correlation. Points have moderate transparency (opacity 0.7) and are filled circles
    of consistent size. A subtle grid (alpha 0.3) helps with value estimation. The
    overall layout is clean with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
