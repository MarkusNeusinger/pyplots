review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal per-bar color styling with gradient mapped to importance
    values
  - Clean visual design with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correct sorting with highest importance at top (pygal renders bottom-to-top, code
    handles this)
  - Value annotations positioned clearly at end of each bar with 3 decimal precision
  - Realistic house price prediction context using recognizable feature names
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function importance_to_color which deviates from strict KISS
    script style
  - X-axis could be tighter to data range to reduce unused whitespace on right side
  image_description: The plot shows a horizontal bar chart of feature importances
    from a house price prediction model. There are 15 features displayed on the y-axis
    (OverallQual at top, ExterQual at bottom), sorted by importance with highest at
    top. The x-axis shows "Importance Score" ranging from 0.000 to 0.240. Bars use
    a gradient from light blue (low importance) to darker Python Blue (high importance).
    Each bar has its importance value displayed at the end (e.g., 0.245 for OverallQual,
    0.182 for GrLivArea). The title reads "bar-feature-importance · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    The layout has white background with subtle vertical grid lines, and all feature
    names are clearly readable on the left side.
