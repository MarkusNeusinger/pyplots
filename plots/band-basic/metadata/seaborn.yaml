review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with perfect text legibility and color accessibility
  - Data demonstrates expanding uncertainty over time, showcasing band plot capabilities
    effectively
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Title format and legend labels are accurate and informative
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.3) allowing visibility of overlapping
    elements
  weaknesses:
  - The fill_between function is from matplotlib rather than a seaborn-specific function;
    while seaborn does not have a native band/fill_between equivalent, the implementation
    correctly uses sns.lineplot for the central line
  image_description: The plot displays a band chart showing a 95% confidence interval
    around a mean trend line. The band is rendered in a semi-transparent light blue
    (#306998 with alpha 0.3), representing the confidence interval that expands over
    time (heteroscedastic behavior). The central trend line is rendered in bright
    yellow/gold (#FFD43B) with a linewidth of 3. The data shows a sinusoidal pattern
    with an upward linear trend, ranging from approximately -1 to 8 on the amplitude
    axis and 0 to 10 on the time axis. The title "band-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is clearly visible at the top. Axis labels "Time (s)" and "Amplitude" are well-sized.
    A legend in the upper left corner identifies both elements. The grid uses subtle
    dashed lines. Overall, the layout is clean and professional with excellent readability.
