review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format and comprehensive subtitle explaining bubble size encoding
  - Bubble legend (bubbleLegend) is a distinctive Highcharts feature well-utilized
  - Realistic tech company scenario with plausible revenue/growth/market cap data
  - All font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of transparency (alpha 0.6) and border highlighting on bubbles
  - Clean linear code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Excessive right margin (spacingRight: 380) and bottom margin (marginBottom: 320)
    waste canvas space, pushing the plot area below the 40% utilization threshold'
  - Single color for all bubbles — adding a categorical color dimension (e.g., sector
    grouping) would enhance data storytelling and spec compliance (spec mentions color
    as optional fourth dimension)
  - The z_scaled normalization creates artificial values (20-100) that appear in the
    bubble legend instead of actual market cap values, making the legend less informative
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific typed Python classes instead of raw dict
    configuration
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with 30 data points on a white
    background. The x-axis shows "Revenue (Billion USD)" ranging from 0 to approximately
    700, and the y-axis shows "Growth Rate (%)" ranging from 0 to 55. All bubbles
    are a semi-transparent steel blue (rgba(48,105,152,0.6)) with darker blue borders.
    Bubble sizes vary significantly — smaller bubbles cluster in the upper-left (low
    revenue, high growth) while larger bubbles appear in the lower-right (high revenue,
    low growth), clearly showing an inverse relationship. A Highcharts bubble legend
    appears on the right side with three reference circles labeled 20.0, 60.0, and
    100.0, along with a "Market Cap" series label. The title "bubble-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is bold and prominent at the top, with subtitle "Bubble size represents
    Market Capitalization" below it. Grid lines are very subtle. The overall layout
    is clean with the plot occupying the majority of the canvas, though the right
    margin is generous to accommodate the bubble legend.
