review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stem plot implementation using creative combination of LineSeries for
    stems and ScatterSeries for markers
  - Clean baseline implementation using plotLines feature
  - Good color choice (#306998) with white marker borders for visibility
  - 'Appropriate data: damped oscillation demonstrates both positive and negative
    stems well'
  - Proper use of container.screenshot() for exact dimensions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Amplitude (a.u.)" or "Sample Index (n)")
  - Image height is 2661px instead of exactly 2700px (minor dimension discrepancy)
