review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom swarm positioning algorithm that creates proper beeswarm spread
  - Clean, realistic data context (employee performance by department)
  - Mean markers add valuable summary statistics as suggested in spec
  - Proper font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good color palette that is accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Performance Score (0-100)")
  - Legend is redundant - departments already labeled on x-axis, only Mean marker
    needs explanation
  - For ~190 data points, marker size s=150 causes some visual density in centers
