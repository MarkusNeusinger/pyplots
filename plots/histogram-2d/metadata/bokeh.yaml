review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density representation
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled text
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Correctly transposed histogram for proper orientation
  - Grid disabled appropriately for heatmap visualization
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) instead of contextual labels with units
  - Could add HoverTool to show bin counts on mouseover for the HTML version
  - Data scenario could be more realistic (e.g., financial returns, physics measurements)
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D histogram heatmap showing the joint distribution
    of two continuous variables. The visualization uses the Viridis colormap (dark
    purple for low density transitioning through blue and green to bright yellow for
    high density). The data clearly shows a positive correlation pattern (diagonal
    band from lower-left to upper-right), consistent with the bivariate normal distribution
    with 0.7 correlation specified in the code. The highest density region (yellow,
    ~45 counts) is centered around (0.5, 0.5). A colorbar labeled "Count" on the right
    indicates density values ranging from 0 to ~45. The title "histogram-2d · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top-left. X-axis is labeled "X Value" (-3.5
    to 3.5), Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" (-3 to 4). Grid lines are appropriately disabled
    for the heatmap. The plot fills the canvas well with good proportions.
