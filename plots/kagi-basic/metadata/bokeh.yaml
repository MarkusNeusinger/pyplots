review:
  strengths:
  - Well-implemented Kagi chart algorithm with proper reversal threshold logic
  - Good line thickness differentiation (12 vs 4 line_width) clearly distinguishes
    yang from yin
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with units
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of Bokeh-specific features (Legend, LegendItem, export_png)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output - placing legend with add_layout(legend,
    right) puts it outside the figure bounds; use location property within figure
    or place legend inside plot area
  - Red-green color scheme in rendered output is not colorblind-safe - use blue/orange
    as originally intended in code comments
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart showing price movements over approximately
    21 Kagi line indices. The chart uses green thick lines for yang (bullish) segments
    and red/salmon thin lines for yin (bearish) segments. The price range spans from
    approximately $78 to $113. Vertical lines show price movements within a trend,
    while horizontal lines connect reversals at trend change points. The title "kagi-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in black text. The x-axis is labeled
    "Kagi Line Index" ranging from 0 to 20, and the y-axis is labeled "Price ($)"
    ranging from approximately 80 to 110. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with
    subtle dashed grid lines at alpha 0.3. The legend is NOT visible in the rendered
    image despite being added in the code - it appears to be placed outside the visible
    canvas area when using add_layout with "right" position.
