review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard-style layout demonstrating non-uniform subplot sizes with
    larger main chart and smaller detail panels
  - Consistent visual styling across all subplots with matching font sizes, grid alpha,
    and outline styling
  - Realistic financial dashboard scenario with coherent data story (price, volume,
    returns analysis)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper use of ColumnDataSource for all data
  - Good color palette using Python blue/yellow theme with accent colors for variety
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom row panels have slight width inconsistency (1500+1500+1600 vs top row)
    creating minor visual imbalance
  - Does not demonstrate rowspan (tall sidebar plot) which is mentioned in the spec
    notes
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific interactive features like linked brushing or
    hover tooltips
  image_description: 'The plot displays a dashboard-style custom subplot grid with
    5 panels. The main title "subplot-grid-custom · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The top row contains two panels: (1) "Price Trend Over Time" - a large
    blue line chart with scatter points showing stock price declining from ~108 to
    ~80 over 100 days, and (2) "Daily Trading Volume" - yellow vertical bars showing
    volume fluctuating between 1-5 million. The bottom row has three smaller panels:
    (1) "Returns Distribution" - a green histogram showing approximately normal distribution
    of daily returns from -6% to +4%, (2) "Sales by Product Category" - blue vertical
    bars for Products A-D with varying heights (45, 72, 38, 65 units), and (3) "Variable
    Correlation Analysis" - coral/red scatter points showing positive correlation.
    All panels have readable axis labels with units, subtle gray grid lines, and gray
    outlines.'
