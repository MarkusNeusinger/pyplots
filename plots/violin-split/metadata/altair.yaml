review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of split violin using transform_density with signed density
    calculation
  - Clean faceted layout that scales well across departments
  - Includes quartile markers (IQR rule + median diamond) as suggested in spec
  - Colorblind-friendly blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Realistic data scenario with varying treatment effects per department
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear at default opacity rather than subtle (alpha 0.2-0.4)
  - The IQR and median markers use xOffset which places them slightly offset from
    violin center rather than overlaid on the violin halves
