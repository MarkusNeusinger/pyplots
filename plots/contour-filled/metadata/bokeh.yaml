review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and visual appeal
  - Smart contour line styling with white base + dark outline for visibility across
    all elevation levels
  - Well-implemented terrain elevation scenario with realistic 0-2000m scale
  - Clean integration of contourpy for precise contour line generation
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt ticks)
  - HoverTool implementation provides interactivity in HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling still somewhat prominent (alpha 0.3 with width 2); could be reduced
    further for cleaner contour visualization
  - Colorbar title is slightly small relative to other text elements
