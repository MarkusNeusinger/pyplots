review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the scatter plot matrix with clear visual separation
    of species clusters
  - Proper use of GridSpec for tight subplot spacing creating a cohesive matrix appearance
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.6 for scatter, 0.7 for histograms) to
    handle overlapping points
  - Clean axis label placement with labels only on edges (left and bottom)
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with good contrast
  - Realistic Iris-like data with biologically plausible parameters
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-right subplot overlaps with scatter data in that cell;
    consider placing legend outside the matrix or in a dedicated area
  - Scatter marker size (s=70) is adequate but could be slightly larger for better
    visibility given the data density
  - Could leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like shared axes linking or
    colorbar for additional encoding
