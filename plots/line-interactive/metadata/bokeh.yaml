review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive tools (WheelZoom, BoxZoom, PanTool, ResetTool)
    with wheel zoom as default active scroll
  - Well-configured HoverTool with vline mode and formatted date/temperature display
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with readable fonts throughout
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data pattern demonstrating time series characteristics
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper ColumnDataSource usage
  - Dual output (HTML for interactivity, PNG for preview) is best practice for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top_left overlaps with data peaks in winter months - consider
    top_right or outside placement
  - Missing RangeSlider or RangeTool widget for quick time range navigation as specified
    in requirements
  - Marker size could be reduced to 6-8 with alpha 0.6 for 365 data points to reduce
    visual clutter
