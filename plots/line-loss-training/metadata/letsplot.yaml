review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of overfitting concept with training/validation loss divergence
  - Clean implementation of optimal stopping point marker with diamond shape and vertical
    dashed line
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with proper theme customization
  - Appropriate color scheme (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-friendly
  - Proper sizing with ggsize(1600, 900) and scale=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are not visible despite using theme_minimal (could add explicit grid
    with alpha for subtle visibility)
  - The legend shows empty string for color label which works but is not ideal practice
