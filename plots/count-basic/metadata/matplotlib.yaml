review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent survey response scenario with realistic Likert scale data
  - Count labels above bars enhance readability as suggested in spec
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed top/right spines
  - Proper frequency-based sorting (descending) as recommended
  - Good use of edge color for bar definition
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features (hatching, gradient fills, or percentage
    annotations)
  - Minor layout inefficiency with extra whitespace on right side
