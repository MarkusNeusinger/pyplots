review:
  strengths:
  - Correct OHLC bar chart structure with proper open/close tick positioning (left/right)
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/orange) for up/down distinction
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool, interactive
    tools'
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial data with appropriate volatility and business day frequency
  weaknesses:
  - Layout balance could be improved - some unused space on right side of canvas
  - HoverTool in vline mode may not provide optimal interaction for OHLC data
  - Could use Bokeh segment glyph more efficiently with source for all three segment
    calls
  image_description: The plot displays an OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) bar chart for
    50 trading days from June to August. Each bar consists of a thin vertical line
    showing the high-low range, with a left horizontal tick for the opening price
    and a right horizontal tick for the closing price. Blue bars indicate up days
    (close >= open) and orange bars indicate down days (close < open). The y-axis
    shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately 130 to 170, and the x-axis shows
    "Date" with labels every 5 trading days (Jun 02, Jun 09, Jun 16, etc.). The title
    "ohlc-bar · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The background is a light
    gray (#fafafa) with dashed grid lines. The price shows a general downward trend
    from ~$150 to ~$135 over the period, with typical daily volatility visible in
    each bar.
