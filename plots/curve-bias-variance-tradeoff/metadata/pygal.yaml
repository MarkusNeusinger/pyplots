review:
  strengths:
  - Clean data generation with correct theoretical bias-variance relationships
  - Good use of pygal custom styling with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Distinct line styles (solid, dashed with different patterns) help differentiate
    curves
  - Proper use of XY chart type for continuous curves
  - Legend correctly identifies optimal complexity point value
  weaknesses:
  - Optimal point marker (dots_size=20) is not clearly visible on the plot - needs
    to be more prominent or use different visualization approach
  - 'Missing formula annotation: Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error
    (spec requirement)'
  - Missing shaded regions to indicate underfitting zone (left) and overfitting zone
    (right) (spec recommendation)
  - Curves are not labeled directly on the plot as recommended in spec - relies solely
    on legend
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a bias-variance tradeoff visualization with four curves on a white background. The title "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in monospace font. The X-axis shows "Model Complexity" ranging from 0.5 to 10, and the Y-axis shows "Prediction Error" ranging from approximately 0 to 4. Four curves are rendered:

    - Bias² (blue dashed line): Decreasing curve starting high (~2.9) at low complexity and asymptotically approaching ~0.5
    - Variance (yellow line): Increasing curve starting near 0 at low complexity and rising to ~3 at high complexity
    - Total Error (red line): U-shaped curve showing minimum around complexity ~3.1
    - Irreducible Error (teal/green solid line): Constant horizontal line at ~0.5

    A legend at the bottom identifies all four curves plus an "Optimal (complexity=3.1)" marker. The curves use dashed line styles for differentiation. Subtle gray grid lines are visible. The optimal point marker is not clearly visible in the plot area (likely too small or obscured).
