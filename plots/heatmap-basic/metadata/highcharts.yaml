review:
  strengths:
  - Explicit font sizing throughout ensures excellent text legibility at 4800x2700
  - Adaptive data label colors (white on dark cells, dark on light) demonstrate good
    attention to readability
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with logical day/time organization
  - Clean white cell borders provide clear visual separation
  - Proper use of Highcharts heatmap module with colorAxis stops
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has excessive whitespace — the right margin (420px) and vertical spacing
    between rows reduce canvas utilization
  - The blue sequential palette lacks sufficient contrast in the mid-range, making
    it hard to visually distinguish cells with values between ~30 and ~60
  - No axis titles ("Day of Week", "Time Period") to provide explicit context
  - The data pattern (weekday business hours peak) could be more pronounced to better
    demonstrate heatmap pattern-detection capability
  - No visual storytelling — annotations, highlighted regions, or stronger color contrast
    could guide the viewer to key insights
  - Color stops could use a wider color range or a more perceptually uniform palette
    for better value discrimination
  image_description: The plot displays a heatmap titled "Website Traffic · heatmap-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai". It shows an 8×7 matrix with days of the week (Mon–Sun)
    on the x-axis and time periods (6–9 AM through 3–6 AM) on the y-axis. Each cell
    contains a numeric value annotation representing visits per hour. The color scheme
    is a sequential blue palette ranging from very light blue/white (low values near
    0) to dark blue (high values near 100). White borders (3px) separate each cell
    cleanly. A vertical color bar legend on the right side is labeled "Visits/hr"
    with a scale from 0 to 100. Data labels adapt their color — white text on darker
    cells (values >60) and dark text on lighter cells — ensuring readability. Late-night
    rows (Mid–3 AM, 3–6 AM) are consistently light, indicating low traffic. Some weekday
    business-hour peaks are visible (e.g., Mon 3–6 PM = 91). The overall layout has
    generous margins, particularly on the right for the legend.

        comment: Blue sequential palette is colorblind-safe, but low-to-mid range
          blues are quite similar, making mid-range distinctions harder.

        comment: Right margin very large (~420px) for legend. Noticeable vertical
          whitespace between rows. Heatmap doesn't fill canvas tightly.

          titles. Colorbar title provides unit context.
