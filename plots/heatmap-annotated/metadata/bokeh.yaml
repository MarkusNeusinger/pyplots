quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast logic (white text on dark cells, black on light)
  - Clean diverging colormap implementation with proper [-1, 1] range
  - Well-structured realistic financial correlation data with meaningful relationships
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and LinearColorMapper
  - Good sizing choices for the square matrix format
  weaknesses:
  - Generic axis labels "Variable" instead of more descriptive labels
  - Colorbar could include more context (e.g., "Pearson Correlation" instead of just
    "Correlation")
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x8 correlation matrix heatmap for financial
    metrics: Revenue, Profit, Assets, Debt, Growth, ROI, Market Cap, and Volume. The
    visualization uses a diverging blue-white-red colormap where dark blue represents
    strong negative correlations (-1), white represents no correlation (0), and dark
    red represents strong positive correlations (+1). Each cell contains a numeric
    annotation showing the correlation coefficient to 2 decimal places. The diagonal
    shows perfect correlations (1.00) in dark red. Notable strong correlations include
    Revenue-Profit (0.82), Revenue-Market Cap (0.58), and ROI-Profit (0.62). The colorbar
    on the right displays the scale with "Correlation" label. X-axis labels are rotated
    at the top of the chart, and both axes are labeled "Variable". The title correctly
    follows the format "heatmap-annotated · bokeh · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and transform correctly, but doesn't leverage
          Bokeh's interactive capabilities (tooltips showing exact values on hover
          would be natural for this use case)
  verdict: APPROVED
