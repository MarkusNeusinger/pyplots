review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world economics example (advertising diminishing returns) that
    naturally demonstrates polynomial regression
  - R² value (0.936) and polynomial equation prominently displayed as spec requires
  - Confidence band adds statistical context beyond minimum requirements
  - Strong color contrast between blue points (#306998) and yellow curve (#FFD43B)
  - 'Proper lets-plot idioms: ggplot grammar, ggsize(1600,900) with scale=3, theme
    customization'
  weaknesses:
  - The geom_ribbon confidence band renders with dark border lines at the edges, which
    appears as two additional gray curves surrounding the yellow polynomial line -
    this is visually distracting
