review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chess board visualization with proper orientation and color scheme
  - Unicode chess symbols render cleanly and are appropriately sized
  - Scholar's Mate is an excellent educational example - a famous, recognizable position
  - Clean use of plotnine's grammar of graphics with layer composition (geom_tile
    + geom_text)
  - Title follows the required format precisely
  - 1:1 aspect ratio is ideal for a chess board
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels have no units, but for chess notation this is acceptable (files are
    letters, ranks are numbers)
  - 'Minor code style: UNICODE_PIECES dictionary is all-caps constant style, which
    deviates slightly from the pure KISS script style'
  image_description: The plot displays a chess board visualization showing the "Scholar's
    Mate" position. The board uses a classic color scheme with light tan (#F0D9B5)
    and brown (#B58863) alternating squares in a standard 8x8 checkerboard pattern.
    The board is oriented correctly with white pieces at the bottom (ranks 1-2) and
    black pieces at the top (ranks 7-8). Files are labeled a-h along the bottom axis
    and ranks 1-8 along the left axis, both in bold text. Unicode chess symbols are
    used for all pieces - white pieces shown as outlined symbols and black pieces
    as filled symbols. The position shows a famous 4-move checkmate with the white
    Queen on f7 delivering checkmate to the black King on e8. The title "Scholar's
    Mate · chessboard-pieces · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold.
    The board has a 1:1 aspect ratio with white background and no grid or legend.
