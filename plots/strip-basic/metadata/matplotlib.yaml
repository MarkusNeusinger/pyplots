review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario using survey scores by department - directly matches spec
    applications
  - Good implementation of jitter (0.2 spread) within spec recommendation (0.1-0.3)
  - Clean visual design with subtle grid and appropriate transparency (0.6)
  - Mean reference lines add value as suggested in spec notes
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=200) for the data density
  - Perfect KISS code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Alternating blue/yellow colors across categories have no semantic meaning - consider
    single color or legend
  - Mean lines lack annotation or legend entry explaining what they represent
  - Y-axis label could include scale range (1-10)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a strip plot showing "Survey Response Score"
    (y-axis, scale 0-10) across four departments (x-axis): Engineering, Marketing,
    Sales, and HR. Each department''s data points are scattered with horizontal jitter
    to avoid overplotting. Engineering and Sales use a blue color (#306998), while
    Marketing and HR use a yellow/gold color (#FFD43B). Black horizontal lines indicate
    the mean score for each group (Engineering ~6.9, Marketing ~6.6, Sales ~7.7, HR
    ~6.2). Points have white edge borders and moderate transparency (alpha 0.6). The
    y-axis grid lines are subtle with dashed styling. The title follows the correct
    format: "strip-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The layout is clean with good
    use of the 16:9 canvas.'

          usage, no advanced features like zorder customization or custom markers
