review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts 3D capabilities including scatter3d chart type and
    3D frame options
  - Viridis colormap implementation provides good color accessibility
  - Custom colorbar drawn using Highcharts renderer API shows advanced library usage
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs are generated
  - Good mathematical example with Gaussian peaks demonstrating surface features
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - The Z-axis (depth) label Y Position (units) is not visible in the rendered view
  - Grid lines could be more visible to aid depth perception in 3D space
  - Library version in header shows unknown instead of actual Highcharts version
  - The wireframe is quite dense in flat areas which can obscure the surface structure
