review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_tile for
    regions, geom_point for data)
  - Clear visual distinction between correctly classified and misclassified points
    using different shapes (circles vs X markers)
  - Good color scheme that is colorblind-accessible (blue/yellow)
  - Proper handling of the SVM decision boundary with appropriate mesh resolution
  - Well-organized legend with separate sections for predicted regions and training
    points
  - Code follows KISS principles with clear, linear structure
  weaknesses:
  - Training point marker colors could have stronger contrast against the background
    regions (both use similar saturation levels)
  - Legend could be more compact to allow more space for the plot area
  - Grid lines completely removed - subtle grid could help with reading exact coordinate
    values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a decision boundary visualization using the
    classic two-moon synthetic dataset. The feature space is divided into two distinct
    regions: a blue region (class 0, #306998) covering the upper-left area and a yellow
    region (class 1, #FFD43B) covering the lower-right area. The boundary between
    regions shows a smooth, nonlinear curve characteristic of an SVM with RBF kernel.
    Training points are overlaid as dark blue circles (class 0) and olive/gold circles
    (class 1) for correctly classified points, while misclassified points are displayed
    with X markers. The title "contour-decision-boundary · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. Axis labels are "Feature X1" (x-axis) and "Feature X2"
    (y-axis). A two-section legend on the right shows "Predicted Region" (0/1) and
    "Training Points" (Class 0, Class 1, Class 0 misclassified, Class 1 misclassified).
    The plot uses a minimal theme with no grid lines.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar (ggplot + geom_tile + geom_point), scale_*_manual,
          theme customization. However, no use of more advanced plotnine features
          like faceting or statistical transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
