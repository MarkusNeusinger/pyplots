review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast with adaptive white/black text based on background intensity
  - Row-normalized percentages provide additional insight beyond raw counts
  - Realistic multi-class classification scenario with plausible confusion patterns
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Square aspect ratio perfect for symmetric confusion matrix
  - Professional colorbar with clear Count label
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage matplotlib-specific advanced features (just uses basic imshow)
  - Grid lines at width=2 are slightly prominent compared to subtle alpha=0.3 guidelines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 confusion matrix heatmap for a multi-class
    classification scenario with classes: Cat, Dog, Bird, and Fish. The diagonal cells
    (correct predictions) are dark blue with high values (85, 78, 88, 90), while off-diagonal
    cells (misclassifications) are lighter shades of blue with lower values. Each
    cell shows both the raw count and the row percentage in parentheses. The y-axis
    is labeled "True Label" and x-axis is labeled "Predicted Label". A colorbar on
    the right shows the "Count" scale from approximately 10 to 90. The title follows
    the required format "confusion-matrix · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Text uses white
    color on dark backgrounds and black on light backgrounds for contrast. X-axis
    labels are rotated 45 degrees. White grid lines separate the cells.'

        comment: Uses basic imshow() for heatmap; could use matplotlib's more advanced
          features like ConfusionMatrixDisplay from sklearn integration, or custom
          annotations with bounding boxes
  verdict: APPROVED
