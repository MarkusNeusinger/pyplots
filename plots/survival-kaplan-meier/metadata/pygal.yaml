review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Kaplan-Meier step function using pygal XY chart
  - Colorblind-safe blue/orange palette with good contrast
  - Includes 95% confidence intervals as filled bands
  - Shows censored observations with tick marks on curves
  - Custom Style well-tuned for large canvas (4800x2700)
  - Clean comparison of two treatment groups showing distinct survival patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is cluttered with 6 entries including CI bands and censored marks that
    do not need separate legend entries
  - Grid lines (dashed guides) are slightly distracting and could use lower alpha
  - Censored tick marks appear as dots rather than traditional vertical tick marks
    due to pygal limitations
