review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts variwide module for true Marimekko visualization
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with clear segment boundaries
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips provides rich user experience
  - Realistic market share data with meaningful regional variations
  - Clean data label formatting with percentage symbols
  weaknesses:
  - Region names (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East)
    are NOT visible on the chart - plotBands labels are positioned at y:2680 which
    is outside the visible area
  - Legend symbols (small colored circles) could be larger for better visibility at
    this resolution
  - Title format includes chart description; spec-id should be more prominent
