review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using tile grid cartogram approach for choropleth
    visualization
  - Clean, readable layout with well-sized state labels and values
  - Good use of seaborn heatmap function with appropriate colormap
  - Realistic economic data scenario with plausible GDP growth rates
  - Good colorblind-friendly palette choice (YlGnBu)
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text instead of strictly following spec-id
    format
  - Missing data handling (gray hatched cells) not visible in rendered image
  - Subtitle text could be slightly larger for better readability
  - Could show wider range of values to demonstrate more color scale variation
  image_description: The plot displays a tile grid choropleth map of US states showing
    GDP growth rates. Each state is represented as a square tile arranged in an approximate
    geographic layout. The color scheme uses YlGnBu (yellow-green-blue sequential
    palette) where lighter yellow/green indicates lower growth rates (~0-1%) and darker
    blue indicates higher growth rates (~4-5%). Each tile contains the state abbreviation
    in bold black text and the GDP growth percentage below it. A vertical colorbar
    on the right shows "GDP Growth Rate (%)" ranging from 0 to 5. The title reads
    "US States Economic Growth · choropleth-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Alaska
    and Hawaii are positioned in the bottom left corner. A subtitle at the bottom
    reads "Stylized grid representation of US states colored by annual GDP growth
    rate".

        comment: Uses sns.heatmap which is seaborn's strength, sns.set_theme for styling.
          However, choropleth maps are not seaborn's primary use case; implementation
          is creative but could leverage more statistical features
  verdict: APPROVED
