review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent wind rose visualization with proper meteorological conventions (North
    at top, clockwise direction)
  - Beautiful color progression using seaborn YlOrRd palette from cool to warm
  - Realistic simulated wind data with dominant SW and secondary NE patterns matching
    real-world scenarios
  - Clean stacked bar implementation with white edges for visual separation
  - Well-positioned and styled legend with proper title
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit radial axis label (should indicate Frequency or similar)
  - Seaborn is used primarily for styling rather than seaborn plotting functions -
    actual bars drawn with matplotlib polar bar plot
  image_description: The plot displays a polar wind rose chart with 16 directional
    sectors. The title "windrose-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed
    at the top in bold black text. North (N) is correctly positioned at the top, with
    compass directions (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) labeled around the perimeter in bold
    black text. The chart shows stacked colored bars representing wind speed categories,
    progressing from pale yellow (0-3 m/s) through orange shades (3-6, 6-10 m/s) to
    red/crimson (10-15, 15+ m/s). The dominant wind direction is clearly from the
    SW, with a prominent ~30% frequency spike showing strong winds (many red/orange
    segments). A secondary NE pattern (~10% frequency) is visible with moderate speeds.
    The radial axis shows percentage labels (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%) with
    subtle gray grid lines. A legend titled "Wind Speed" is positioned in the lower
    right corner with a white background and gray border, showing all five speed categories
    with their colors.

        comment: Uses sns.set_style("whitegrid"), sns.set_context("talk"), sns.color_palette("YlOrRd");
          however, the actual plotting is done with matplotlib's ax.bar on polar projection,
          not seaborn plotting functions
  verdict: APPROVED
