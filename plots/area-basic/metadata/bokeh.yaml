review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic website traffic data with believable weekly patterns and upward trend
  - Proper use of Bokeh varea() for area fill with line overlay for definition
  - Semi-transparent fill (0.4) matches spec recommendation (0.3-0.5)
  - Y-axis correctly starts at 0 for honest area representation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity - Bokeh key strength is interactive exploration
  - Axis labels lack units (could be Daily Visitors count or similar)
  - Large empty space below data since values range 4000-7000 but y starts at 0
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024. The filled area uses a steel blue color (#306998) with 40%
    transparency, creating visual weight that emphasizes the magnitude of visitor
    counts. A solid line traces the top edge of the area for clear definition. The
    x-axis shows dates from Jan 01, 2024 to Feb 01, with clear date labels. The y-axis
    displays "Daily Visitors" ranging from 0 to approximately 7000. The title "area-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top left. The data exhibits a realistic weekly
    cyclical pattern (weekend dips) with an overall upward trend across the month.
    Subtle dashed grid lines aid value estimation. The y-axis correctly starts at
    0, which is essential for area charts to avoid misleading representations.
