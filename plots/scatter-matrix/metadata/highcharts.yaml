review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Clean 4×4 grid layout with proper diagonal histograms and off-diagonal scatter
    plots
  - 'Good use of transparency (opacity: 0.75) for overlapping points'
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic Iris-like data generation with appropriate distributions per species
  - Proper variable labeling with units (cm)
  - Stacked histograms effectively show species composition in each bin
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is extremely small and nearly illegible - needs to be significantly
    larger
  - Import statement for json placed inside loop instead of at top of file with other
    imports
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python library as recommended; instead manually constructs
    HTML/JSON
  - Axis tick labels and variable names could be larger for better readability at
    this resolution
  - Histogram stacking makes it difficult to compare individual species distributions
    - grouped bars or overlaid with transparency might be clearer
