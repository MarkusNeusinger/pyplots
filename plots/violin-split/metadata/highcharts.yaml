review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of split violin concept using areasplinerange series
  - Clean visual separation between Remote (blue) and Office (yellow) groups with
    colorblind-safe palette
  - Median markers (white diamonds) provide useful statistical reference points
  - Realistic and meaningful data scenario (employee satisfaction by work arrangement)
  - Proper KDE computation with Gaussian kernel and Silverman's rule of thumb for
    bandwidth
  - Good use of inverted chart to achieve horizontal violin orientation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines on the satisfaction score axis would improve readability
  - Image height is 2561px instead of the expected 2700px (aspect ratio slightly off)
  - Median markers could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a split violin chart with 4 departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, HR) on the x-axis and Satisfaction Score (1-10) on the y-axis.
    Each violin is split into two halves: blue (Remote workers) on the left and yellow
    (Office workers) on the right. The distributions meet at the center line, showing
    the density of satisfaction scores for each group. White diamond markers indicate
    the median for each distribution. The title follows the correct format "violin-split
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Employee Satisfaction Scores: Remote
    vs Office Workers". A legend in the top-right corner identifies Remote (blue)
    and Office (yellow). The plot shows clear differences between groups - for example,
    Engineering Remote workers have higher satisfaction than Office workers, while
    Sales shows the opposite pattern.'

        comment: Uses areasplinerange for smooth violin shapes, inverted chart for
          horizontal layout, custom KDE computation. Could leverage more Highcharts-specific
          features like animations or better tooltip formatting.
  verdict: APPROVED
