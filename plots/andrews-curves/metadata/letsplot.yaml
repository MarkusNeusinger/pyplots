review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation algorithm
  - Proper normalization of data using StandardScaler before transformation
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.4) for overlapping curves as recommended in
    spec
  - Clear cluster separation visible between species
  - Proper use of π symbols in x-axis tick labels
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, readable code structure
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines to aid visual reference (theme_minimal may have removed
    them, but subtle grid would help)
  - Missing explicit random seed (though data is deterministic from sklearn, good
    practice to include)
  image_description: The plot displays Andrews curves for the Iris dataset, showing
    150 Fourier series curves colored by species. Blue curves represent setosa (tightly
    clustered in lower range), yellow curves represent versicolor (middle range),
    and red/orange curves represent virginica (spreading into higher values). The
    X-axis shows parameter t from -π to π with proper Greek letter labels at key intervals
    (-π, -π/2, 0, π/2, π). The Y-axis displays Fourier Function Value ranging approximately
    from -5 to 5.5. The title correctly follows the format "andrews-curves · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right identifies the three species. Transparency
    (alpha=0.4) effectively reveals density patterns where curves overlap.
