review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature pattern that clearly demonstrates line plot trends
  - Perfect title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800×2700 output with scale=3
  - Good use of theme_minimal() and custom theme elements for professional appearance
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated as expected for interactive library
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent (dashed style helps but alpha could be lower)
  - Does not leverage lets-plot specific interactive features like tooltips or hover
    effects
  - Markers (size=5) are slightly large for 12 data points; size=4 would be more proportionate
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic line chart showing monthly temperature
    readings over 12 months. A blue line (#306998) with circular markers connects
    data points from Month 1 to Month 12. The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging
    from approximately 4 to 30 degrees. The data exhibits a realistic sinusoidal seasonal
    pattern: low temperatures in winter months (~4°C in January, February, December),
    gradually rising through spring, peaking in summer (~29°C in July), and declining
    through fall. The background uses a minimal theme with light gray dashed grid
    lines. The title "line-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.'
