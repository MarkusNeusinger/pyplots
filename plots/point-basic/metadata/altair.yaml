review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of layered Altair chart combining points, rules, and
    tick marks for caps
  - Clean reference line implementation using separate DataFrame
  - Proper use of Altair declarative encoding system with explicit type annotations
    (:Q, :N)
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity
  - Appropriate horizontal orientation for categorical labels as spec recommends
  - High-quality visual output with proper sizing (1600x900 with scale_factor=3.0)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Effect Size lacks units (could be Effect Size Cohens d or similar)
  - Library features underutilized - could add selection/highlighting for interactivity
  - The seed(42) call is unnecessary since no random data generation actually occurs
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate chart with 6 groups
    (Treatment A, B, C, D, Control, Placebo) on the y-axis and "Effect Size" on the
    x-axis (ranging from -3.0 to 5.0). Each group shows a blue filled circle marker
    at its estimate value, with horizontal error bars extending to confidence interval
    bounds. The error bars have vertical caps at both endpoints. A dashed gray vertical
    reference line is positioned at x=0 (null hypothesis). The color scheme uses a
    consistent blue (#306998) for all data elements. The title "point-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. Text is clearly readable, and the layout
    effectively uses the canvas space.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative layering system with mark_point, mark_rule,
          mark_tick, but doesn't use interactive features like selections or dynamic
          tooltips beyond basic
  verdict: APPROVED
