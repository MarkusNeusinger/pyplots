review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical clustering visualization with clear species separation
    (Setosa clearly distinct from Versicolor/Virginica)
  - Perfect use of scipy.cluster.hierarchy with Ward's method for meaningful distance
    metric
  - Color-coded clusters make the hierarchical relationships immediately apparent
  - Clean, professional styling with removed top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Realistic iris dataset context that is widely recognized in data science
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage any distinctive matplotlib visualization features beyond basic
    figure/axes setup
  - Y-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., Ward Linkage Distance or include
    clustering interpretation hints)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a dendrogram (hierarchical clustering tree)
    with 15 iris flower samples on the x-axis and Ward distance on the y-axis (ranging
    0-10). The tree structure shows three distinct color-coded clusters: orange branches
    for Setosa samples (left side), green branches for Versicolor and Virginica samples
    (center and right). The blue horizontal line at the top connects the Setosa cluster
    to the Versicolor/Virginica cluster at distance ~10. Sample labels are rotated
    45 degrees and clearly readable. The title "dendrogram-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The plot has a clean white background with subtle dashed horizontal
    grid lines on the y-axis. Top and right spines are removed for a cleaner appearance.'
