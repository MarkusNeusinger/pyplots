review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of vector field using geom_segment with arrow aesthetics
  - Color-coded magnitude provides additional data dimension as suggested in spec
    notes
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Rotation field pattern is clearly visible and mathematically correct
  - Good arrow scaling that preserves relative magnitudes while maintaining visibility
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or at least "(dimensionless)" notation for a mathematical
    field
