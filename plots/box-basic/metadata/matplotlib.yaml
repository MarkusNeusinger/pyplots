review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with proper font hierarchy (24/20/16pt)
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Uses tick_labels parameter correctly (avoiding deprecated API)
  - Good customization of box elements (patch_artist, custom line widths, alpha transparency)
  - Realistic department performance context with varied distributions
  - Proper outlier display with styled flierprops
  - Subtle grid enhances readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Engineering (#306998) and Sales (#4B8BBE) colors are both blue shades - could
    use more distinct colors for better differentiation
  - Performance scores exceed 100 for some outliers which is slightly inconsistent
    if interpreting as percentage scores
