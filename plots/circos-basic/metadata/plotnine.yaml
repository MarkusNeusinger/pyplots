review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex circos plot using only plotnine native grammar
    of graphics, without falling back to matplotlib
  - Beautiful color palette with 6 distinct, colorblind-accessible colors for regions
  - Proper chord/ribbon geometry with Bezier curves connecting segments through center
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear data structures for segments, arcs, chords,
    and tracks
  - Realistic trade flow scenario with meaningful bidirectional connections between
    world regions
  - Includes inner data track as specified, adding visual depth
  weaknesses:
  - Inner data track shows the same data as outer ring (segment totals) rather than
    different attribute data
  - Some chord ribbons are quite thin and could be more visible
  - Slight layout imbalance with more empty space at bottom of canvas
