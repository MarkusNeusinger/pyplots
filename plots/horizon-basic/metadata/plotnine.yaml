review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart concept using plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Creative use of geom_area with position=identity and facet_wrap for multi-series
    display
  - Blue/orange diverging color scheme is colorblind-accessible and aesthetically
    pleasing
  - Realistic server CPU deviation scenario with daily/weekly patterns and random
    spikes
  - Comprehensive theme customization with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Clean band-folding algorithm that correctly separates positive and negative values
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label says Folded Value (stacked bands) which is slightly misleading since
    position=identity means bands overlay rather than stack
  - Some band colors within the same polarity (e.g., +Low, +Medium, +High) are somewhat
    similar and could benefit from more contrast
