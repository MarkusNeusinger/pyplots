review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of step histogram with filled area for clear visualization of cumulative
    distribution
  - Smart percentile annotation positioning to avoid overlap (right-aligned for 75th/90th,
    left-aligned for 25th/50th)
  - Realistic exam score scenario with multi-modal distribution (combining normal
    distributions)
  - Appropriate color choices with good accessibility (blue primary, yellow reference
    lines)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or be more descriptive (e.g., "Exam Score (points)"
    or "Cumulative Probability")
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features like axhspan for percentile bands
    or secondary y-axis for counts
