review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual offset positioning for annotations prevents all label overlaps
  - Connector lines from labels to points add clarity without visual clutter
  - Realistic tech company data with plausible market cap and revenue figures
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use adjustText or similar library for automatic label placement as suggested
    in spec (though manual approach works well for this dataset)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart with 15 data points representing
    technology companies. Each point is rendered as a moderately large circle (~s=250)
    in Python Blue (#306998) with white edge outlines and 0.7 alpha transparency.
    The X-axis shows "Market Capitalization ($ Billions)" ranging from 0 to 240, while
    the Y-axis displays "Annual Revenue ($ Billions)" from 0 to 70. Each data point
    has a company name label (e.g., "QuantumAI", "ByteWorks", "TechCorp") connected
    by subtle gray connector lines. The title follows the required format: "scatter-annotated
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A dashed gray grid with 0.3 alpha provides reference
    lines. The layout is 16:9 landscape format with good margins.'

        comment: Grid is appropriate (alpha=0.3), but no legend present; however,
          this plot type doesn't require a legend since data is annotated directly

        comment: Uses basic annotate() method; could have used adjustText library
          or more advanced annotation features, but the manual offset approach is
          acceptable for the data size
  verdict: APPROVED
