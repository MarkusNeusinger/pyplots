review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using pygal XY chart for precise point positioning
  - Proper vertical reference line at null effect (x=0) with dashed styling
  - Weight-proportional marker sizing for study importance visualization
  - Study labels include confidence interval values for quick reference
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme with blue studies and yellow pooled estimate
  weaknesses:
  - Pooled estimate shown as circle instead of traditional diamond shape specified
    in the spec
  - Legend at bottom is redundant and cluttered since Y-axis labels already describe
    elements
  - Confidence interval whiskers could be thicker for better visibility at this canvas
    size
