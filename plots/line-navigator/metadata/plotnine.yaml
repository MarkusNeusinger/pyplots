review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine composition operator (/) to create two-panel layout
  - Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected regions using geom_rect
    with alpha
  - Good data generation with realistic seasonal patterns, trend, and anomalies
  - Proper adjustment of subplot heights to emphasize main chart over navigator
  - Consistent color scheme (#306998) between main chart and navigator
  weaknesses:
  - Navigator takes ~40% of space rather than spec recommended 15-20%
  - Axis label Sensor Reading lacks units
  - Code mixes plotnine grammar with matplotlib figure manipulation
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a line chart with mini navigator pattern. The top panel (main chart) shows detailed sensor readings for the selected range from late May to mid-October 2022, with values ranging from approximately 30-65. The line is rendered in a blue color (#306998). The X-axis shows dates in "DD Mon" format at 2-week intervals with 45-degree rotation. The Y-axis is labeled "Sensor Reading" with integer values.

    The bottom panel (navigator) displays the full 3-year dataset (Jan 2021 - Jan 2024) showing clear seasonal patterns with peaks around 75-80 and troughs around 30. A light blue shaded region with dark blue vertical boundary lines indicates the "Selected Range" (Jun-Oct 2022) that corresponds to the detail view above. A "Selected Range" label is positioned within the highlighted area. The navigator has its own "Navigator" title and "Date" X-axis label.

    Both charts share consistent blue styling. The layout successfully demonstrates the navigator concept with the main chart taking approximately 60% of the vertical space and the navigator 40%.
