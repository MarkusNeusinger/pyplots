review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 resolution with clear, readable fonts throughout
  - Clean, professional styling with subtle dashed grid lines and light background
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource which is idiomatic Bokeh
  - Realistic temperature data scenario that matches spec examples
  - Correct title format and proper axis labels with units
  - Markers with white borders provide good visibility and visual appeal
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Bokeh distinctive hover tooltip feature which could enhance
    the static export
  - No legend present (minor issue for single series)
  - Data pattern (warmest mid-month) is slightly artificial for typical monthly weather
    data
