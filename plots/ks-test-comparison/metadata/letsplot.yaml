review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot distinctive features (flavor_high_contrast_light, element_markdown,
    layer_tooltips) that showcase the library unique capabilities
  - Strong data storytelling with shaded ribbon showing total divergence area plus
    annotated K-S line highlighting the key insight
  - Publication-quality typography with explicitly set font sizes and intentional
    visual hierarchy
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue + amber) with explicit protanopia-friendly design
  - Complete spec compliance with all required features implemented
  weaknesses:
  - DE-01 could reach 8/8 with slightly more refined color harmony or additional design
    touches
  - The shaded ribbon covers a large area which slightly reduces the visual contrast
    between the two ECDF lines in some regions
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step functions comparing credit score distributions for "Good
    Customers" (dark blue, #306998) and "Bad Customers" (amber/orange, #D4820C). A
    light purple shaded ribbon fills the area between the two ECDFs across the entire
    overlapping range, visually representing the divergence. A dashed purple vertical
    line at approximately credit score 555 marks the point of maximum divergence,
    with a bold purple label "D = 0.469" connected by an arrow. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold, with a rich-text subtitle showing "K-S Statistic:
    0.469 | p-value: 9.52e-38 (highly significant)" using bold formatting and grey
    color for the significance note. The x-axis is labeled "Credit Score (points)"
    spanning 300-850, and the y-axis is "Cumulative Proportion" from 0 to 1. The legend
    is positioned at the top. The background is clean with only horizontal dashed
    grid lines, no vertical grid, and subtle axis lines. Layout is well-balanced with
    the plot filling the canvas effectively.'
