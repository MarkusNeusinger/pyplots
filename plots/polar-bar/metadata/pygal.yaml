review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Radar chart as the closest approximation to polar bar functionality
  - Clean, professional blue gradient color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic wind rose data showing dominant westerly/northwesterly wind pattern
  - Well-structured legend with clear wind speed category labels including units (km/h)
  - Proper use of inner_radius to create visual separation from center
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate comments
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses hyphen separator instead of middle dot as per spec format
  - Radar chart with filled polygons is visually different from traditional polar
    bar charts with discrete radial bars
  - Some whitespace on the sides of the canvas could be better utilized
