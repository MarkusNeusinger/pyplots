review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and perceptual
    uniformity
  - Multiple distinct density clusters demonstrate the hexbin purpose of revealing
    density patterns
  - Well-sized title, labels, and colorbar with appropriate font scaling
  - Subtle grid styling that does not distract from the data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) rather than using a realistic
    context from the spec applications (e.g., GPS coordinates, sensor readings)
  - Dataset size of 5000 points is on the smaller side for demonstrating hexbin advantage
    over scatter plots (spec mentions 1000-1M+ points)
  - Seaborn is only used for styling, not for actual plotting functionality (though
    seaborn lacks native hexbin support)
