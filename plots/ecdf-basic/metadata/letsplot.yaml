review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with web service response times showing mixed
    distribution characteristics
  - Clean ECDF step function with perfect y-axis range (0 to 1) and sensible tick
    marks at quartiles
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good use of theme_minimal() with appropriately sized text elements
  - Correct manual ECDF calculation showing understanding of the algorithm
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (dashed at 0.5 width) making percentile reading difficult
    - the spec notes grid lines should help with reading specific percentile values
  image_description: The plot displays an ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) showing web service response times. The chart uses a dark blue (#306998)
    step line against a white background with light gray dashed grid lines. The X-axis
    is labeled "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to ~270ms, and the Y-axis shows
    "Cumulative Proportion" from 0 to 1 with breaks at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. The
    title "ecdf-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The step function
    shows a steep initial rise (reflecting the exponential distribution of fast responses)
    that gradually flattens, with a secondary steeper section around 180-220ms (reflecting
    the normal distribution of slower responses).
