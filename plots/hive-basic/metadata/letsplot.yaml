review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept using lets-plot grammar of graphics
  - Bezier curve calculation for edges creates smooth, visually appealing connections
  - Comprehensive legend with three informative sections (Edge Type, Connections,
    Module Type)
  - Realistic software module dependency scenario matches spec applications exactly
  - Good use of color coding for both nodes and edges by module type
  - Clean radial axis layout with appropriate spacing (0.3-0.95 range)
  - Node sizing by degree effectively communicates connectivity importance
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text before the required format
  - Edge curves could be slightly less transparent in the center region where they
    overlap
