- Budget allocation breakdown across departments
- Survey response analysis showing answer percentages
- Portfolio composition showing asset allocation

## Data

- `category` (categorical) - names for each slice
- `value` (numeric) - values representing each category's proportion
- Size: 3-7 categories
- Example: market share or budget allocation data
