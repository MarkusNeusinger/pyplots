review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_tile for
    regions, geom_point for data)
  - Clear visual distinction between correctly classified and misclassified points
    using different shapes (circles vs X markers)
  - Good color scheme that is colorblind-accessible (blue/yellow)
  - Proper handling of the SVM decision boundary with appropriate mesh resolution
  - Well-organized legend with separate sections for predicted regions and training
    points
  - Code follows KISS principles with clear, linear structure
  weaknesses:
  - Training point marker colors could have stronger contrast against the background
    regions (both use similar saturation levels)
  - Legend could be more compact to allow more space for the plot area
  - Grid lines completely removed - subtle grid could help with reading exact coordinate
    values
