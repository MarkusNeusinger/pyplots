  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between categories
  - Realistic file system example matching spec applications
  - Creative use of Highcharts renderer API to implement icicle chart (not a native
    chart type)
  - Well-formatted title following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good label truncation strategy prevents overlap while showing as much text as
    possible
  weaknesses:
  - Some leaf node labels are truncated (e.g., Footer, Modal.tsx) - could show more
    with smaller font
  - Uses helper functions instead of pure KISS linear code structure
  image_description: 'The plot displays an icicle chart visualizing a file system
    hierarchy. At the top is a dark gray "Project Files" root node spanning the full
    width. Below it are four color-coded main directories: blue "src" (largest portion),
    yellow "docs", purple "tests", and cyan "assets". Each directory is subdivided
    into subdirectories (components, utils, api, images, styles) and leaf nodes showing
    individual files with sizes in KB (e.g., "guide.md (120 KB)", "banner.jpg (280
    KB)"). The chart uses top-to-bottom orientation with children stacked below parents.
    A legend at the bottom identifies the four main categories. The title "icicle-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with an explanatory subtitle.'
