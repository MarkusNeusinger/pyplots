review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes and marker visibility
  - Proper implementation of elbow curve with clear elbow point annotation using Highcharts
    annotations module
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  - Correctly uses both LineSeries and ScatterSeries for different purposes
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper right corner could be better integrated with the chart
    area
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific interactive features for the interactive
    HTML output
