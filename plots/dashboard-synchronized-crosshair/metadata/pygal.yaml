review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent HTML implementation with JavaScript-based synchronized crosshairs and
    tooltips
  - Realistic financial data scenario with correlated price/volume/RSI
  - Good color choices that are accessible
  - Clean code structure with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - PNG output shows all three series on a single normalized chart instead of the
    required stacked vertical dashboard layout
  - The code creates 3 separate charts but the PNG composite appears to have been
    replaced with a single combined chart
  - Independent y-axis scales are lost - all data normalized to 0-100 instead of Price
    ($), Volume (M), RSI (0-100)
  - The synchronized crosshair annotation in PNG is not visible in the current output
  - Legend incorrectly labels series as normalized when spec expects actual units
  image_description: 'The PNG image shows a single combined chart with all three data
    series (Price, Volume, RSI) overlaid on the same plot area. The title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Three line series are visible:
    blue for "Price (normalized)", yellow/gold for "Volume (normalized)", and red/coral
    for "RSI". The x-axis shows "Trading Day" with labels from Day 1 to Day 200 (rotated
    45°). The y-axis on both sides shows "Normalized Value" ranging from 0 to 100.
    A legend appears at the bottom. The chart uses a white background with a light
    gray plot area. All three series fluctuate across the 200 trading days, with the
    price series showing a general downward trend from around 80-100 to 10-30. Critically,
    this is NOT the stacked vertical dashboard layout specified - all series are on
    one chart instead of three separate panels with independent y-axes.'
