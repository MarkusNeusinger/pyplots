review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine faceting (facet_wrap with free_y scales) for multi-panel
    layout
  - Proper categorical ordering ensures consistent panel arrangement (Price, Volume,
    RSI)
  - Good visual demonstration of synchronized crosshair concept with vertical line
    spanning all panels
  - Value labels at crosshair position with appropriate formatting per metric type
  - Clean data generation with realistic stock market context
  - Professional styling with minimal theme and subtle grid
  weaknesses:
  - RSI panel strip text shows RSI Indicator instead of just RSI (minor inconsistency)
  - Y-axis label is blank but could show contextual labels per panel
  image_description: 'The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with
    three vertically stacked panels using plotnine''s faceting capabilities. The top
    panel shows "Price ($)" with values ranging from ~85 to ~110, the middle panel
    shows "Volume (M)" ranging from ~1 to ~3.5 million, and the bottom panel shows
    "RSI Indicator" ranging from ~10 to ~80. All three panels share a common x-axis
    showing dates from January 2024 to October 2024. A synchronized red dashed vertical
    crosshair line spans all three panels at approximately late June 2024, with red
    marker points highlighting the values at that position. Each panel has a label
    showing the value at the crosshair position: "$92.89" for price, "1.86M" for volume,
    and "RSI: 10.0" for RSI. The lines are rendered in blue (#306998) with good visibility.
    The grid is subtle gray, and the overall layout demonstrates the synchronized
    crosshair concept effectively for a static library.'
