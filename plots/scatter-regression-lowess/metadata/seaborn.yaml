review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn regplot with lowess=True for the canonical LOWESS implementation
  - Strong color contrast between blue scatter points and yellow LOWESS curve makes
    the regression line very visible
  - Appropriate marker size and transparency for 200 data points
  - Well-structured synthetic data that demonstrates the LOWESS curve adapting to
    non-linear patterns
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual
  - The synthetic data could show more distinct local variations to better demonstrate
    LOWESS local-fitting capabilities
