review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of opacity-based data recency visualization with four
    distinct groups
  - Clean, well-structured code following the KISS principle
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with appropriate value ranges
  - Good use of Highcharts features including hover states, tooltips, and styled legend
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Library version shown as "unknown" in the header comment
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for optimal visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot visualization of streaming
    sensor data showing Temperature (°C) on the x-axis (ranging from ~20 to ~30.5)
    versus Humidity (%) on the y-axis (ranging from ~27 to ~75). The data points use
    a consistent blue color (#306998) with varying opacity levels to indicate data
    recency - older readings appear more transparent while newer readings are more
    opaque. The plot is divided into four series shown in the legend: "Oldest readings",
    "Older readings", "Recent readings", and "Latest readings", each with progressively
    increasing opacity. The title follows the correct format "scatter-streaming ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining that opacity indicates data
    recency. A subtle grid is visible in the background, and the legend is positioned
    in the upper right corner with a semi-transparent white background.'

          could have slightly larger text for the canvas size.
