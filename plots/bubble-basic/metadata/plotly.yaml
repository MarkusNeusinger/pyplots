review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's sizeref/sizemode system for proper area-based bubble
    scaling
  - Dual encoding of market share through both size and color creates strong visual
    hierarchy
  - Carefully crafted outlier data points that tell a business story (market leaders
    vs emerging players)
  - Size legend with three reference bubbles provides clear context for interpreting
    bubble sizes
  - Rich hover tooltips via hovertemplate enhance the interactive HTML version
  - Custom sequential blue colorscale with good contrast from light to dark values
  - White edge outlines on bubbles provide clean separation even when overlapping
  weaknesses:
  - The colorscale could use a perceptually-uniform scheme (like Plotly's built-in
    Blues or Viridis) rather than a hand-crafted one, which may not be perfectly perceptually
    uniform
  - The size legend bubbles in the lower-right appear slightly disconnected from the
    main chart; tighter integration would improve cohesion
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart titled "bubble-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The chart plots 40 companies as bubbles on
    a white background with subtle light gray gridlines. The x-axis shows "Revenue
    ($ millions)" ranging from 10 to ~100, and the y-axis shows "Growth Rate (%)"
    ranging from 0 to 45. Each bubble's size and color (a sequential blue colorscale
    from light steel blue for low values to very dark navy for high values) represent
    "Market Share (%)". A vertical colorbar on the right side displays the market
    share scale from ~5% to ~33%. Below the colorbar, a size legend shows three reference
    bubbles labeled 5%, 15%, and 30%. Three large, dark bubbles cluster in the upper-right
    corner (high revenue ~85-92M, high growth ~38-42%, large market share ~28-33%),
    representing market leaders. Two small, light bubbles appear in the upper-left
    area (~15-18M revenue, ~28-32% growth, ~4-5% market share), representing emerging
    players. The majority of bubbles are concentrated in the middle zone (30-60M revenue,
    10-25% growth), showing a visible positive correlation. All bubbles have thin
    white edge outlines for visual separation and moderate transparency (~0.78) to
    handle overlapping.
