review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard layout demonstrating custom grid with non-uniform cell sizes
    using plotnine composition operators
  - Clear visual hierarchy with main plot given appropriate prominence
  - Real-world investment portfolio scenario is highly relevant to the spec executive
    dashboard application
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with shared theme definitions
  - Good use of stat_smooth for trend line with confidence band in main plot
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Text sizes on right-panel subplots are slightly smaller than optimal for the canvas
    size
  - The grid layout uses | and / operators which create a 2-column layout, but does
    not demonstrate explicit colspan/rowspan parameters mentioned in spec notes
  - Library features score could be higher with additional ggplot2 grammar features
