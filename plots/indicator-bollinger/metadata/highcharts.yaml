review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all Bollinger Band components with correct visual
    hierarchy
  - Proper use of Highcharts arearange for the band fill with appropriate opacity
  - Clear differentiation between line types (solid for price, dotted for SMA, dashed
    for bands)
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Well-structured data generation with realistic price movements and GARCH-like
    volatility clustering
  - Correct 20-period rolling calculation for SMA and standard deviations
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (lower alpha or only on Y-axis)
  - The 20-Day SMA yellow dotted line could be slightly thicker for better visibility
    against the blue band fill
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Bollinger Bands chart for stock price data from January 2024 to June 2024. The title "indicator-bollinger · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is shown at the top with a subtitle "20-Day SMA with 2 Standard Deviation Bands". The chart features:
    - A cyan/turquoise solid line representing the Close Price
    - A yellow/gold dotted line representing the 20-Day SMA (middle band)
    - Blue dashed lines for the Upper Band (+2σ) and Lower Band (-2σ)
    - A light blue semi-transparent fill area between the upper and lower bands
    - Y-axis labeled "Price (USD)" with values ranging from $112 to $180
    - X-axis labeled "Date" with monthly intervals (Feb 2024 through Jun 2024)
    - A legend at the top showing all five series with their respective colors and styles
    - Clean white background with subtle gray grid lines
