review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the pyramid chart concept with proper left-extending
    (negative) and right-extending (positive) bars
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Smart use of absolute value labels on x-axis for cleaner presentation
  - Good symmetric axis scaling with 15% padding for visual balance
  - Appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Color choice of blue and yellow is colorblind-safe but unconventional for gender
    representation - traditional blue/pink or blue/red would be more immediately recognizable
  - Legend placement in upper right corner is slightly isolated from the chart data
