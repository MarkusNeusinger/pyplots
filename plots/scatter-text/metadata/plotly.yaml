review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of text-as-markers concept using Plotly mode=text
  - Rich interactive features with detailed hover information showing language, paradigm,
    abstraction level, and type safety
  - Well-organized code that groups data by category for proper legend display
  - Thoughtful color palette with 8 distinguishable colors for different paradigm
    categories
  - Clean, publication-quality visual presentation with proper font sizes and subtle
    grid
  weaknesses:
  - Some labels in the middle-right area (Python, Perl, R region) are slightly clustered
  - Code imports numpy primarily for array creation and seed, which could be simplified
    with plain Python lists
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot where programming language
    names serve as data points positioned on a 2D coordinate system. The x-axis represents
    "Level of Abstraction (0-10 scale)" and the y-axis represents "Type Safety (0-10
    scale)". 30 programming languages are displayed as text labels, color-coded by
    paradigm category: Multi-paradigm (blue), OOP (amber/yellow), Systems (red), Functional
    (green), Statistical (purple), Scientific (cyan), Scripting (orange), and Legacy
    (gray). The title follows the correct format "scatter-text · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    centered at the top. A legend on the right side shows the paradigm categories
    with small "Aa" text indicators. The layout is clean with a white background,
    subtle gridlines, and well-distributed language labels across the plot area. Languages
    like Haskell and OCaml appear at the top right (high abstraction, high type safety),
    while Assembly appears at the bottom left (low abstraction, low type safety).'
