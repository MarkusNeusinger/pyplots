review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib Sankey module with two connected diagrams showing
    realistic energy flow scenario
  - Clear color distinction between input sources (blue) and output distribution (yellow)
    aids comprehension
  - All labels include both descriptive names and quantitative values with units (TWh)
  - Energy balance is mathematically verified in code (300 TWh in = 200 TWh out +
    100 TWh losses)
  - Clean layout with axes turned off and informative subtitle explaining the flow
    pattern
  - Appropriate font sizes (18pt labels, 26pt title) ensure readability at full resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit legend to explain that blue represents primary energy sources
    and yellow represents end-use distribution
  - The assert statement adds slight complexity that could be replaced with a comment
