review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the radar chart geometry using manual polygon construction
    with patch()
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of transparency (alpha=0.25) allowing overlapping areas to be visible
  - Good color choices with distinct colors for each series
  - Correct title format and professional appearance
  - Both PNG and HTML output provided, leveraging Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned outside the main plot area with some visual separation
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (blue-yellow combination)
  - Grid value labels are slightly small relative to axis labels
