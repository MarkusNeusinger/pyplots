review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper fill effect emphasizing magnitude
  - Good custom style configuration with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Realistic website traffic data with seasonal patterns
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Semi-transparent fill (opacity=0.4) makes the visualization effective
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement is awkward - appears in top-left corner outside the main plot
    area
  - Dots are functional but could be slightly larger for better visibility at full
    resolution
  - Could leverage pygal interpolation feature for smoother curves
