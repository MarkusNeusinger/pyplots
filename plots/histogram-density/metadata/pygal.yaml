review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal distribution data that clearly demonstrates density histogram
    concept
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Well-formatted title following the required convention
  - Good use of pygal Style class for comprehensive customization
  - Appropriate axis labels with descriptive units
  - Smart x-label spacing (every 5th label) prevents overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests adding a reference line or theoretical PDF overlay for context,
    which is not implemented
  - Could use pygal native Histogram chart type instead of Bar chart for more semantic
    correctness
