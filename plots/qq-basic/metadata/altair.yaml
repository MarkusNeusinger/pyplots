review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of inverse normal CDF without scipy dependency (self-contained)
  - Clear visual demonstration of right skewness with data deviating above reference
    line
  - Proper scaling of theoretical quantiles to match sample mean and standard deviation
  - Good use of Altair layering to combine reference line and scatter points
  - Interactive tooltips enhance exploration of individual data points
  - Appropriate styling with Python blue color scheme and dashed yellow reference
    line
  weaknesses:
  - Point size (200) slightly large for 100 points; 150-180 would reduce overlap in
    dense regions
  - Axis labels could include context hint (e.g., Sample Quantiles (sorted values))
  - The manual inverse CDF implementation, while impressive, adds code complexity
