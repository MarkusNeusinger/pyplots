review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with good CPU monitoring scenario and realistic data patterns
  - Effective use of pygal fill area and warning threshold line
  - Title follows the required format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  - Live indicator with current value prominently displayed in legend
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows truncated text (Warning Thresh... instead of full label)
  - Fade effect for older data mentioned in code but not clearly visible in output
    - the trailing edge visual indication could be more prominent
  - X-axis time labels could be slightly larger for better legibility at this canvas
    size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a CPU Usage Monitor with a filled blue area
    chart showing CPU usage percentage (0-100%) over time from 14:29:01 to 14:30:00.
    The chart has a light gray plot background with horizontal gridlines. A dashed
    yellow/gold horizontal line at 80% indicates the warning threshold. The main CPU
    usage data shows realistic fluctuations between roughly 20-77%, with several spikes.
    The rightmost portion (last 5 points) is highlighted in red/coral with larger
    dots, representing the "LIVE" current data. The legend in the top-left shows three
    series: "CPU Usage" (blue), "Warning Thresh..." (truncated yellow), and "Current:
    52.8%" (red). The title "CPU Usage Monitor (Live) · line-realtime · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. X-axis labels are rotated 45° showing timestamps.'
