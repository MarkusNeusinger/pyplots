review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alluvial flow visualization with smooth curved bands connecting nodes
    across three election cycles
  - Party labels clearly positioned on left side with final values and counts on right
    side
  - Well-chosen color scheme distinguishing four categories (blue Democrats, red Republicans,
    yellow Independents, gray Non-Voters)
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.55) for overlapping flows improving readability
  - Realistic voter migration data with plausible transition patterns between elections
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses different format (Voter Migration · alluvial-basic) instead of spec-standard
    format (alluvial-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai)
  - Flow bands colored by source party only - coloring by destination or gradient
    could show transitions more clearly
