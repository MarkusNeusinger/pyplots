review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-time monitoring visualization with clear current value indicator
    in title
  - Creative use of plotBands to highlight High Usage Zone (80-100%)
  - Professional gradient fill on area chart enhances visual appeal
  - Proper sliding window concept with visual indicator (arrow in subtitle)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Highcharts strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Plot area could utilize more of the 4800x2700 canvas (generous margins reduce
    data area)
  - The High Usage Zone label text is quite small (32px) relative to other elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a CPU usage monitoring area chart with a sliding
    window of 60 seconds. The chart has a white background with a light yellow "High
    Usage Zone" band highlighted from 80-100% on the y-axis. The main data is rendered
    as a blue area chart (color #306998) with a gradient fill transitioning from semi-transparent
    blue at the top to nearly transparent at the bottom. Circular markers are visible
    at each data point. The title shows "CPU Usage Monitor (Current: 52.8%) · line-realtime
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the sliding window concept
    with a left-pointing arrow indicating older data scrolls off. The x-axis shows
    time labels from 0s to 55s in 5-second increments labeled "Time (sliding window)".
    The y-axis shows CPU Usage (%) from 0-100 with detailed tick marks. The data shows
    realistic CPU usage fluctuations with spikes around 15s-20s reaching approximately
    80%, and another spike around 50s reaching about 60%. There''s a visible legend
    showing "CPU Usage".'
