    at 4800x2700
  - Clean, professional appearance with plotly_white template
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (salary distributions by department) that demonstrates
    box plot features
  - Good feature coverage showing outliers, varying medians, and different distribution
    spreads
  - Proper dollar formatting on Y-axis with tickformat
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactivity
  weaknesses:
