review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair transform_calculate for implementing jitter with Box-Muller
    transform
  - Clean declarative syntax with proper encoding types (N for nominal, Q for quantitative)
  - Good font sizing configuration making all text highly readable
  - Realistic business context with product ratings across departments
  - Proper use of xOffset encoding for jitter positioning
  - Interactive tooltips with formatted rating values
  weaknesses:
  - No legend present (minor, as single color does not require one, but could show
    data count per category)
  - All categories have exactly 30 points - varying counts would demonstrate the plot
    type better
  - Could use additional Altair features like selection for interactivity or layering
    with mean markers
