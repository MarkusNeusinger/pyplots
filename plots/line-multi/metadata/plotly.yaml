review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with thick lines (width=4), large markers (size=12),
    and distinct marker symbols (circle, square, diamond, triangle)
  - Perfect colorblind-safe palette using Python Blue (#306998), Yellow (#FFD43B),
    Green (#2CA02C), and Purple (#9467BD)
  - Varied line styles (solid, solid, dash, dot) provide additional visual differentiation
    beyond color
  - Realistic business scenario with 4 product lines showing diverse trend patterns
    (growth, seasonal, stable, decline)
  - Clean legend placement with semi-transparent background that does not obscure
    data
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive strengths like custom hover templates or
    range sliders that would enhance the multi-line comparison experience
  - 'Minor inconsistency: y-axis label says Thousands of Units but actual values are
    in the 50-230 range'
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a multi-line comparison chart showing monthly product sales for 4 product categories over 12 months (January to December). The lines are:
    - **Electronics** (blue solid line, circle markers): Shows a strong upward trend from ~155 to ~230 units
    - **Clothing** (yellow solid line, square markers): Shows seasonal variation, starting at ~200, with fluctuations
    - **Home & Garden** (green dashed line, diamond markers): Relatively stable around 100-120 units with slight increase
    - **Sports** (purple dotted line, triangle markers): Declining trend from ~125 to ~70 units

    The title reads "Monthly Product Sales · line-multi · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The y-axis is labeled "Sales (Thousands of Units)" and x-axis "Month". The legend is positioned in the upper left corner with a semi-transparent white background. Grid lines are subtle gray. All text is clearly readable.
