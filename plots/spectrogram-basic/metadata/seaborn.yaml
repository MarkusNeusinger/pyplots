review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of chirp signal showing clear time-frequency relationship
    with bright diagonal trace
  - Proper use of perceptually uniform viridis colormap as recommended in specification
  - Well-formatted colorbar with dB units and appropriate sizing
  - All text elements properly sized for the 16:9 aspect ratio output
  - Correct use of seaborn heatmap for spectrogram visualization with proper axis
    orientation
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines present (minor issue for heatmap plots)
