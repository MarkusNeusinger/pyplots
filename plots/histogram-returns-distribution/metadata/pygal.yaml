review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements histogram with tail region highlighting using different
    colors
  - Displays key statistics (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) in the title
  - Good use of pygal XY chart to create histogram-like visualization with filled
    areas
  - Appropriate data generation with 252 daily observations and realistic return parameters
  - Clean separation of normal vs tail region bars
  weaknesses:
  - Missing normal distribution curve overlay - the spec explicitly requires this
    for comparison but the curve is not visible in the output
  - X-axis tick labels are cluttered and partially overlapping
  - Y-axis label says Frequency (Density × 100) instead of Probability Density
  - Legend is too small and positioned poorly at the bottom
  - Title format should lead with spec-id, not stats
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns distribution
    with approximately 30 bins. Blue bars represent returns within 2 standard deviations
    of the mean, while red/coral bars at the tails show observations beyond ±2σ. The
    title at the top shows key statistics: Mean: 0.044%, Std: 1.451%, Skew: 0.30,
    Kurt: 0.62, followed by "histogram-returns-distribution · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    The Y-axis is labeled "Frequency (Density × 100)" and the X-axis shows "Returns
    (%)". A small legend appears at the bottom left with "Returns" and "Tails (>2σ)"
    labels. The distribution appears roughly bell-shaped with visible tails on both
    ends. Critically, there is NO normal distribution curve overlay visible - only
    the histogram bars are shown.'
