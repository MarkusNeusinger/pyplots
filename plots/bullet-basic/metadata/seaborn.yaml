review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design following spec recommendations (grayscale bands, contrasting
    target markers)
  - Clean implementation showing multiple bullet charts for comparison
  - Proper use of zorder to layer elements correctly (ranges → bars → markers)
  - Well-placed value labels with bold formatting for readability
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all visual elements
  - Good variety in data showing metrics both above and below targets
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is minimally utilized - only sns.barplot for the actual value bars, while
    most visualization work is done with matplotlib. Could better leverage seaborn
    DataFrame-centric approach or styling capabilities.
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bullet chart with four KPI metrics
    (Revenue, Customer Satisfaction, Efficiency, Quality Score) stacked vertically.
    Each metric shows:

    - **Grayscale background bands** in three shades (light gray for Poor, medium
    gray for Satisfactory, dark gray for Good)

    - **Blue horizontal bars** (#306998 Python Blue) representing actual values

    - **Black vertical marker lines** indicating targets

    - **Blue percentage labels** (78%, 85%, 62%, 91%) positioned to the right of each
    bar


    The title "bullet-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold.
    X-axis shows "Performance (%)" from 0-100. A well-positioned legend in the upper
    right explains all elements. The layout is clean with subtle vertical grid lines
    and no overlapping elements.'

        comment: sns.barplot is used but the implementation is primarily matplotlib-based.
          The grayscale bands, target markers, and styling all use matplotlib directly.
          Seaborn's distinctive features (statistical aggregation, automatic styling,
          hue-based coloring) are not leveraged.
  verdict: APPROVED
