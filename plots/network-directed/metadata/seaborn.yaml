review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized nodes and clearly visible directed arrows
  - Smart use of curved edges (arc3,rad=0.1) to prevent arrow overlap on bidirectional-style
    edges
  - Edge weight visualization through both line thickness and alpha transparency creates
    good visual hierarchy
  - Proper title format and professional layout with light background
  - Realistic software module dependency scenario with meaningful groupings
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows module types but edge weight legend (Weak/Strong) mentioned in code
    may not be rendering in final image
  - Node label font size at 14pt is acceptable but 16pt would improve readability
    at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a directed network graph representing software
    module dependencies. It features 11 circular nodes arranged in a semi-hierarchical
    layout with "app" at the top. Nodes are color-coded by module type: blue (Core:
    app, config), yellow (Data: db, cache, model), green (Services: api, auth, router,
    mware), and coral/red (Utils: log, valid). Directed arrows connect nodes showing
    dependencies, with curved edges and arrow heads indicating direction. The arrows
    vary in thickness based on dependency weight. The title "network-directed · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. A legend in the upper left shows the
    four module type categories. The background is a light gray (#fafafa) with white
    node borders providing good contrast.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot for nodes with hue grouping, sns.set_theme for
          styling, and seaborn color palette. However, network graphs are not a seaborn
          specialty, so implementation relies heavily on matplotlib patches.
  verdict: APPROVED
