quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent swarm algorithm implementation that spreads points horizontally to avoid
    overlap
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Realistic, domain-appropriate data showing different distribution shapes (bimodal,
    normal, tight cluster)
  - Mean markers clearly distinguish summary statistics from individual data points
  - Proper title format and clear axis labels
  - Good canvas utilization and layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears truncated or not visible in the rendered output - should verify
    legend displays properly
  - Helper function for swarm positions deviates from KISS principle (though functionally
    necessary)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Performance Score 0-100 would be more informative)
