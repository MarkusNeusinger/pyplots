quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast logic (white text on dark cells, black on light)
  - Clean diverging colormap implementation with proper [-1, 1] range
  - Well-structured realistic financial correlation data with meaningful relationships
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and LinearColorMapper
  - Good sizing choices for the square matrix format
  weaknesses:
  - Generic axis labels "Variable" instead of more descriptive labels
  - Colorbar could include more context (e.g., "Pearson Correlation" instead of just
    "Correlation")
