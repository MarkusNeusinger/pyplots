review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using HorizontalStackedBar with custom SVG injection
    to create bullet chart (pygal lacks native bullet chart type)
  - Grayscale qualitative ranges keep focus on the primary measure bar as recommended
    in spec
  - Comprehensive legend clearly identifying all chart elements
  - Realistic sales KPI scenario with appropriate units and values
  - Good colorblind accessibility with grayscale bands and contrasting blue actual
    bars
  weaknesses:
  - Code complexity due to SVG coordinate calculations and manual element injection
    could be cleaner
  - Target markers could use slightly different styling (the spec mentions thin contrasting
    line perpendicular to the bar - current implementation is adequate but thick)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bullet chart with 5 KPI metrics
    (Satisfaction, Customers, New Orders, Profit, Revenue) arranged vertically. Each
    metric shows three grayscale background bands representing qualitative ranges:
    light gray for Poor (0-50%), medium gray for Satisfactory (50-75%), and darker
    gray for Good (75-100%). Blue horizontal bars (Python blue #306998) represent
    actual values, and thin black vertical markers indicate targets. The title "bullet-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Y-axis labels include the metric name
    and actual value with units (e.g., "Revenue (275$K)"). X-axis shows "Performance
    (% of Maximum)" with scale 0-100. A legend at the bottom identifies Poor, Satisfactory,
    Good ranges plus Actual and Target markers.'
