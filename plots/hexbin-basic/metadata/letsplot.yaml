review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density visualization
  - Clean implementation of three distinct density clusters that clearly demonstrate
    hexbin capabilities
  - Proper title format and well-sized text elements throughout
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics API (ggplot, geom_hex, scale_fill_viridis)
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines that does not distract from the data
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic X Coordinate / Y Coordinate without application context
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features more explicitly in the HTML output
    (tooltips, hover info)
  - Some sparse hexagons at the edges are very small, making density harder to read
    in low-count areas
