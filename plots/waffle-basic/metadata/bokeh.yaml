review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the waffle chart concept with proper 10×10 grid layout
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with clear comments
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and Legend API
  - Good color choices with Python blue as primary color
  - Title follows the correct format specification
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output as expected for Bokeh
  - Appropriate square sizing (0.88) creates nice visual gaps between cells
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned far from the chart creating visual disconnect; could be placed
    closer or inside the plot area
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show category info
    on hover
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) and orange (#E34F26) could be more distinct for better colorblind
    accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10×10 waffle chart (100 squares) representing
    programming language preferences. The grid is filled from bottom-to-top, left-to-right
    with: Python in blue (#306998) occupying 42 squares at the bottom, JavaScript
    in yellow (#FFD43B) with 28 squares in the middle, Java in orange (#E34F26) with
    18 squares above that, and Other in purple (#7B68EE) with 12 squares at the top.
    The title "Programming Language Preferences · waffle-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears centered at the top. A legend on the right side lists all categories with
    their percentages. The background is a subtle light gray (#fafafa), and squares
    have white borders creating visual separation.'
