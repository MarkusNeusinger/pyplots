review:
  strengths:
  - Creative polygon approach to create band effect in pygal (which lacks native fill_between)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Realistic confidence interval scenario with widening uncertainty
  - Good use of custom Style for sizing at 4800x2700
  weaknesses:
  - The confidence band opacity (0.35) is too low making the band nearly invisible
    - needs higher opacity (0.5-0.7) for clear visibility
  - The central trend line could be thicker/more prominent to stand out from the band
  - The stroke on the band polygon creates visible outline but the fill is too faint
    to clearly show the band region
