review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual construction of polar coordinate system in Bokeh (which lacks
    native polar support)
  - Realistic wind data with prevailing directions showing real-world patterns
  - Clean color scheme with good category differentiation
  - Well-proportioned layout using square format appropriate for polar plots
  - Comprehensive angular labeling with cardinal and intermediate directions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned somewhat far from the plot area
  - Radius labels (5, 10, 15...) are small relative to other text elements
  - Does not fully leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities (hover tooltips showing
    exact angle/speed)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a polar scatter chart showing wind measurement data. The visualization features:
    - A circular polar coordinate system with concentric gridlines at intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 m/s
    - Angular spokes at 30° intervals extending from the center
    - Cardinal direction labels (N, S, E, W) in bold black text
    - Intermediate directions (NE, NW, SE, SW) in gray text
    - Three categories of data points: Morning (blue), Afternoon (yellow), and Evening (red)
    - Blue morning points clustered in the NE quadrant showing prevailing wind direction
    - Yellow afternoon points concentrated in the SW quadrant
    - Red evening points scattered more uniformly around the center
    - A legend on the right side showing Morning, Afternoon, and Evening categories
    - Title "polar-scatter · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top
    - "Wind Speed (m/s)" label below the S direction
    - Light gray background (#FAFAFA) with subtle grid lines
