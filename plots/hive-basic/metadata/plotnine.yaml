review:
  strengths:
  - 'Successfully addresses previous feedback: removed function definitions, balanced
    node distribution (7 per axis), improved edge transparency'
  - Creative and valid use of plotnine grammar of graphics primitives to build a hive
    plot
  - Excellent realistic data example with software module dependency network
  - Clean implementation of quadratic Bezier curves for edge bundling
  - Good colorblind-accessible color scheme (blue/yellow/teal)
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (module names) are not displayed on or near the nodes, reducing interpretability
  - Degree values in data are not visually encoded (nodes all same size regardless
    of degree)
  - Edge colors are uniform gray; could use source/target category colors to show
    connection patterns
