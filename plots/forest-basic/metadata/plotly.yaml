review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent forest plot structure with studies displayed as squares with horizontal
    CI whiskers
  - Diamond shape for pooled estimate is clearly visible and properly positioned at
    bottom
  - Good use of Plotly features including hover tooltips with study details
  - Clear visual annotations for Favors Treatment/Favors Control directions
  - Marker sizes correctly scaled proportional to study weights
  - 'Title follows correct format: forest-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - Studies are not ordered by effect size or chronologically as suggested in spec
    - they appear in arbitrary order
  - The No Effect annotation placement could be slightly more prominent
  image_description: The plot displays a meta-analysis forest plot with 12 studies
    arranged vertically on the left side (Smith et al. 2018 through Robinson et al.
    2024), with "Pooled" at the bottom. Each study is represented by a blue square
    marker (varying sizes based on study weight) with horizontal blue lines extending
    left and right showing confidence intervals. The pooled estimate at the bottom
    is shown as a yellow/gold diamond shape. A vertical dashed gray line at x=0 represents
    the "No Effect" reference line, labeled at the top. The x-axis shows "Mean Difference
    in Blood Pressure (mmHg)" ranging from -20 to 5. Annotations at the bottom indicate
    "← Favors Treatment" on the left and "Favors Control →" on the right. The title
    "forest-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The background is
    white with subtle grid lines.
