review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized candles and wicks for the data density
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with appropriate volatility modeling
  - Clean separation of bullish/bearish data sources for proper rendering
  - Proper use of Bokeh segment glyph for wicks and vbar for candle bodies
  - Correct 4800x2700 resolution with appropriately scaled text sizes
  - Subtle grid styling that aids readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red color scheme is not optimal for colorblind accessibility - consider
    blue/orange alternative
  - HTML output does not include hover tooltips to show OHLC values - missed opportunity
    for Bokeh interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 trading days
    of stock price data from January 2024 to February 2024. Green candles indicate
    bullish days (close >= open) and red candles indicate bearish days (close < open).
    The chart shows a clear downward trend from approximately $165 to $135 over the
    period. Each candlestick has visible wicks (shadows) extending above and below
    the body, representing the high-low range. The title "candlestick-basic · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The X-axis displays dates with labels
    like "Jan 01 2024", "Jan 08", "Jan 15", etc. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from about 130 to 170. A subtle dashed grid helps read price levels. The candles
    are well-proportioned with appropriate spacing.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and segment/vbar glyphs appropriately, but
          doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive features (hover tooltips showing OHLC
          values would be a great addition for the HTML version)
  verdict: APPROVED
