review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct volcano plot structure with appropriate data generation showing all three
    gene categories
  - Proper use of custom Style for font sizing and colors at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Good use of subscript notation in axis labels (Log₂, Log₁₀)
  - Threshold lines implemented as dashed strokes
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range extends to -5 but all p-value data is positive; should set y-axis
    minimum to 0 or slightly below
  - Threshold lines appear in the legend, cluttering it with 6 entries instead of
    3 data categories
  - Legend text in top-left is relatively small compared to canvas size
  - Threshold lines use colors from the series palette instead of a neutral gray/black
    dashed style
