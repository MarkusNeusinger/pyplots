review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent automatic text contrast algorithm (white on dark, black on light backgrounds)
  - Realistic financial correlation matrix with meaningful relationships (Revenue-Profit
    positive, Profit-Expenses negative)
  - Perfect 2-decimal formatting for correlation coefficients
  - Clean square layout appropriate for symmetric matrices
  - Proper diverging colormap (RdBu_r) centered at zero
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic ("Variables" instead of "Financial Metrics")
  - Grid linewidth=2 is slightly heavy; alpha or linewidth=1 would be more subtle
  - Does not leverage advanced matplotlib features like matshow() or custom Normalize
