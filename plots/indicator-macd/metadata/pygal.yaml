review:
  strengths:
  - All three MACD components (MACD line, Signal line, histogram) are clearly visible
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - 'Good color choices: green/red histogram contrasts well with blue MACD and orange
    Signal lines'
  - Zero reference line with dashed styling helps identify crossover signals
  - Legend includes parameter values (12,26) and (9) for educational clarity
  - Realistic 100-period window of MACD data showing multiple trend cycles
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram is rendered as filled area chart rather than discrete bars as specified
    in the spec
  - Line thickness for MACD and Signal lines could be increased for better visibility
    at 4800x2700 canvas
  - X-axis date labels are functional but slightly crowded despite rotation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a MACD technical indicator chart with all
    three required components. The chart has a white background with the title "indicator-macd
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The MACD line (blue, thin line) and Signal line
    (orange, thin line) are displayed as continuous lines that oscillate above and
    below the zero reference line. The histogram is shown as filled areas: green (positive
    values above zero) and red (negative values below zero). A dashed black zero reference
    line runs horizontally across the chart. The x-axis shows dates from Feb 20 to
    May 20 with rotated labels every 15 days, and the y-axis shows "MACD Value" ranging
    from approximately -3.5 to 1.5. The legend is positioned at the bottom showing:
    MACD (12,26), Signal (9), Histogram (+), Histogram (-), and Zero. The chart effectively
    shows crossover patterns between MACD and Signal lines, with corresponding histogram
    changes.'
