review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex chart type not natively supported by pygal,
    demonstrating library extensibility
  - Colorblind-safe blue-orange diverging color scheme with clear 3-band gradients
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with 6 different metrics over 24 hours
  - Clean legend design showing positive/negative color gradients
  - Good use of canvas space with readable series labels and time axis
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly "horizon-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" without the
    "Server Metrics (24h)" prefix
  - Missing subtle grid lines or row separators to improve readability across time
  - Class-based structure violates KISS principle, though understandable for custom
    chart type
