review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with bimodal Treatment B demonstrating raincloud key advantage
    over box plots
  - Perfect specification compliance with all three raincloud elements (cloud, rain,
    box) properly positioned
  - Clean visual layout with appropriate font sizes, subtle grid, and good color choices
  - Realistic reaction time data with appropriate scale and context
  - Good use of half-violin technique (clipping to show only right side)
  weaknesses:
  - Implementation uses matplotlib violinplot and boxplot instead of seaborn functions
    - should use sns.violinplot or ptitprince/raincloud seaborn extensions
  - No color legend is present (minor, since x-axis labels convey the same information)
  - Yellow color (#FFD43B) for Treatment A is quite light and may have reduced contrast
    on some displays
