review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate line widths and font sizes for the 3600x3600
    canvas
  - Correct implementation of ROC curve mathematics using parametric approach
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Good color choices that distinguish the three classifiers
  - Produces both PNG and HTML output showcasing Bokeh's dual output capability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in extreme bottom-right corner; could be better placed inside
    the plot area or with more padding
  - Does not utilize Bokeh's interactive features like HoverTool to show threshold
    values on hover
  image_description: 'The plot displays an ROC curve visualization on a square canvas
    with a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. Three ROC curves are shown: a blue curve
    (Random Forest, AUC=0.87) that bows strongly toward the top-left indicating good
    performance, a yellow/gold curve (Logistic Regression, AUC=0.74) with moderate
    curvature, and a red curve (Decision Tree, AUC=0.62) closer to the diagonal. A
    gray dashed diagonal line represents the random classifier baseline. The title
    "roc-curve · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. Both axes are labeled
    descriptively ("False Positive Rate" and "True Positive Rate") and range from
    0 to 1. The legend is positioned in the bottom-right corner showing all four items
    with their AUC scores. Grid lines are subtle with dashed styling.'

        comment: Square format is appropriate for ROC curves; however legend placement
          in extreme bottom-right corner creates some visual imbalance

        comment: Labels are descriptive ("False Positive Rate", "True Positive Rate")
          but lack units (though rates are unitless, could add "(0-1)")

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.3, dashed) which is good; legend text is
          readable but could be better positioned

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, Legend model, and export_png/save for HTML;
          however doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive features like HoverTool which
          would enhance ROC curve exploration
  verdict: APPROVED
