review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Manhattan plot with clear alternating chromosome colors (blue/gray)
    for visual distinction
  - Both genome-wide (red dashed) and suggestive (orange dashed) threshold lines correctly
    positioned at -log10(5e-8) and -log10(1e-5)
  - Smart use of conditional sizing - significant hits above threshold are larger
    (100px) vs non-significant (30px)
  - Chromosome labels clearly positioned below the plot with proper centering
  - 'Good use of Altair features: layered charts, declarative encoding, tooltips for
    interactivity'
  - 'Title follows exact format specification: manhattan-gwas · altair · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label uses subscript notation (-log₁₀) which displays well, but some tick
    labels on the right side of smaller chromosomes (19-22) appear slightly cramped
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Manhattan plot for GWAS data with all 22
    chromosomes arranged along the x-axis. Points are colored in alternating blue
    (#306998) and gray (#7F7F7F) for adjacent chromosomes, creating clear visual separation.
    The y-axis shows -log₁₀(p-value) ranging from 0 to ~11. Two horizontal dashed
    threshold lines are visible: a red line at approximately 7.3 (genome-wide significance,
    p < 5×10⁻⁸) and an orange line at 5.0 (suggestive threshold, p < 1×10⁻⁵). Significant
    peaks are visible above the genome-wide threshold on chromosomes 2, 6, 8, and
    15, with these points displayed larger than non-significant ones. Suggestive signals
    appear on chromosomes 3, 11, and 19. Chromosome labels (1-22) are centered below
    their respective regions. The title "manhattan-gwas · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top.'

        comment: Good use of layered charts, conditional encoding for point size,
          tooltips for interactivity, vconcat for layout - solid Altair usage but
          could leverage more declarative features
  verdict: APPROVED
