review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper colorbar, cell annotations, and diagonal highlighting
  - Creative solution to implement confusion matrix in pygal which lacks native heatmap
    support
  - Proper contrast handling for text on varying background colors
  - Good use of sequential blue colormap matching the specification requirements
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with meaningful class confusion patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Uses custom class extending pygal.graph.graph.Graph which deviates from KISS principle
    (though necessary for pygal)
  - Imports from internal module (pygal.graph.graph) rather than public API
  - The sys.path manipulation for import is a workaround that adds complexity
