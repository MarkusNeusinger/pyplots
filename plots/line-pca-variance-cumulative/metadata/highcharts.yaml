review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with callout annotations that directly communicate
    PCA insights at threshold crossings
  - Well-executed combo chart combining column bars (individual variance), line (cumulative),
    and scatter (threshold markers) in a single cohesive visualization
  - 'Strong visual refinement: dotted grids, subtle column transparency, line shadows,
    custom typography with explicit font weights'
  - Realistic data generation using latent factor model with noise, producing plausible
    industrial sensor PCA results
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: plotLines, annotations module, shared
    tooltips'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Bottom spacing (spacingBottom: 200) is slightly excessive, creating unnecessary
    whitespace below the x-axis'
  - LineSeries is imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area rather than highcharts_core.options.series.line
    — works but is unconventional
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA cumulative explained variance chart
    on a light gray (#fafafa) background. A blue (#306998) line with circle markers
    traces the cumulative variance from ~48% at component 1, rising steeply through
    components 2-4, then plateauing near 100% by component 12. Light blue semi-transparent
    column bars show individual variance ratios beneath the line — the first component''s
    bar reaches ~48%, the second ~31%, then rapidly diminishing. Two horizontal dashed
    threshold lines cross the plot: an orange line at 90% and a purple line at 95%.
    Orange and purple diamond markers highlight where the cumulative line crosses
    these thresholds (at components 3 and 4 respectively). Callout annotations with
    styled borders read "Only 3 components explain 90.0% of variance" (orange-bordered)
    and "4 components reach 95.3% — diminishing returns beyond" (purple-bordered).
    The title reads "PCA Component Selection · line-pca-variance-cumulative · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Industrial Sensor Data (12 features) — explained
    variance by principal components". X-axis labeled "Number of Components" (1-12),
    Y-axis labeled "Explained Variance (%)" (0-100%). A vertical legend in the lower-right
    lists all four series.'
