quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen color contrast (blue boxes, yellow points)
  - Proper use of outlier_alpha=0 to hide box plot outliers since strip shows all
    points
  - Good jitter width (0.15) that keeps points within their category while reducing
    overlap
  - Realistic business scenario with thoughtfully varied distributions per department
  - Clean ggplot2-style code that is easy to read and modify
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Performance Score lacks units (could be Performance Score (%) or similar)
  - Output path uses __file__ which may cause issues in some execution contexts
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features for HTML output (tooltips showing
    exact values)
