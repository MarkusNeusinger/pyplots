review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of Plotly shapes API to draw custom Chernoff faces with paths
  - Feature mapping legend clearly explains which Iris measurement maps to which facial
    feature
  - Good color scheme with species-specific colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Clean grid layout with proper row/column labels
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Uses real Iris dataset which is scientifically meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function create_face_shape() instead of following KISS flat
    structure
  - Title includes "Iris Dataset" prefix; should be just "chernoff-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai"
  - Mouth curvature variation between faces is too subtle to easily distinguish
  - Layout has excessive whitespace at bottom; faces could utilize more vertical space
  - Within-species variation (especially Setosa) is minimal, making faces look nearly
    identical
