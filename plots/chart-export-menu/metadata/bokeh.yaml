review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's built-in toolbar for export functionality (SaveTool)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML with export menu
  - Good use of HoverTool for interactivity showing formatted sales values
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate styling for 4800x2700 canvas with scaled font sizes
  - ColumnDataSource pattern used correctly for data binding
  weaknesses:
  - The spec mentions CSV export capability but the implementation only provides PNG/SVG
    via toolbar (Bokeh limitation)
  - Grid styling is good but no legend present (though not strictly needed for single
    series)
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing monthly sales
    data over 12 months (January through December). The bars are rendered in a steel
    blue color (#306998) with slight transparency (alpha 0.8). The title "chart-export-menu
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis shows month abbreviations
    (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) with the label "Month" below. The y-axis shows "Sales ($)"
    ranging from 0 to approximately 160,000. The data shows variation across months
    with August having the highest sales (~157,000) and February the lowest (~54,000).
    There is a general upward trend throughout the year. The Bokeh toolbar is visible
    in the top-right corner showing pan, box zoom, wheel zoom, save, and reset icons
    - this is the export menu functionality. The grid has subtle horizontal dashed
    lines with good alpha. The layout uses the full 4800x2700 canvas well.
