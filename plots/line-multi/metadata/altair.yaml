review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with long-format data transformation
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue (#306998)
  - Combines line styles (strokeDash) with colors for additional differentiation
  - Proper font sizing throughout (18pt labels, 22pt titles, 28pt chart title)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic monthly sales data with distinct trends for each product line
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols show filled circles which do not clearly match the line stroke
    colors in the chart
  - Could add tooltips for better interactivity in the HTML version
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace when minimum data is around
