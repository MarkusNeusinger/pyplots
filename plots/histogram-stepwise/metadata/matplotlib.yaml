review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of histtype="step" to create clean outline-only histograms
  - Two overlapping distributions demonstrate the key advantage of step histograms
    (comparison without visual clutter)
  - Appropriate line width (3) makes steps clearly visible
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Realistic temperature data scenario that is immediately understandable
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper right may overlap with data in some cases; consider
    upper left or outside plot
  - Both distributions have similar shapes (normal); varying the spread or adding
    a third distribution would better showcase the comparison capability
  image_description: The plot displays two step histograms comparing temperature distributions.
    The blue line ("Morning") shows a distribution centered around 15°C with a peak
    frequency of ~29, while the yellow/gold line ("Afternoon") shows a distribution
    centered around 22-24°C with a peak frequency of ~24. Both distributions are rendered
    as step outlines only (no fill), creating clean overlapping comparisons. The title
    reads "histogram-stepwise · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. X-axis shows
    "Temperature (°C)" ranging from ~5 to ~37, Y-axis shows "Frequency" ranging from
    0 to 30. A legend in the upper right identifies the two series. A subtle dashed
    grid aids readability.
