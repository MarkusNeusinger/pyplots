review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data design: four deliberately different distribution shapes (bimodal,
    normal, clustered, skewed) that showcase the violin plot core strength'
  - Custom cohesive color palette with intentional ordering by median salary
  - Clean lets-plot grammar with proper font sizing, minimal theme, and dollar-formatted
    axis
  - Quartile lines drawn natively using lets-plot quantile_lines API
  weaknesses:
  - Quartile lines inside violins could be more visually distinct from the outline
  - Horizontal gridlines still at default weight; could be more subtle
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally showing
    salary distributions across four departments: Engineering (steel blue), Design
    (sea green), Marketing (golden yellow), and Sales (salmon/coral). The violins
    are ordered left to right by descending median salary. Engineering shows a clear
    bimodal distribution with peaks around $70k (junior) and $117k (senior). Design
    has a roughly normal/bell-shaped distribution centered around $80-85k. Marketing
    shows a main mass around $70k with a small secondary bump at higher values (~$105k).
    Sales displays a right-skewed distribution with most mass in the $50-70k range
    tapering upward. Each violin has three horizontal quartile lines (25th, 50th,
    75th percentiles) drawn inside. The y-axis is formatted with dollar signs and
    commas ($10,000-$170,000). The background uses a minimal theme with subtle horizontal
    gridlines only. No legend is shown; x-axis labels identify departments. The title
    reads "violin-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" at the top.'
