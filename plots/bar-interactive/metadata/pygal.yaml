review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Style class for comprehensive customization (font sizes,
    colors, transitions)
  - Custom tooltips with detailed information (value + YoY growth percentage) via
    label parameter
  - Clean, professional visual appearance with appropriate spacing and margins
  - Dual output format (PNG for static, HTML for full interactivity)
  - Good data context with realistic product sales scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner appears isolated from the main chart area
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent (dotted style) and could be more subtle
  - Font sizes in the Style definition are much larger than the library guide suggests
    (72 vs 28 for title)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an interactive bar chart showing Q4 sales
    data across 8 product categories. The bars are rendered in a consistent blue color
    (#306998) with the categories arranged horizontally: Electronics ($12,500), Clothing
    ($8,900), Home & Garden ($6,700), Sports ($5,400), Books ($4,200), Toys ($3,800),
    Health ($3,100), and Food ($2,800). The title "bar-interactive · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The Y-axis shows "Sales (USD)" with values ranging from
    0 to 12,000+, and the X-axis displays "Product Category". A legend labeled "Q4
    Sales" appears in the top-left corner. Horizontal dotted grid lines aid value
    reading. The layout is clean with good use of whitespace and balanced margins.'
