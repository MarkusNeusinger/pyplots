review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal bar orientation making category labels highly readable
  - Clean sorting implementation with clear visual hierarchy from largest to smallest
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability as recommended in spec
  - Professional styling with removed spines, subtle grid, and white edge color on
    bars
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - Data scenario is somewhat generic (product categories with random values); could
    use a more specific real-world dataset
  - Does not demonstrate any advanced matplotlib features beyond basic bar chart functionality
  image_description: The plot shows a horizontal bar chart with 8 product categories
    sorted in descending order by sales revenue. The largest bar (Storage) is at the
    top with $764K, followed by Furniture ($585K), Office Supplies ($420K), Printing
    ($271K), Software ($256K), Electronics ($252K), Accessories ($221K), and Networking
    ($170K) at the bottom. The bars are colored in a consistent blue shade (#306998).
    Each bar has a value label positioned to its right. The title reads "bar-sorted
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis shows "Sales Revenue ($ thousands)"
    and the y-axis shows "Product Category". A subtle dashed grid is visible on the
    x-axis. The top and right spines are removed for a cleaner look.
