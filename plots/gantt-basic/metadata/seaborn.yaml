review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a Gantt chart using seaborn barplot with creative
    use of date2num conversion for positioning
  - Well-chosen software development project scenario with realistic task durations
    and overlapping activities
  - Colorblind-friendly custom palette with 6 distinct category colors
  - Proper use of matplotlib.dates for date formatting and axis locators
  - Clean Today indicator line with dashed style and good visibility
  - Tasks logically sorted by start date for easy reading
  - Proper axis inversion to show first tasks at top
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in lower right overlaps with the Frontend Development and Backend
    Development bars - should be moved outside the plot area or to upper right
  - The grid on y-axis (alpha=0.15) is unnecessary for a Gantt chart and adds visual
    noise
