review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of the chirp signal with frequency increasing over time (diagonal
    yellow band is unmistakable)
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Proper dB scale labeling on colorbar with actual dB values (-100 to -10 dB range)
  - Clean code structure with scipy spectrogram computation
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Appropriate downsampling for Highcharts heatmap performance
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines on the heatmap area (would improve readability at specific time/frequency
    points)
  - Y-axis shows frequencies up to ~469 Hz but the chirp only goes to 200 Hz (wasted
    vertical space showing noise)
  image_description: The spectrogram displays a heatmap of a linear chirp signal.
    The plot shows time (0.06 to 1.91 seconds) on the x-axis and frequency (0 to ~469
    Hz) on the y-axis. A clear diagonal yellow band sweeps from low frequencies at
    early times to high frequencies at later times, representing the increasing frequency
    of the chirp signal. The background is predominantly teal/green (mid-power levels)
    with scattered darker blue/purple spots (low power). A vertical colorbar on the
    right shows "Power (dB)" ranging from approximately -100 dB (purple) to -10 dB
    (yellow), using a viridis colormap. The title reads "spectrogram-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Linear chirp signal (10-200 Hz) with linear frequency
    axis".
