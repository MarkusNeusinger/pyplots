review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with clear section comments
  - Excellent color palette with good contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Proper use of pygal Style class for comprehensive customization
  - Percentage labels are well-positioned and clearly readable inside slices
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears relatively small compared to the pie chart; could increase
    legend_font_size for better readability
  - Missing slight explosion for emphasis on key slice as suggested in the specification
    notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart showing market share distribution
    across 5 products. The chart uses a square format (3600x3600px) with distinct
    colors: blue (#306998) for Product A (35%), yellow (#FFD43B) for Product B (25%),
    teal (#4ECDC4) for Product C (20%), coral/red (#FF6B6B) for Product D (12%), and
    mint green (#95E1D3) for Product E (8%). Each slice displays its percentage value
    centered within the slice. The title "pie-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in dark gray text. A horizontal legend at the bottom identifies all
    5 products with their corresponding color indicators arranged in 5 columns.'
