review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of lets-plot distinctive features: stat-based ordering via as_discrete,
    layer_tooltips with stat variables, flavor theme'
  - Strong data storytelling with median annotations, overall mean reference line,
    and percentage comparison insight
  - Wong colorblind-safe palette ensures accessibility
  - Clean code structure with realistic salary data scenario
  - Boxes ordered by median provides natural narrative flow
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor text proximity issue: Avg label and insight annotation slightly crowd the
    Engineering box area'
  - Some wasted whitespace on the right side of the canvas — layout could be tighter
  - Annotation DataFrames are somewhat verbose (three separate DataFrames for text
    layers)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots showing salary distributions
    across departments (HR, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Engineering), ordered left-to-right
    by ascending median salary. Each box uses a distinct color from the Wong colorblind-safe
    palette: teal (HR), golden yellow (Marketing), orange (Sales), pink (Finance),
    blue (Engineering). Outliers appear as large filled circles above and below whiskers.
    A dashed gray horizontal reference line marks the overall average salary (~$71,502)
    with a label "Avg: $71,502" near the right side. Median dollar values ($54,599
    to $85,333) are annotated in bold above each box. A bold italic insight annotation
    "Eng. +56% vs. HR" highlights the salary gap between highest and lowest median
    departments. Title reads "box-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Salary
    distributions across five departments, ordered by median". Y-axis is "Annual Salary
    (USD)" with dollar formatting, X-axis is "Department". Clean white background
    with subtle horizontal gridlines.'
