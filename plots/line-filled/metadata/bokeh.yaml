review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's varea glyph for the filled area effect
  - Clean implementation with ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Interactive HTML output with HoverTool showing formatted visitor counts
  - Proper font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low alpha
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with seasonal variation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Website Visitors (count)" or "Month of Year")
  - Could use more distinctive Bokeh features like CustomJS, band annotations, or
    span annotations to highlight peaks
