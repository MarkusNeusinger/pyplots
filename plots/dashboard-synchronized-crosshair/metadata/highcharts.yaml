review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of synchronized crosshair functionality across three
    charts
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: plotBands for RSI overbought/oversold
    zones, datetime x-axis, column chart for volume'
  - Clean visual design with appropriate chart types for each data series (line for
    price, column for volume, area for RSI)
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Realistic financial data scenario with correlated series
  weaknesses:
  - The legends appear below each chart which is functional but takes up extra vertical
    space
  - Some wasted whitespace on the right margin
  image_description: The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with three
    vertically stacked charts sharing a common x-axis (time from January to July 2024).
    The top chart shows a blue line chart for "Price" with y-axis labeled "Price ($)"
    ranging from approximately 86 to 110, displaying a stock price random walk pattern.
    The middle chart displays yellow/gold column bars for "Volume" with values in
    millions (0 to 15M), showing volume spikes that correlate with larger price movements.
    The bottom chart shows a purple area chart for "RSI Indicator" with a 0-100 scale,
    featuring light purple shaded bands marking "Overbought" (70-100) and "Oversold"
    (0-30) zones. The main dashboard title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears prominently at the top in bold black text. Each chart has
    its own subtitle (Price, Volume, RSI Indicator), legend, and well-labeled axes
    with date formatting showing weekly intervals (e.g., "Jan 01", "Jan 08", "Feb
    05"). Grid lines are subtle gray (#e0e0e0). The layout uses a white background
    with good visual separation between charts. The synchronized crosshair functionality
    is implemented through JavaScript event handlers that coordinate hover states
    across all three charts.
