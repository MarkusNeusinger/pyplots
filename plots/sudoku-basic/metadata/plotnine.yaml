review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with thick/thin line differentiation for 3×3 boxes
    vs cells
  - Clean monochrome design perfect for printing as specified
  - Numbers are bold and well-centered within cells
  - Proper y-axis flipping to place row 0 at top (standard Sudoku orientation)
  - Square aspect ratio is ideal for Sudoku grid
  - Uses a valid, real Sudoku puzzle as sample data
  weaknesses:
  - Could use slightly lighter gray for thin lines to increase contrast with thick
    lines
  - The figure_size could be larger for even better resolution at 300 DPI
