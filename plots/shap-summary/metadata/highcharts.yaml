review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of SHAP summary plot using scatter series with color-coded
    bins
  - Well-chosen realistic context (house price prediction) with meaningful feature
    names
  - Proper sorting of features by mean absolute SHAP value (most important at top)
  - Clear visual separation using vertical line at x=0
  - Good use of jittering to reduce point overlap
  - Correct title format and professional subtitle
  - Properly saves both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Blue-red color scheme, while conventional for SHAP, is not optimal for colorblind
    accessibility (consider viridis or plasma alternatives in future)
  - All features show similar linear correlation patterns - more diverse SHAP distributions
    (e.g., some features with non-linear effects, clustered values) would better demonstrate
    the plot type capabilities
