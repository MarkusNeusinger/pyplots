review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar for geographic visualization with
    topo_feature and transform_lookup
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle with proper structure
  - Uses real-world vega_datasets unemployment data providing authentic, meaningful
    visualization
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate font sizes and gradient dimensions
  - Appropriate Albers USA projection for US county-level maps
  - Good color scheme (blues) that is colorblind-accessible and appropriate for sequential
    data
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels show decimal values (0.04, 0.08) which represent percentages but
    could be clearer as 4%, 8% for better readability
  - Missing explicit handling for missing data counties (spec suggests showing as
    gray)
  - Could leverage Altair's interactive features (.interactive() for zoom/pan or selection
    highlights) to better showcase library strengths
