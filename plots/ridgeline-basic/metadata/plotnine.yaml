review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with meaningful cool-to-warm color gradient that reinforces
    the seasonal temperature narrative
  - Perfect implementation of the ridgeline pattern using geom_ribbon with appropriate
    overlap (~60%)
  - Clean, readable layout with proper text sizing and minimal grid lines
  - Realistic monthly temperature data that effectively demonstrates the plot type's
    purpose
  - Proper use of plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_ribbon + scale_fill_manual
    + theme)
  weaknesses:
  - Baseline lines visible at each ridge level create minor visual noise (the dark
    horizontal lines at y=0 for each month)
  - Manual KDE computation using scipy.stats rather than leveraging plotnine's native
    density statistics
