review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of dendrogram using XY chart segments - creative
    solution for a library without native dendrogram support
  - Clean hierarchical clustering clearly separates the three iris species visually
  - Proper use of scipy linkage function with Ward method for accurate clustering
  - Well-configured custom Style with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - X-axis label rotation (45 degrees) prevents overlap while maintaining readability
  - Correct title format following pyplots convention
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines (y-guides) could be slightly more subtle - currently visible dotted
    lines are acceptable but could use lower opacity
  - The dendrogram branches in the lower portion are somewhat cramped compared to
    the upper sparse area - inherent to the data distribution
  image_description: The plot displays a well-formed dendrogram showing hierarchical
    clustering of 15 iris flower samples across three species (Setosa, Versicolor,
    Virginica). The visualization uses Python Blue (#306998) for all dendrogram branches
    against a clean white background. The title "dendrogram-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in a readable font. The y-axis is labeled "Distance (Ward's
    Method)" ranging from 0 to ~10, and the x-axis is labeled "Sample" with 15 rotated
    sample labels (45°). The tree structure clearly shows three main clusters corresponding
    to the three iris species, with Setosa samples clustering together on the left,
    followed by Versicolor in the middle, and Virginica on the right. Branch heights
    accurately reflect merge distances from Ward's method, with the final merge at
    distance ~10 connecting the Setosa cluster to the Versicolor-Virginica supercluster.
    Horizontal grid lines (y-guides) are subtle and aid in reading distance values.
