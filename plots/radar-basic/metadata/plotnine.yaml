review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using plotnine cartesian coordinates with
    manual polar transformation
  - Clean use of Python blue and yellow colors for colorblind accessibility
  - Proper polygon closure by repeating the first point
  - Well-implemented circular gridlines and radial spokes for reference
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.25) allowing overlap visibility as specified
  - Category labels positioned clearly outside the chart
  - Realistic employee performance review scenario with 6 meaningful competency categories
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels could be slightly larger (14pt to 16-18pt) for better readability
    at full resolution
  - No value labels on gridlines (e.g., 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) to help readers gauge
    values
