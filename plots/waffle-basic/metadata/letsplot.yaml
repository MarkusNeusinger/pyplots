review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waffle chart using geom_tile with proper grid construction
  - Perfect legend formatting showing category names with percentages
  - Clean color palette starting with Python Blue (#306998) as required
  - Proper use of theme_void() for waffle chart aesthetics
  - Correct 10x10 grid (100 squares = 1% each) as specified
  - Good use of pd.Categorical to preserve category order in legend
  - Saves both PNG and HTML for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Could add interactive tooltips (tooltip parameter) to leverage lets-plot interactivity
    features
  - Canvas utilization could be slightly improved - waffle grid appears a bit small
    relative to total canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10x10 waffle chart (100 squares total) representing
    market share by product category. The grid uses four distinct colors: **Python
    Blue (#306998)** for Product A occupying the top 42 squares (42%), **yellow (#FFD43B)**
    for Product B taking 28 squares, **green (#4CAF50)** for Product C with 18 squares,
    and **coral/orange (#FF7043)** for Product D with 12 squares at the bottom. The
    squares are arranged in a clean grid with small gaps between them. The title "waffle-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. A well-formatted legend
    on the right side shows each category with its percentage (e.g., "Product A (42%)").
    The layout uses a white/void background with the waffle grid centered.'
