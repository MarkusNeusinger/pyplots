review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation of raincloud plot using pygal XY chart capabilities,
    demonstrating how to achieve complex statistical visualizations in a library not
    designed for them
  - 'Properly implements all three components: half-violin density (with manual KDE),
    jittered scatter points, and complete box plots with whiskers and caps'
  - Realistic and meaningful data scenario (reaction times across treatment groups)
    with appropriate outliers to showcase the visualization
  - Good use of pygal Style system for consistent, high-resolution output with appropriate
    font sizing
  - Proper colorblind-friendly palette with distinct colors for each group
  weaknesses:
  - Legend not rendering visibly in the output despite being configured (legend_at_bottom=True,
    show_legend=True) - groups can only be identified via x-axis labels
  - Box plot median lines could be more visually distinct from the quartile box edges
    for easier statistical interpretation
