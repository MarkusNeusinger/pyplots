review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular parliament visualization with clean concentric arcs
  - Uses neutral non-political data context (board divisions instead of political
    parties)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct, visually appealing colors
  - Legend clearly shows division names with seat counts in parentheses
  - Includes majority threshold annotation and total seats information
  - Good use of theme_void for clean presentation
  - Proper aspect ratio with coord_fixed
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (one word)
  - Seats are distributed by row rather than strictly left-to-right across the semicircle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    5 concentric arcs of dots representing 400 total seats. The seats are colored
    by 6 divisions: Finance Committee (blue, 85 seats), Technology Board (yellow,
    72 seats), Operations Division (orange, 58 seats), Research Council (light blue,
    35 seats), Marketing Team (red, 95 seats), and Legal Advisory (purple, 55 seats).
    The title "parliament-basic · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    A legend on the right shows each division with its seat count. A horizontal baseline/majority
    line is drawn at y=0, and annotation text below reads "Total: 400 seats | Majority:
    201". The chart uses a white background with theme_void styling.'
