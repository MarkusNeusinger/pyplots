review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a cohesive financial dashboard demonstrating diverse
    plot types in a grid
  - Clean code structure with good use of ColumnDataSource for all subplots
  - Effective color scheme using Python blue/yellow with meaningful semantic colors
    for risk categories
  - Proper dual output (PNG and HTML) for both static and interactive viewing
  - Well-organized data generation with realistic financial relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Main title placement is unconventional (added to first subplot rather than as
    true grid title) causing slight visual asymmetry
  - Individual subplot dimensions (2400x1350 each) result in a total grid size that
    may not match the target 4800x2700 exactly
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid financial dashboard with four distinct
    visualizations: (1) Top-left shows a blue line chart with data points tracking
    stock price from ~$105 down to ~$85 over 60 trading days; (2) Top-right displays
    yellow/gold vertical bars representing daily trading volume in millions; (3) Bottom-left
    presents a color-coded scatter plot (green for high performers >8%, red for low
    <5%, blue for mid-range) showing risk vs return analysis; (4) Bottom-right shows
    a blue histogram of daily returns with a roughly normal distribution centered
    near 0%. The main title "subplot-grid · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears above the
    top-left subplot.'
