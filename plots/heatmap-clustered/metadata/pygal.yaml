review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological data representation with meaningful gene expression patterns
    (tumor suppressors vs oncogenes)
  - Both row and column dendrograms correctly implemented showing hierarchical clustering
  - Smooth diverging colormap with proper interpolation between blue-white-red
  - Clean separation of Normal vs Tumor samples through clustering
  - Advanced pygal usage extending base Graph class for custom visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Custom class implementation violates KISS principle, though justified by pygal
    lack of native heatmap support
  - Blue-red colormap could be replaced with more colorblind-friendly alternatives
  - Column labels at 60 degrees are readable but slightly cramped
