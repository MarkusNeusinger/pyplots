review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of EAN-13 encoding with proper L/G/R code patterns
  - Guard bars correctly rendered taller than data bars
  - Human-readable digits properly positioned with first digit outside left guard
  - Clean white background with good contrast
  - Proper quiet zones implemented
  - Well-centered layout with balanced proportions
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate the check digit calculation feature by using a 12-digit input
    code
  - Limited use of Bokeh-specific interactive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a standard EAN-13 barcode on a white background
    with the title "barcode-ean13 · bokeh · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The barcode
    consists of black vertical bars of varying widths encoding the German product
    number "4006381333931". The guard patterns (start, center, and end) are rendered
    taller than the data bars as per EAN-13 standard. Human-readable digits are displayed
    below the barcode: the first digit "4" is positioned outside the left guard, "006381"
    is centered under the left data section, and "333931" is centered under the right
    data section. The barcode is horizontally centered in the canvas with adequate
    quiet zones on both sides. Text is rendered in a monospace font in black color.'
