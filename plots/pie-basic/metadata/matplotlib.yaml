review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of spec-required features: percentage labels, distinct colors,
    legend, and exploded slice'
  - Clean visual design with white edge lines separating slices
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette with sufficient contrast
  - Category labels positioned clearly without overlap
  - Percentage labels are bold white for good readability
  - Appropriate square format for pie charts
  - Title correctly follows required format
  weaknesses:
  - Generic product names instead of more realistic category names
  - Could use shadow or additional visual enhancements
  - Legend title is generic - could match data context
