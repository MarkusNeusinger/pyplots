review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram concept using manual bin calculation
    and geom_line
  - Two overlaid distributions clearly demonstrate the key use case of comparing distributions
    without visual overlap
  - Strong color contrast between blue and yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of ggplot grammar with clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic temperature comparison scenario that makes immediate sense
  - Text sizing and layout are publication-quality
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for the HTML output
  - Legend title is slightly generic compared to a more descriptive label
  image_description: The plot displays two step histogram distributions comparing
    morning and afternoon temperature readings. The morning distribution (dark blue/navy
    line) is centered around 18°C with a peak frequency near 58, while the afternoon
    distribution (golden yellow line) is centered around 26°C with a peak frequency
    near 52. Both distributions are rendered as connected step lines (outline only,
    no fill) creating a classic step function appearance. The x-axis shows "Temperature
    (°C)" ranging from 4 to 40, and the y-axis shows "Frequency" ranging from 0 to
    60. A legend on the right identifies "Morning" and "Afternoon" under "Time Period".
    The title reads "histogram-stepwise · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The background uses
    a minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.

          which is slightly generic; legend placement is good

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_line, scale_color_manual,
          theme_minimal, and custom theme elements; however, doesn't leverage lets-plot's
          interactive tooltips or other distinctive features beyond basic ggplot grammar
  verdict: APPROVED
