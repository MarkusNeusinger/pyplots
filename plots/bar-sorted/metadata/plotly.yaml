review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal bar orientation choice for category labels readability
  - Clean sorting implementation with numpy argsort
  - Professional appearance with Python Blue color scheme and subtle borders
  - Proper use of Plotly graph_objects for fine-grained control
  - Value labels positioned outside bars improve readability
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai standards
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for maximum utility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (current alpha 0.1 is good but
    gridwidth=1 makes them slightly prominent)'
