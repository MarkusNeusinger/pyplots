review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, correct ECDF implementation with proper step function using where="post"
  - Excellent text sizing and readability following matplotlib guidelines exactly
  - Helpful quartile reference lines (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) that add value for reading
    percentiles
  - Colorblind-safe color choices with good contrast
  - Follows KISS structure perfectly with clean, readable code
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label "Value" is generic and lacks units (could be more descriptive)
  - Data scenario is generic random samples rather than a real-world context (e.g.,
    test scores, response times)
  - Does not use matplotlib.pyplot.ecdf (available since 3.8) which would demonstrate
    matplotlib-specific functionality
