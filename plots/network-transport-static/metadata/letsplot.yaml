review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic transit network data with meaningful station names and plausible
    schedules
  - Good use of lets-plot layer_tooltips for interactive hover information
  - Clear color-coding scheme distinguishing Express, Regional, and Local routes
  - Proper implementation of directed edges with arrows showing travel direction
  - Clean visual design with theme_void() appropriate for network diagrams
  - Offset edges for duplicate routes (A→C) showing RE2 and RE5
  weaknesses:
  - Edge labels are relatively small and some overlap near Central station where routes
    converge
  - The offset for duplicate routes (A→C) could be more pronounced to better distinguish
    parallel edges
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (minor consistency issue)
  - Some edge label text could be larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static transport network diagram with 10
    stations (nodes) arranged in a grid-like pattern: Central in the middle, North/South/East/West
    at cardinal positions, and University, Airport, Tech Park, Harbor, and Stadium
    as outer stations. Station nodes are rendered as dark gray filled circles with
    white borders, with station names displayed below each node in bold black text.
    Directed edges (arrows) connect stations showing train routes, color-coded by
    route type: blue for Express routes, gold/ochre for Regional routes, and green
    for Local routes. Each edge is labeled with route ID and departure/arrival times
    (e.g., "RE1 | 06:15 → 06:35"). The title "network-transport-static · lets-plot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. A legend on the right side shows the
    three route types. The plot uses theme_void() for a clean white background with
    no axes or grid.'
