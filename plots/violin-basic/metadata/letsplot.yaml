review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with clean, readable code structure
  - Proper quartile lines (25th, 50th, 75th percentile) clearly visible inside each
    violin as required by spec
  - Realistic salary distribution data that tells a coherent story (Engineering highest,
    Sales widest spread)
  - Good color choice with sufficient alpha for visibility
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output using ggsize(1600,900) with scale=3
  - Clean minimal theme that does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (minor formatting issue)
  - Color palette only uses 2 alternating colors for 4 categories which could cause
    confusion about category groupings
  - Star import (from lets_plot import *) is functional but less explicit than named
    imports
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes representing salary distributions
    across four departments: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Design. The violins
    are colored in a two-color palette alternating between blue (#306998) and yellow
    (#FFD43B). Each violin shows the kernel density estimation with mirrored sides,
    and horizontal lines at three positions (25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile)
    are visible within each violin. The title "violin-basic · lets-plot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The y-axis shows "Salary ($)" ranging from 0 to 170,000, and
    the x-axis shows "Department" with the four category labels. The layout uses a
    minimal theme with a white background and subtle gridlines.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2-style grammar, quantiles parameter, quantile_lines,
          scale_fill_manual, theme customization. Could leverage more lets-plot specific
          features like interactivity options or additional styling.
