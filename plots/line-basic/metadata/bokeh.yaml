review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 resolution with clear, readable fonts throughout
  - Clean, professional styling with subtle dashed grid lines and light background
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource which is idiomatic Bokeh
  - Realistic temperature data scenario that matches spec examples
  - Correct title format and proper axis labels with units
  - Markers with white borders provide good visibility and visual appeal
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Bokeh distinctive hover tooltip feature which could enhance
    the static export
  - No legend present (minor issue for single series)
  - Data pattern (warmest mid-month) is slightly artificial for typical monthly weather
    data
  image_description: The plot displays a basic line chart showing daily temperature
    readings over 31 days of a month. A blue line (#306998) connects all data points,
    with small circular markers at each point featuring white borders. The title "line-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The X-axis is labeled "Day
    of Month" ranging from 0 to ~31, and the Y-axis is labeled "Temperature (°C)"
    ranging from approximately 19°C to 30°C. The background is a subtle light gray
    (#fafafa) with dashed grid lines. The data shows a sinusoidal pattern with temperatures
    warmer mid-month (peaking around day 20-21 at ~30°C) and cooler at the start and
    end of the month (~19-21°C), with realistic daily variation/noise overlaid.

          (single series, so acceptable but not perfect)

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource which is good Bokeh practice, but doesn't leverage
          Bokeh's distinctive interactive features like hover tooltips or other interactive
          elements. For a static export, this is acceptable but not exceptional.
  verdict: APPROVED
