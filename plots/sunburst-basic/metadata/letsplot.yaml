review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear color progression from dark to light across
    levels
  - Proper use of white borders to separate segments making hierarchy relationships
    clear
  - Labels are well-positioned and readable with appropriate styling (bold white for
    inner, dark for outer)
  - Realistic organizational budget scenario that demonstrates the sunburst concept
    effectively
  - Clean implementation that produces a professional-looking chart
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper function (create_wedge) which violates the KISS principle of no functions/classes
  - Could benefit from a simple legend explaining the color-branch relationship
  - Some segments (like SMB, Retail) appear relatively small; could show more variation
    in data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sunburst chart with three concentric rings
    representing an organizational budget hierarchy. The innermost ring shows three
    main departments: **Eng** (dark blue), **Sales** (yellow/gold), and **Mktg** (green)
    - each with white bold text labels. The second ring shows subdivisions: Backend
    and Frontend for Eng (lighter blues), North and South for Sales (lighter yellows),
    and Digital and Brand for Mktg (lighter greens). The outermost ring displays projects/categories:
    API, Database, Web App, Mobile (blues), Enterprise, SMB, Retail (yellows), and
    SEO, Ads, Events (greens). White borders separate all segments clearly. The chart
    is centered on a clean white background with the title "sunburst-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" at the top.'
