review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Radar chart as polar-like visualization for cyclical data
  - Clean, well-structured code with appropriate custom styling for high-resolution
    output
  - Realistic hourly temperature data that demonstrates the value of polar visualization
  - Good use of square canvas (3600x3600) which is ideal for radial charts
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Filled area with appropriate opacity makes the pattern easily visible
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis labels (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) are on the small side relative to the canvas
  - Grid shows y-guides but could benefit from more prominent radial ring labels
  - Does not utilize pygal interactive tooltip features which are a distinctive library
    strength
