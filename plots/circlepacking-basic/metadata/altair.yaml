review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic company budget scenario with meaningful hierarchy (Root > Department
    > Team)
  - Good use of opacity gradients to distinguish hierarchy depth levels
  - Blue color scheme is colorblind-safe and visually appealing
  - Labels on team circles include both name and value for clarity
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Circles from different parent departments overlap incorrectly - circle
    packing requires children to be contained within parent circles without overlapping
    siblings from other parents'
  - The custom circle packing algorithm fails to properly nest circles, making the
    hierarchy relationships unclear
  - No legend to identify which circles belong to which department
  - Code structure violates KISS principle with multiple helper functions instead
    of linear flow
  - Department labels are missing from the visualization (only team labels shown)
