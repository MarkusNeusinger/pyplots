review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent creative solution: implements KDE-based contour density using custom
    SVG injection into pygal, working around pygal''s lack of native contour support'
  - High-quality visual output with smooth density gradient and clear contour lines
    using marching squares algorithm
  - Realistic weather sensor data scenario with three distinct clusters showing morning,
    midday, and evening readings
  - Proper colorbar with density scale values in scientific notation
  - Scatter point overlay provides context as suggested in the specification
  - Correct title format and well-labeled axes with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are not displayed, which could help with reading values
  - Scatter overlay points lack a legend entry explaining what they represent
  - Helper function used for color interpolation deviates slightly from pure KISS
    structure
