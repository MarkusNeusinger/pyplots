review:
  strengths:
  - Well-designed choropleth visualization with clear color gradient indicating performance
    levels
  - 'Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics: geom_polygon for states, geom_text
    for labels, scale_fill_gradient for color mapping'
  - Thoughtful breadcrumb navigation indicator showing hierarchical context
  - Clean code structure with comprehensive state polygon data
  - Good color accessibility with yellow-to-blue gradient
  - Appropriate acknowledgment in subtitle that interactive features require different
    library
  weaknesses:
  - Legend scale shows 65-90 but actual data range is 64-91, creating minor inconsistency
  - Some label overlap in dense regions (Midwest states)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha)
  - As a static library, plotnine cannot implement the interactive drill-down, tooltips,
    and zoom transitions specified
  image_description: The plot displays a choropleth-style map of the continental United
    States showing 20 states with simplified polygon boundaries. Each state is colored
    using a yellow-to-blue gradient based on "Performance Score" values ranging from
    64 to 91. States are labeled with their two-letter abbreviation and numeric score
    (e.g., "CA 85", "NY 91"). The title "map-drilldown-geographic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top with a subtitle explaining this is a static view. A breadcrumb
    navigation indicator "World > USA > States" is displayed in blue text in the upper
    left, with a smaller italic instruction about clicking to drill down. The color
    legend on the right shows the Performance Score scale from 65 to 90. Axes display
    longitude (120°W to 80°W) and latitude (25°N to 50°N) with a light blue-gray panel
    background and subtle grid lines.

        comment: Uses plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_polygon, geom_text, scale_fill_gradient,
          annotate, and comprehensive theming. Good use for static maps, but limited
          by static nature.
