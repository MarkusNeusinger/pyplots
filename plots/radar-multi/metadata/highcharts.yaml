quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of multi-series radar chart using Highcharts polar mode
    with area series
  - 'All specification requirements met: 4 distinct products, 6 axes, transparent
    fills (0.2), distinct colorblind-safe colors, legend, gridlines at 20-unit intervals'
  - Square 3600x3600 format is well-suited for radar visualization
  - 'Proper use of gridLineInterpolation: polygon for radar-style gridlines'
  - Both inline JS for PNG export and CDN-based interactive HTML version provided
  - 'Data tells a coherent story: different product positioning strategies (premium,
    budget, balanced, feature-rich)'
  weaknesses:
  - Gridline width (2) is slightly heavy for optimal subtlety; alpha 0.15 is good
    but combined with width 2 makes lines more prominent than ideal
  - Axis labels lack units (could add "(Score)" or similar for 0-100 scale clarity)
  - Data differentiation could be more dramatic - some values cluster in the 50-80
    range
  - Uses container.screenshot() instead of driver.save_screenshot() per library rules
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart with a white background.
    The title "Product Comparison · radar-multi · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top in bold black text. The radar chart has 6 axes radiating from the center:
    Price, Quality, Durability, Support, Features, and Ease of Use. Four overlapping
    polygons represent four products: Product A (Premium) in blue (#306998), Product
    B (Budget) in yellow (#FFD43B), Product C (Balanced) in purple (#9467BD), and
    Product D (Feature-Rich) in cyan (#17BECF). Each polygon has a semi-transparent
    fill (~0.2 opacity) with visible outlines and data point markers. The gridlines
    form concentric polygons at intervals of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 (with subtle gray coloring).
    A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all four products with their colors and
    labels.'
  verdict: APPROVED
