review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with proper font sizes and colorblind-safe palette
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Proper axis labels as specified (Theoretical Quantiles and Sample Quantiles)
  - Reference line (y=x) is clearly visible and properly labeled in legend
  - Data demonstrates right-skewed distribution deviation from normality
  - Good marker sizing (s=200) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Manual implementation of inverse normal CDF adds unnecessary complexity when scipy.stats.norm.ppf
    could be used (though acceptable for dependency-free code)
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features beyond basic scatterplot
  - Data example shows only right skewness but not other Q-Q characteristics like
    heavy tails or S-curves mentioned in specification
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot with 200 blue
    scatter points (color #306998) plotted against theoretical normal distribution
    quantiles. A yellow dashed reference line (y=x, color #FFD43B) runs diagonally
    from lower-left to upper-right. The X-axis is labeled "Theoretical Quantiles"
    and the Y-axis is labeled "Sample Quantiles", both ranging approximately from
    -3 to +3. The title correctly follows the format "qq-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    Points follow the reference line closely in the center but deviate above the line
    in the upper right tail, demonstrating the intended right skewness from the mixture
    distribution. A legend in the upper-left corner indicates "Reference (y=x)". The
    grid uses subtle dashed lines with low alpha. The plot uses the full 16:9 canvas
    effectively with balanced margins.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot() which is seaborn's axes-level function, but
          does not leverage seaborn's statistical capabilities like regplot or more
          distinctive seaborn features
  verdict: APPROVED
