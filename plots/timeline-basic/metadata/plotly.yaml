review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alternating label positions above/below the axis to
    prevent text overlap
  - Clean use of Plotly annotation system for event labels and date labels
  - Interactive hover templates showing formatted dates enhance usability
  - Color scheme effectively distinguishes the four project phases
  - Proper use of go.Scatter for both the timeline axis and event markers
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow markers (#FFD43B) have lower contrast against white background
  - Vertical grid lines could be more subtle or removed for cleaner appearance
  - Could leverage Plotly interactivity more (e.g., range slider for zooming dense
    timelines)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization of a software
    project spanning January to December 2024. Twelve milestones are represented as
    colored circular markers along a dark horizontal axis line. Events are alternately
    positioned above and below the axis to prevent text overlap. Four categories are
    distinguished by color: Planning (blue - #306998), Development (yellow - #FFD43B),
    Testing (teal - #4ECDC4), and Release (red-orange - #E74C3C). Each milestone has
    its event name label and a smaller date label (e.g., "Jan 15"). The title "timeline-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center, with a horizontal legend showing
    all four categories below it. The x-axis shows months from January to December
    with "Project Timeline (2024)" as the axis title. Dotted vertical lines connect
    each marker to its labels. The overall design is clean with a white background.'
