review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good use of viridis colormap for time progression (colorblind-safe)
  - Clear start (green circle) and end (red square) markers with adequate sizing
  - Direction arrows effectively indicate travel direction
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic hiking trail scenario with appropriate coordinate scale
  weaknesses:
  - The connecting line (lineplot) is quite faint with alpha=0.5 and only linewidth=2,
    making the path continuity less visible than the scatter points
  - Does not leverage distinctive seaborn features - the colorbar and annotations
    are all matplotlib; seaborn is only used for basic line/scatter plots
  - The equal aspect ratio causes some whitespace imbalance
  image_description: The plot displays a route path map visualizing a hiking trail
    GPS track in the NYC/Central Park area. The route is shown as a connected path
    with 200 waypoints, starting from the lower-left (marked with a large green circle
    labeled "Start") and ending at the upper-right (marked with a red square labeled
    "End"). The waypoints are colored using the viridis colormap to show time progression
    - purple/dark blue for the beginning (0 minutes), transitioning through cyan/teal
    in the middle, and ending with yellow/green at approximately 80 minutes. A vertical
    colorbar on the right displays "Elapsed Time (minutes)" from 0 to ~80. Four blue
    direction arrows are visible along the path indicating travel direction. The axes
    show Longitude (°) on x-axis ranging from -73.96 to -73.86 and Latitude (°) on
    y-axis ranging from 40.79 to 40.83. A subtle gray dashed grid is present. The
    title correctly shows "map-route-path · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
