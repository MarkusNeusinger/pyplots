review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic hiking trail scenario with plausible NYC coordinates
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart type for coordinate plotting
  - Good canvas utilization and layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - Color gradient segments are not visible in the output - the entire path appears
    as one continuous blue line instead of 5 distinct colored segments showing time
    progression
  - Start and end markers (green/red dots) are not clearly visible or distinguishable
    from the path
  - Legend text is extremely small and positioned in the corner, making it difficult
    to read
  - Axis labels lack units (should be "Longitude (degrees)" and "Latitude (degrees)")
  - Missing basemap context as specified (though this may be a pygal limitation)
  image_description: The plot displays a hiking trail route rendered as a closed loop
    path on an XY coordinate system representing a Central Park loop. The path is
    rendered in a single blue color with connected line segments showing GPS coordinates.
    The x-axis shows Longitude ranging from approximately -73.986 to -73.956 degrees,
    and the y-axis shows Latitude ranging from approximately 40.75 to 40.79 degrees.
    The title "map-route-path · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center.
    A legend appears in the top-left corner showing "Hiking Trail", "Start", and "End"
    items, though these are very small and difficult to read. The route forms an elongated
    loop shape with GPS noise visible. Notably, the color gradient segments from the
    code are NOT visible - the entire path appears as one continuous blue line rather
    than 5 distinct colored segments. The start and end markers are also not clearly
    visible as distinct points.
