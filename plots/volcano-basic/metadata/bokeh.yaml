review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of volcano plot with all required threshold lines and
    color coding
  - Well-scaled for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriately sized text and markers
  - Clean separation of data into three ColumnDataSources enables proper legend handling
  - Realistic simulated gene expression data with correlation between fold change
    magnitude and significance
  - Proper use of alpha transparency for dense data visualization
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Red/blue color scheme not optimal for colorblind accessibility - consider using
    colorblind-safe palette
  - 'Missing optional feature: labeling of top significant genes by name as suggested
    in spec notes'
  - No hover tooltips to identify individual points - a key Bokeh interactive feature
  image_description: 'The volcano plot displays 2000 simulated gene expression data
    points. The x-axis shows "Log₂ Fold Change" ranging from approximately -4 to 6,
    and the y-axis shows "-Log₁₀ (P-value)" ranging from 0 to about 2.6. Three categories
    of points are color-coded: gray points (Not significant) form a dense cloud in
    the center/lower portion, blue points (Down-regulated) appear in the upper-left
    quadrant representing genes with negative fold changes and high significance,
    and red points (Up-regulated) appear in the upper-right quadrant representing
    genes with positive fold changes and high significance. Three dashed threshold
    lines are present: a horizontal line at approximately y=1.3 (p-value threshold
    of 0.05) and vertical lines at x=±1 (fold change thresholds). The legend is positioned
    in the top-right corner with a light background. The overall background is a subtle
    light gray (#FAFAFA).'

        comment: Markers well-sized for 2000 points (size 18-25 with alpha 0.5-0.7),
