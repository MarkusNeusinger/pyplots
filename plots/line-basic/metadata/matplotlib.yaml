review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizes matching matplotlib.md guidelines
  - Clean seasonal temperature data creates a realistic, easy-to-understand example
  - Dual-color marker design (yellow fill, blue edge) provides attractive visual distinction
  - Proper use of Axes methods (ax.plot, ax.set_*) rather than pyplot functions
  - Correct title format matching spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Data is quite smooth; adding slightly more random variation could better demonstrate
    how line plots handle noisy data
  - Could use additional matplotlib features like fill_between for confidence intervals
    or ax.annotate for peak/trough labeling to score higher on library features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic line chart showing monthly temperature
    readings throughout a year. A single blue line (#306998) connects 12 data points,
    each marked with a yellow (#FFD43B) circular marker with a blue border. The chart
    demonstrates a classic seasonal temperature pattern: starting low in January (~4°C),
    rising through spring and summer to peak in July (~29°C), then declining through
    autumn back to winter lows in December (~4°C). The title reads "line-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. X-axis shows abbreviated month names (Jan-Dec),
    Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" with values ranging from approximately 5 to 30.
    A subtle dashed gray grid aids readability. Layout is clean with good whitespace.'

        comment: Good use of Axes methods, marker customization (markerfacecolor,
          markeredgecolor, markeredgewidth), but no advanced matplotlib features like
          annotations, fill_between, or secondary axes
  verdict: APPROVED
