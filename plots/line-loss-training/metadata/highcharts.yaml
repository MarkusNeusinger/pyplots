review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent overfitting visualization with clear divergence between training and
    validation curves after epoch 28
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between blue training line and yellow
    validation line
  - Informative subtitle showing optimal stopping point with precise validation loss
    value
  - Well-scaled markers and line widths appropriate for 50 data points
  - Proper use of Highcharts LineSeries with distinct marker symbols (circle vs square)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper right slightly crowds the visual area where the curves
    begin; positioning at right-middle or bottom would be cleaner
  - 'Grid lines could be more subtle (current gridLineColor #e0e0e0 is visible but
    acceptable)'
