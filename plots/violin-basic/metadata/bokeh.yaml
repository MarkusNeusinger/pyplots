review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of violin plot from first principles using Bokeh patch
    and segment glyphs
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (mirrored KDE, quartile boxes,
    median lines, whiskers)
  - Realistic salary distribution scenario with varied distribution shapes demonstrating
    plot type strengths
  - Clean, well-commented code with proper KDE bandwidth calculation (Silverman rule)
  - Good color choices with Python blue/yellow alternating pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis uses scientific notation (2.000e+4) instead of human-readable currency
    format
