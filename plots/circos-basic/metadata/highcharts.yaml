quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts dependency wheel module for circos-style visualization
  - Realistic global trade flow data with meaningful regional relationships (stronger
    NA-East Asia, Europe-East Asia connections)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for all 8 regions
  - Good canvas utilization with the 3600x3600 square format appropriate for circular
    chart
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Some region labels partially obscured by overlapping ribbons (North America, Middle
    East labels difficult to read)
  - Missing explicit legend to identify region colors
  - Spec mentions optional concentric tracks for additional data layers which are
    not implemented
  - Uses raw JSON configuration instead of highcharts_core Python library (though
    functional, less Pythonic)
