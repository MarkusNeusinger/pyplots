review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent mathematical surface with multiple features (peaks, valley, gradients)
    that clearly demonstrates filled contour capabilities
  - Proper use of viridis colormap which is colorblind-safe and perceptually uniform
  - Overlaid white contour lines with appropriate alpha for level identification as
    recommended in spec
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizes throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "X Position (units)" or use a more realistic
    application context)
  - Mathematical demonstration is generic rather than a compelling real-world scenario
    (e.g., topographic elevation, temperature field)
  - Could add contour labels (clabel) to show numerical values on contour lines
