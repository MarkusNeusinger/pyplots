review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of probability-based contour coloring rather than just discrete
    class regions
  - Clear decision boundary line at probability=0.5 with dashed styling
  - Good marker differentiation using both shape (circle vs diamond) and color
  - Professional colorbar showing class probability scale
  - Responsive layout with proper sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper-left overlaps slightly with some Class 0 data points
  - Could enhance interactivity by adding hover info to the contour regions showing
    probability values
