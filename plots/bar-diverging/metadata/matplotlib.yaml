review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: horizontal orientation, contrasting
    colors, zero baseline indicator, and sorted bars'
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good commenting
  - Value labels at bar ends enhance readability and make the chart immediately informative
  - Proper use of matplotlib-specific features (spines removal, axvline, Patch-based
    legend)
  - Realistic product satisfaction survey scenario with meaningful category names
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include context (e.g., Net Satisfaction Score (%)) to clarify
    the measurement scale
