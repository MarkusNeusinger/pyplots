review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Marimekko chart concept with proportional bar
    widths
  - Clean visual hierarchy with white segment borders providing clear separation
  - Smart conditional labeling only on segments large enough to display values
  - Professional color palette with Python blue as primary color
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs with interactive hover tooltips in HTML version
  - Region labels include total market size for context
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position overlaps slightly with the rightmost portion of the chart area
  - No y-axis scale to indicate percentage proportions (0-100%)
  - Hover tool is only useful in HTML output, not visible in PNG
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Marimekko chart showing market share data
    across 4 regions. Bar widths vary proportionally to market size: Asia Pacific
    (00B) is widest, followed by North America (00B), Europe (50B), and Latin America
    (50B) which is narrowest. Each bar is divided into 4 stacked segments representing
    product categories: Electronics (blue #306998), Apparel (yellow #FFD43B), Home
    & Garden (teal #4ECDC4), and Food & Beverage (coral #E8685D). Value labels (0B-00B)
    appear on larger segments in white bold text. Region names with total values are
    displayed below each bar. A legend in the upper right shows product categories.
    The title "marimekko-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at top.'
