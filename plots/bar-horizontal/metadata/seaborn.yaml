review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly sorted bars
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic programming language survey data that resonates with developers
  - Value labels positioned at bar ends enhance readability
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter to avoid warnings
  weaknesses:
  - Could highlight a specific bar (e.g., Python) to demonstrate the specification
    suggestion for drawing attention to specific categories
  - Uses seaborn primarily as a styling layer over matplotlib rather than leveraging
    seaborn statistical features
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing programming
    language popularity survey results. There are 10 horizontal bars in a consistent
    steel blue color (#306998), sorted from lowest (Kotlin at 12%) at the top to highest
    (Python at 68%) at the bottom. Each bar has a percentage label at its end. The
    y-axis shows "Programming Language" with language names (Kotlin, Swift, Rust,
    Go, TypeScript, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python), and the x-axis shows "Percentage
    of Respondents (%)" with values from 0 to 70. The title reads "bar-horizontal
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed grid is visible on the x-axis. Top and
    right spines are removed for a cleaner look.

          leverage seaborn-specific statistical features like confidence intervals
          or other advanced capabilities
