review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized bars, clear color coding, and readable
    labels at all sizes
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: correct Gantt chart implementation with all required
    features (task bars, categories, date formatting)'
  - Realistic software development project scenario demonstrates practical Gantt chart
    use
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with x/x2 temporal encoding for date ranges
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips showing task details enhances usability
  - Colorblind-safe palette using distinct hues (blue, yellow, green, red-orange,
    purple)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are functional but could be more descriptive (e.g., Project Timeline
    2024 instead of Timeline)
  - Could demonstrate more Altair-specific features like layered marks or selections
  - Minor whitespace imbalance between chart area and margins
