review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below timeline prevents overlap
  - Good color-coded category system with clear legend
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic software development milestone data
  - Clean temporal axis with month markers and year label
  - Effective use of dashed connector lines linking markers to labels
  weaknesses:
  - Timeline occupies only ~20% of vertical canvas height, leaving excessive whitespace
    above and below
  - Heavy reliance on manual SVG string injection rather than leveraging pygal native
    charting capabilities
  - Legend is positioned far from the main timeline content
