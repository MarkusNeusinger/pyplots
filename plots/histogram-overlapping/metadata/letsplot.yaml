review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario (A/B testing response times) that directly matches
    spec applications
  - Perfect transparency level (alpha=0.5) allows clear visualization of overlapping
    regions
  - High contrast colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility seed
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placed on right creates slight layout imbalance with extra whitespace
  - Grid lines extend beyond data area, could be more contained
  - Could leverage more lets-plot distinctive features (e.g., interactive tooltips
    in HTML output)
  image_description: 'The plot displays two overlapping histograms comparing response
    times between Control (steel blue, #306998) and Treatment (golden yellow, #FFD43B)
    groups. The Control distribution is centered around 450-480ms while the Treatment
    distribution is centered around 350-400ms, clearly showing faster response times
    for the treatment condition. The semi-transparent fills (alpha=0.5) create an
    olive/greenish overlap region where distributions intersect, effectively demonstrating
    the comparison. The title correctly follows the format "histogram-overlapping
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". Axis labels show "Response Time (ms)" on X and "Count"
    on Y. A legend on the right identifies the two conditions. The plot uses a minimal
    theme with subtle grid lines on a light background.'

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate, but legend title says "Condition"
          while the data column is named "group" - minor inconsistency; legend could
          be better integrated
