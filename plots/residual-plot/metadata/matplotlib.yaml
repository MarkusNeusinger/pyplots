review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including reference line, ±2σ
    bands, outlier highlighting, and trend line
  - Deliberately generated data with quadratic component to demonstrate non-linear
    residual pattern detection
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with clear data generation
    logic
  - Good visual design with colorblind-safe colors (blue/yellow) and appropriate transparency
    levels
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all visual elements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context (e.g., "Fitted Values (ŷ)" or
    similar notation)
  - Could demonstrate heteroscedasticity more clearly with variance that changes across
    fitted values
