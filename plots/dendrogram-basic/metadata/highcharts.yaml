  image_description: 'The plot displays a dendrogram (hierarchical clustering tree)
    with a white background. The title "dendrogram-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The Y-axis is labeled "Distance (Ward)" ranging from
    0 to approximately 10.75, and the X-axis is labeled "Sample". The dendrogram shows
    15 leaf nodes at the bottom representing iris flower samples: Setosa-4, Setosa-3,
    Setosa-5, Setosa-1, Setosa-2, Versicolor-1, Versicolor-4, Versicolor-5, Versicolor-2,
    Versicolor-3, Virginica-1, Virginica-3, Virginica-2, Virginica-4, and Virginica-5.
    The tree structure is drawn in Python Blue (#306998) with clear U-shaped connections
    showing the hierarchical merging pattern. The Setosa samples cluster together
    on the left, while Versicolor and Virginica samples form a separate major cluster
    on the right, with the two main clusters merging at the highest distance (~10).
    The branch heights correctly represent the Ward linkage distances. Labels are
    rotated at 45 degrees for readability.'
