review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual differentiation between species through distinct face colors (Set2
    palette)
  - Effective feature mapping clearly documented at bottom of plot
  - Well-organized 3x5 grid layout with species grouped by row for easy comparison
  - Title correctly formatted as spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
  - Uses seaborn heatmap (from original code) and styling features appropriately
  weaknesses:
  - Heatmap shown in code is missing from the rendered output - only faces grid is
    visible
  - Face sizes and shapes appear very similar within species despite intentional diverse
    sample selection
  - Setosa faces all have sad/frowning expressions while Virginica all have happy
    expressions - limited variation visible within species
