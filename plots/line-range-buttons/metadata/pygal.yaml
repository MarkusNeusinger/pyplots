review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the range selector concept with main chart + buttons
    + mini navigator
  - Good use of pygal's styling system with custom Style objects
  - Creative solution combining PIL with pygal for static PNG output
  - The HTML version provides full interactivity with working range buttons
  - 'Clean color scheme with consistent use of #306998 blue'
  - Range indicator overlay on mini chart clearly shows selected period
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text is truncated (shows "Daily Values (…" instead of full label)
  - The main chart's x-axis labels are not showing on the main chart area (only "Date"
    axis title appears, actual date ticks are missing from the main chart)
  - Gap between main chart and "Date" label seems unnecessarily large
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart with range selector
    buttons. The main chart shows the title "line-range-buttons · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    at the top, with a blue line tracing daily values over approximately one year.
    The Y-axis is labeled "Value" (ranging from ~112 to ~144), and the X-axis shows
    "Date". The legend text is truncated showing "Daily Values (…". Below the main
    chart is a range selector bar with buttons labeled "1M", "3M", "6M", "1Y" (highlighted
    in dark blue as currently selected), "YTD", and "All". At the bottom is a "Range
    Navigator — Full History" mini chart showing the full 2-year dataset (Jan '24
    to Dec '25), with the selected 1Y range highlighted in a semi-transparent blue
    overlay. The overall color scheme uses blue (#306998) consistently for the line,
    selected button, and range indicator.
