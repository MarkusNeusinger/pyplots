review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette
  - Correct implementation of vortex flow field physics (u = -y, v = x)
  - Good streamline density with distributed starting points avoiding origin singularity
  - Proper Highcharts chart configuration with appropriate sizing for 4800x2700
  - Clean title format following specification requirements
  - Interactive HTML output also saved for web viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function (trace_streamline) violating KISS principle -
    should be inline code
  - Y-axis actual data extends beyond the configured min/max, creating visual clipping
    at edges
  - All streamlines show identical circular pattern - could benefit from showing different
    starting radii more distinctly
  - No color encoding by velocity magnitude which was mentioned as an option in the
    spec notes
