review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy dendrogram() with no_plot=True to extract coordinates,
    then rendering with plotnine native geom_segment
  - Clean two-color scheme using Python branding colors that distinguishes high-level
    from low-level merges
  - Proper 45-degree label rotation prevents overlap while maintaining readability
  - Well-structured code following KISS principle with clear data generation for three
    iris species
  - Appropriate figure sizing (16x9) and font scaling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarify the distance metric more explicitly
  - The color threshold logic (0.7 * max) is somewhat arbitrary and unexplained visually
  - Bottom margin has extra whitespace due to rotated labels extending into the plot
    area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical dendrogram visualizing clustering
    of 15 iris flower samples (5 each of Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The tree
    structure uses a two-color scheme: Python Blue (#306998) for high-level merges
    at the top and Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for lower-level merges. The Y-axis shows
    "Distance (Ward)" ranging from 0 to 12, and the X-axis is labeled "Sample". Sample
    labels are displayed at 45-degree angles at the bottom (e.g., Setosa-4, Setosa-3,
    Versicolor-1, Virginica-1, etc.). The title reads "dendrogram-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai". The layout is clean with subtle dashed grid lines on the Y-axis.
    The dendrogram correctly shows Setosa samples clustering together on the left,
    while Versicolor and Virginica samples cluster on the right side, reflecting their
    biological similarity.'

        comment: Good use of geom_segment, geom_text, theme customization, and scale_color_manual.
          However, relies heavily on scipy for dendrogram coordinates rather than
          showcasing more plotnine-specific grammar of graphics features.
  verdict: APPROVED
