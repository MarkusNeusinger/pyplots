review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn lineplot with hue and style parameters for multi-series
    visualization
  - Well-crafted synthetic data showing distinct patterns (growth, seasonal, stable)
    for each product line
  - Clear visual distinction between all 4 series with good color and marker choices
  - Appropriate text sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business context (monthly product sales) that demonstrates the plot
    type effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like sns.set_theme() or custom context
    settings
  - The color palette is custom but not from seaborn recommended colorblind-safe palettes
  image_description: The plot displays a multi-line chart with 4 product lines (Electronics,
    Apparel, Home & Garden, Sports) tracked over 12 months (Jan-Dec). Electronics
    (blue line with circle markers) shows strong upward growth culminating in a holiday
    spike in Nov-Dec, reaching ~133K. Apparel (yellow/gold line with X markers) shows
    a seasonal wave pattern peaking around April-June. Home & Garden (green line with
    square markers) peaks in summer (Aug) then declines. Sports (pink/magenta line
    with + markers) remains relatively stable with slight downward trend. The title
    "line-multi · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. A well-positioned
    legend in the upper left identifies each series. The y-axis shows "Sales (thousands
    USD)" ranging 0-140, x-axis shows month names. All lines have markers at data
    points and use distinct colors.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with hue/style for grouping which is seaborn's
          strength, but could leverage more advanced features like confidence intervals
          or seaborn's built-in themes
  verdict: APPROVED
