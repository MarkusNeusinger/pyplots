review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native drilldown module with proper breadcrumb configuration
  - Well-structured hierarchical data with realistic company revenue breakdown
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between slices
  - Proper data labels showing both absolute values and percentages
  - Interactive HTML version saved alongside PNG for full drilldown functionality
  - Good accessibility configuration with announceNewData and valueSuffix
  weaknesses:
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the core drilldown interactivity (inherent limitation)
  - Legend positioned far right could be closer to the chart for better visual grouping
