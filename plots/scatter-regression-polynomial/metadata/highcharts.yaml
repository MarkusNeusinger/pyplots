review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polynomial regression with R² and equation display
    in subtitle
  - Perfect title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic diminishing returns scenario (advertising spend vs revenue) perfectly
    demonstrates polynomial relationships
  - 'Clean colorblind-safe color palette (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Appropriate marker sizing (radius 12) and transparency (0.65) for 80 data points
  - SplineSeries creates a smooth, visually distinct regression curve
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text styling could be more prominent at current font sizes
  - Could leverage Highcharts-specific features like tooltip formatters or data labels
    for enhanced interactivity
  - Missing optional confidence band mentioned in spec (though marked as optional)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with 80 blue data points (semi-transparent
    with darker blue outlines) showing a quadratic relationship between Advertising
    Spend ($k) on the x-axis (1-20) and Revenue ($k) on the y-axis (~10-100). A smooth
    yellow/gold polynomial regression curve (degree 2) fits through the data, clearly
    demonstrating diminishing returns. The title "scatter-regression-polynomial ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The subtitle displays the
    fitted equation "y = -0.277x² + 9.550x + 5.917 | R² = 0.9563". A legend in the
    top-right corner shows "Data Points" and "Polynomial Fit (R² = 0.956)". The background
    is white with subtle gray grid lines. The layout is well-balanced with good use
    of the canvas space.
