review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly.express px.timeline for Gantt chart creation - the right
    tool for the job
  - Clear visual hierarchy with tasks sorted by start date and y-axis reversed for
    natural top-to-bottom reading
  - Today marker line with annotation provides practical project tracking reference
  - Color-coded categories with custom colorblind-safe palette
  - Clean implementation with proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic software development project scenario with believable task dependencies
    and overlaps
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided, leveraging Plotly interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha=0.1) - increasing to 0.2-0.3 would improve readability
  - No hover customization to show task details in interactive version
