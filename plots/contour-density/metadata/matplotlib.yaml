review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of filled contours with contour lines for visual clarity
  - Appropriate scatter point overlay with semi-transparency showing individual points
  - Good colorbar implementation with proper labeling
  - Two-cluster data effectively demonstrates density pattern detection
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of KDE from scipy for density computation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Variable, Y Variable) - could use descriptive labels
    with units
  - Does not use matplotlib contour label feature (ax.clabel) which would add value
  - Scatter point size (s=30) is on the smaller side for overlay context
