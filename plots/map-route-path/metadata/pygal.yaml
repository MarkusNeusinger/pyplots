review:
  strengths:
  - Good implementation of color-coded time progression segments showing the route
    journey
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Appropriate use of custom Style for font sizes and colors at the target resolution
  - Realistic GPS track data with added noise for authenticity
  - Distinct start and finish markers with contrasting colors (green/magenta)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols (▶ START, ◼ FINISH) do not render in the output - they appear as
    regular colored squares
  - No geographic basemap for spatial context (pygal limitation - XY chart is best
    approximation available)
  - Color palette includes green and cyan adjacent segments that may be difficult
    to distinguish for colorblind users
  - Some empty whitespace in lower-left area due to the loop shape of the route
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Route Path Map visualization showing a hiking
    trail GPS track in Central Park rendered as an XY line chart. The route forms
    an elongated loop shape with coordinates showing Longitude (degrees) on the X-axis
    ranging from approximately -73.986 to -73.956, and Latitude (degrees) on the Y-axis
    ranging from approximately 40.75 to 40.795. The path is divided into 5 color-coded
    segments showing time progression: dark blue (1: Start), cyan (2: Morning), green
    (3: Midday), yellow (4: Afternoon), and red/orange (5: End). A green circular
    marker indicates the START position near the top of the route, and a magenta/red
    circular marker indicates the FINISH position, both located close together at
    approximately (-73.97, 40.795). The legend is positioned at the bottom with all
    series clearly labeled. The title follows the correct format "map-route-path ·
    pygal · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are visible with subtle styling.'

        comment: pygal is fundamentally a charting library, not a mapping library;
          using XY chart for geographic data is a workaround but does not leverage
          distinctive pygal features
