review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with properly scaled fonts (24pt title, 20pt axis titles,
    16pt tick labels)
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper dodge positioning
  - Meaningful data showing different business patterns (growth, seasonal, peaked)
  - Correct title format and professional minimal theme
  - Good use of scale_fill_manual for custom brand colors
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio (1600x900 base, scaled 3x)
  weaknesses:
  - Red color in the palette may not be ideal for red-green colorblind users (consider
    using a more accessible palette like viridis or colorblind-safe)
  - Grid styling removes x-axis grid but leaves y-axis grid subtle - could be more
    balanced
  - Could add value labels on bars for precise comparisons as noted in spec (optional
    but helpful)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    data for three product categories. The chart has a clean white/light gray background
    with a minimal theme. Four quarters (Q1-Q4) are shown on the x-axis, with three
    bars per quarter representing Electronics (blue #306998), Clothing (yellow #FFD43B),
    and Home & Garden (red #DC2626). The y-axis shows "Revenue ($ thousands)" ranging
    from 0 to 240. The title "bar-grouped · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold. A legend labeled "Product Category" is positioned on the right side.
    The bars show clear patterns: Electronics shows consistent growth (145→168→192→235),
    Clothing shows seasonal variation (98→112→87→142), and Home & Garden peaks in
    summer (67→95→108→72). Bar spacing and grouping are well-balanced.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar correctly with geom_bar, position_dodge, scale_fill_manual,
          theme_minimal, and ggsize. Uses lets-plot's HTML export capability. Could
          leverage more interactive features.
  verdict: APPROVED
