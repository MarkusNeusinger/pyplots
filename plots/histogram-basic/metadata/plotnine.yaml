review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing following library guidelines (title 24pt, axis titles 20pt,
    tick labels 16pt)
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation with proper layering
  - Good use of theme_minimal for a clean, professional appearance
  - Appropriate bin count (25) for 500 data points - reveals distribution shape without
    noise
  - White bar borders provide clear visual separation between bins
  - Realistic test score scenario that is immediately understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Test Score (points)" or "Frequency (count)")
  - Data extends beyond 100 which is atypical for test scores on a 0-100 scale
  - Distribution is purely symmetric normal - could show more interesting features
    like slight skewness
