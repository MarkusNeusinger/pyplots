review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts errorbar series with proper whisker styling (caps
    visible)
  - Clear subtitle explaining what error bars represent (±1 SD) as required by spec
  - Professional appearance with colorblind-safe color palette
  - Properly downloads and inlines Highcharts JS for headless rendering
  - Clean separation between bar series and errorbar series
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears to only show Mean Value entry; the Error series legend entry is
    not visible in the rendered image
  - Could demonstrate asymmetric error bars to fully showcase the capability mentioned
    in spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 5 blue columns (#306998)
    representing treatment groups: Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C,
    and Treatment D. Each bar has black error bars with visible caps (whiskers) extending
    above and below the bar tops. The title "bar-error · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Error bars represent ±1 Standard
    Deviation" below it. The y-axis is labeled "Response Value (units)" ranging from
    0 to ~80, and the x-axis is labeled "Treatment Group". A legend showing "Mean
    Value" appears in the top-right corner. The grid uses subtle dashed horizontal
    lines. Treatment C shows the highest value (~68), while Control shows the lowest
    (~42).'

        comment: Grid is subtle with dashed lines (good), but legend is incomplete
          - only shows "Mean Value", the "Error (±1 SD)" entry defined in code is
          not visible in the screenshot
