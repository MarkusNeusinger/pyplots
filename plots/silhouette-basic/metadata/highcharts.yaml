review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of silhouette analysis with clear cluster separation
  - 'Proper implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, cluster grouping,
    average line, and cluster annotations'
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic Iris dataset scenario with 3 clusters showing diverse silhouette characteristics
  - Interactive tooltip configured for hover information
  - Cluster background bands effectively distinguish cluster regions
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis (silhouette coefficient axis) label text not visible in the rendered image
  - Y-axis label font could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full resolution
  - Legend text could be larger for better visibility
