review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the centered baseline algorithm creating proper symmetric
    streamgraph
  - Smooth polynomial interpolation (degree 10) creates flowing, organic curves that
    look professional
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue (#306998), distinct adjacent
    colors
  - Proper use of Bokeh patch method for filled polygon areas
  - Well-sized text elements appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic music streaming data scenario that matches specification perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for the canvas size
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity which is a key Bokeh strength
  - Y-axis label says relative but could benefit from units
