review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color choice
  - Data scenario (website traffic) is realistic and demonstrates the filled line
    concept well
  - Clean KISS code structure following all conventions
  - 'Properly implements all spec requirements: semi-transparent fill, visible line,
    matching colors, y=0 baseline'
  - Weekly cyclical pattern with upward trend makes the visualization interesting
    and informative
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units for full VQ-06 points (e.g., Website Visitors
    (count) or Day (number))
  - Data could show more variety (e.g., a notable spike or dip for a special event)
    to demonstrate range of values better
  - Fill is done with matplotlib fill_between rather than a seaborn-native approach
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart showing website traffic
    over 60 days. The x-axis shows "Day" (0-60) and the y-axis shows "Website Visitors"
    (0-8000+). A blue line (#306998) traces daily visitor counts with a semi-transparent
    blue fill beneath it extending to the y=0 baseline. The data shows an upward trend
    with weekly cyclical patterns (peaks roughly every 7 days). The title reads "line-filled
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left identifies the line as "Daily
    Visitors". The grid is subtle with dashed lines at alpha 0.3.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot which is seaborn's plotting function, but fill_between
          comes from matplotlib. Could have explored seaborn's native area plot capabilities
          more.
  verdict: APPROVED
