review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the drilldown concept using side-by-side panels
  - Clear value labels on all bars with proper formatting ($XXM)
  - Good use of hierarchical data structure with parent-child relationships
  - Breadcrumb navigation concept shown in subplot titles
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines for easier value comparison across bars
  - Static visualization cannot demonstrate actual click-to-drill interactivity (inherent
    limitation for seaborn)
  - Color palette in right panel has two similar blue shades that could be more distinct
  - No explicit random seed (though data is deterministic)
  - Does not show 3rd hierarchy level mentioned in spec (2-3 levels deep)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a side-by-side visualization of hierarchical
    drilldown functionality using two bar charts. The left panel shows "Level 1: All
    Regions" with three bars: North America ($850M, steel blue), Europe ($620M, golden
    yellow), and Asia Pacific ($530M, light blue). The right panel shows "Level 2:
    All > North America" representing the drilled-down view with three country bars:
    USA ($480M, steel blue), Canada ($220M, light blue), and Mexico ($150M, gray).
    Both panels have clear axis labels ("Region"/"Country" on x-axis, "Sales ($ Millions)"
    on y-axis), value labels on top of each bar, and subtitle text indicating navigation
    hints. The main title "bar-drilldown · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the
    top in bold.'
