review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lower-triangle correlation matrix reducing redundancy
  - Well-chosen blue-white-red diverging colormap centered at zero as spec requires
  - Clear cell annotations with good contrast (bold text with white outline)
  - Realistic financial metrics scenario with plausible correlation relationships
  - Proper colorbar range fixed to -1 to 1 for consistent interpretation
  - Custom JavaScript tooltip formatter showing variable pair names
  - Clean KISS code structure following library-specific patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Cell value text could use slightly larger font for better readability at smaller
    display sizes
  - Consider using a more colorblind-friendly diverging palette (blue-white-orange
    instead of blue-white-red)
