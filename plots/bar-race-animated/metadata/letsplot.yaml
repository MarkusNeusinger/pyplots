review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of spec for a static library - small multiples effectively
    show the race over time
  - Clean, professional visual design with consistent entity colors across all panels
  - Realistic streaming platform data that tells a compelling story (CineCloud rise,
    FlixNet stagnation)
  - Good use of lets-plot gggrid for the 2x2 layout
  - Proper sorting within each panel shows ranking changes clearly
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis scale differs across panels (0-140, 0-140, 0-300, 0-700) which can make
    visual comparison harder
  - Could benefit from value labels on bars to show exact subscriber counts
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples grid showing streaming
    platform subscriber counts across 4 time snapshots (2016, 2018, 2021, 2023). Each
    panel contains horizontal bar charts with 6 platforms (FlixNet, ViewHub, StreamMax,
    MediaFlow, WatchNow, CineCloud) sorted by subscriber count within each year. Colors
    are consistent across all panels: FlixNet (red), ViewHub (yellow/gold), StreamMax
    (blue), MediaFlow (orange), WatchNow (green), CineCloud (purple). The overall
    title "bar-race-animated · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. Rankings
    clearly shift over time - FlixNet leads in 2016-2018, but CineCloud surges to
    first place by 2023. X-axis shows "Subscribers (millions)" with scales adjusting
    per panel. The layout is clean with minimal grid styling and no legend (colors
    are self-explanatory via consistent entity coloring).'
