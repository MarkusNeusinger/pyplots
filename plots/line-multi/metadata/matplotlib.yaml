review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data diversity showing three distinct patterns: steady growth, mid-year
    dip/recovery, and exponential growth'
  - Perfect text sizing following matplotlib.md guidelines (title 24pt, labels 20pt,
    ticks 16pt)
  - Appropriate use of distinct line styles (solid, dashed, dash-dot) combined with
    different markers (circle, square, triangle) for triple differentiation
  - Clean KISS code structure with realistic business context
  - Well-balanced layout with legend placement that does not obscure data
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like fill_between for confidence
    intervals, annotations for key data points, or secondary y-axis for percentage
    change
  - Yellow color (#FFD43B) may be slightly difficult to distinguish from white background
    in some viewing conditions
  image_description: The plot displays a multi-line comparison chart showing monthly
    sales data (in thousands of dollars) for three product lines across 12 months
    (January to December). **Product A (Electronics)** is shown as a blue solid line
    with circle markers, demonstrating steady growth with a seasonal Q4 bump, ranging
    from ~52K to ~107K. **Product B (Appliances)** appears as a yellow/gold dashed
    line with square markers, starting high (~81K), dipping mid-year (~55K), then
    recovering (~79K). **Product C (Software)** is rendered as a red dash-dot line
    with triangle markers, showing exponential growth from ~29K to ~70K. The title
    correctly reads "line-multi · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Legend is positioned in
    the upper left with clear series identification. Grid is subtle with dashed lines.
    All text is clearly readable with proper sizing.
