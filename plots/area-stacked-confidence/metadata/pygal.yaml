review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with good reproducibility (seed set)
  - Realistic business scenario with quarterly revenue data
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  - Creative approach to implement confidence bands in pygal's limited API
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence bands don't visually surround the central values as specified - they
    appear as separate stacked layers
  - Legend is confusing with 6 entries instead of clearly explaining 3 series with
    confidence bands
  - Light confidence band colors are barely distinguishable from the central area
    fills
  - The spec calls for bands that surround each series, but the stacked approach places
    bands above/below rather than around
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart titled "area-stacked-confidence
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" showing quarterly revenue forecasts from Q1''24 to Q4''25.
    The Y-axis shows "Revenue ($M)" ranging from 0 to 400+. Three product lines are
    represented: Core (blue), Growth (gold/yellow), and New (red/coral). The chart
    uses a stacked line approach with fill enabled. Each product line has associated
    confidence intervals shown as lighter shaded bands. The legend at the bottom shows
    6 entries: "A: Core (90% CI)", "A: Core", "B: Growth (90% CI)", "B: Growth", "C:
    New (90% CI)", "C: New". The plot has a clean white background with subtle horizontal
    grid lines. Text is legible with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas.'
