review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic hiking trail data with proper GPS coordinates for Central Park
  - Correct title format and good canvas utilization
  - Route path clearly visible as a continuous connected line
  - Proper use of pygal custom Style for consistent branding
  weaknesses:
  - Start and End markers are defined in code but NOT visible in the rendered plot
    - the green Start point and red End point are not appearing despite being added
    to the chart
  - Missing color gradient along path to show time progression as mentioned in spec
  - No direction arrows or indicators showing travel direction
  - Legend claims to show Start/End markers that are invisible in the actual plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a route path map showing a hiking trail loop
    in the Central Park area (New York). The path is rendered as a continuous blue
    line connecting sequential waypoints that form an elongated loop shape. The X-axis
    shows Longitude (ranging from approximately -73.986 to -73.956) and the Y-axis
    shows Latitude (ranging from approximately 40.75 to 40.795). The title "map-route-path
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend is positioned in the
    top-left corner showing three items: "Hiking Trail" (blue), "Start" (green), and
    "End" (red). However, the Start and End markers are NOT visible on the plot -
    only the blue route line is displayed. The grid lines are subtle gray dashed lines.
    The overall layout has balanced proportions with the plot filling most of the
    canvas.'
