review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between historical data and forecast with clear color
    coding
  - Nested confidence bands with appropriate transparency (0.2 for 95%, 0.35 for 80%)
  - Well-implemented increasing uncertainty over forecast horizon using sqrt growth
  - Clean, readable code with proper seaborn styling
  - Smooth connection between historical and forecast data at the transition point
  weaknesses:
  - Fill_between for confidence bands uses matplotlib directly instead of seaborn-native
    approaches
  - Legend includes 4 entries which is slightly busy; could consider grouping
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series forecast visualization with
    monthly sales data from January 2022 to July 2025. The historical period (2022-01
    to late 2024) is shown with a solid blue line depicting actual values ranging
    from ~90 to ~140 units, showing clear seasonal patterns with peaks and troughs.
    A vertical dotted gray line marks the "Forecast Start" point around January 2025.
    Beyond this line, a dashed yellow/gold line shows the forecast prediction, with
    two nested uncertainty bands: a darker gold band for 80% confidence and a lighter
    pale yellow band for 95% confidence. The confidence intervals appropriately widen
    as the forecast horizon extends. The title follows the correct format. The legend
    is positioned in the upper left with white background, and axes are clearly labeled
    ("Date" and "Monthly Sales (units)"). The overall layout uses a white grid background
    typical of seaborn.'
