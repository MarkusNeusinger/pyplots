review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib fill_betweenx for creating characteristic silhouette
    bar shapes
  - Uses real iris dataset as specified, providing meaningful clustering context
  - Clear visual separation between clusters with gaps and distinct colors
  - Proper cluster annotations showing average silhouette scores for each group
  - Well-positioned reference line with legend explaining overall average score
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could be simplified since individual sample indices are not meaningful
  - All silhouette values are positive; showing some negative values would better
    demonstrate full range
