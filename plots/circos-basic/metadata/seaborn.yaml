review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of circos plot structure with outer ring, inner data
    track, and bezier ribbons
  - Good use of the husl color palette for segment differentiation
  - Text label rotation logic correctly prevents upside-down text
  - Realistic global trade flow scenario that demonstrates the visualization well
  - Clean visual design with appropriate gaps between segments
  - Square aspect ratio is well-suited for circular visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is only used for styling (set_theme) and colors (color_palette), not for
    actual plotting - this is essentially a matplotlib implementation with seaborn
    theming
  - Contains a function definition (bezier_ribbon) which violates the KISS structure
    requirement
  - No legend explaining what segment sizes or ribbon widths represent
  - Font sizes could be larger for better legibility at target resolution
