review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of fill_between() with proper alpha for semi-transparent fill effect
  - Clean seasonal pattern in data demonstrates the magnitude emphasis purpose well
  - Perfect title format and text sizing following library guidelines exactly
  - Y-axis correctly starts at 0 for proper fill visualization
  - Good color choice (#306998) matching pyplots branding
  - Code follows KISS principle perfectly with clear data generation logic
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use "Month of Year" or "Website Visitors (thousands)")
  - Could add markers at data points to show exact monthly values
  - Library features score limited - could explore gradient fills or secondary styling
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart showing "Website Visitors"
    (y-axis) over 12 months from January to December (x-axis). The fill and line are
    both in a blue color (#306998) with the fill being semi-transparent (alpha ~0.4).
    The line peaks around July (~68,000 visitors) with a clear seasonal pattern -
    lower in winter months (~35,000-40,000) and higher in summer months (~62,000-68,000).
    The title "line-filled · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Grid lines
    are dashed with low alpha. The y-axis starts at 0 and goes to 70,000, and all
    month abbreviations are clearly visible on the x-axis.
