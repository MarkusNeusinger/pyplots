review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stem plot implementation using geom_segment + geom_point + geom_hline
    combination
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good choice of damped oscillation data that demonstrates the discrete nature of
    stem plots
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output with scaled text elements
  - Consistent blue color scheme (#306998) for all stem elements
  weaknesses:
  - Could add units to axis labels (e.g., "Amplitude (a.u.)" for arbitrary units)
  - Does not leverage lets-plot interactive features like tooltips
  image_description: The plot displays a stem plot with 30 data points representing
    a damped oscillation signal. Blue vertical stems (#306998) extend from a black
    horizontal baseline at y=0 to blue circular markers at the top of each stem. The
    x-axis is labeled "Sample Index" (ranging 0-30), and the y-axis is labeled "Amplitude"
    (ranging approximately -0.7 to 1.1). The title "stem-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is positioned at the top-left. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with light
    gray dashed grid lines. The data clearly shows the damped oscillation pattern
    - high amplitude oscillations at the start that progressively decay toward zero
    as the sample index increases.
