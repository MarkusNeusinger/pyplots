review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of circular rotation pattern (u=-y, v=x) as suggested
    in spec
  - Perfect use of viridis colormap to encode vector magnitude, adding meaningful
    insight
  - Well-tuned arrow parameters (scale=25, width=0.008) for clear visibility without
    overlap
  - Correct aspect ratio (set_aspect=equal) for proper vector representation
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though acceptable for dimensionless mathematical coordinates)
  image_description: The plot displays a quiver (vector field) visualization showing
    a circular rotation pattern on a 15×15 grid spanning from -3 to 3 on both axes.
    Arrows represent vectors with direction indicating flow and color encoding magnitude
    via the viridis colormap. Smaller arrows near the center appear in dark purple/blue
    (low magnitude ~0-1), while larger arrows at the periphery are shown in yellow/green
    (high magnitude ~3.5-4.2). The title "quiver-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top. The X and Y axes are labeled "X Position" and "Y Position"
    respectively. A vertical colorbar on the right shows "Vector Magnitude" ranging
    from 0 to ~4.2. A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background.
