review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative workaround for Altair's lack of native polar coordinates by
    converting to Cartesian space
  - Beautiful visual design with well-constructed grid circles and radial lines
  - Compelling data story comparing Northern vs Southern hemisphere temperature patterns
  - Clean, readable code structure with good inline comments
  - Proper use of Altair's layering system to combine grid, labels, and data
  - Color choices provide excellent accessibility and visual contrast
  weaknesses:
  - No radius scale labels showing what the concentric circles represent (temperature
    values)
  image_description: The plot displays a polar line chart showing monthly temperature
    patterns for two cities. A blue line represents "Northern City" and a yellow/gold
    line represents "Southern City". The chart has 12 month labels (Jan-Dec) arranged
    clockwise starting from the right (Jan at ~0°/360°, progressing counterclockwise
    through the months ending at Dec). Four concentric gray circles form the grid
    background, with 12 radial lines extending from the center to each month position.
    Both city lines form closed polygons connecting data points marked with filled
    circles. The Northern City shows peak values around Jul (summer) and low values
    around Jan (winter), while the Southern City shows the opposite pattern - demonstrating
    hemisphere seasonality. The title "polar-line · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top with subtitle "Monthly Temperature Patterns". A legend at the bottom identifies
    the two city series.

        comment: Altair lacks native polar support, so the implementation manually
          converts to Cartesian coordinates. While this is a valid workaround, it
          doesn't showcase Altair's declarative strengths (the chart is essentially
          built manually with mark_line and mark_rule). The layering approach is reasonable
          but not a distinctive Altair feature.
  verdict: APPROVED
