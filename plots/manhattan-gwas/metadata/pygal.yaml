quality_score: 78
review:
  strengths:
  - Good alternating color scheme (blue/gray) for chromosome distinction
  - Proper cumulative genomic position calculation with chromosome midpoints
  - Realistic GWAS data simulation with meaningful significant peaks on chromosomes
    6, 11, and 16
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Interactive tooltips implemented for SVG output
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Threshold lines (genome-wide significance at 7.3 and suggestive at 5.0) are not
    visible in the PNG output despite being added to the chart
  - X-axis shows numeric genomic position labels (0-2900) instead of chromosome numbers
    (1-22) as specified
  - Legend is not visible in the PNG output (may be cut off by margin settings)
  - Y-axis label contains extra metadata that clutters the label
