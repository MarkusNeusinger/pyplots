review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and color mapping system with LinearColorMapper
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of Viridis colormap for accessibility
  - Proper colorbar with title and well-configured label sizes
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low alpha
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than descriptive with units
  - Could add HoverTool for interactive tooltips in HTML output
  - Points could be slightly larger (size=35-40) given the data density
