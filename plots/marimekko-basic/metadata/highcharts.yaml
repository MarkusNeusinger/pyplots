review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts variwide chart type for the Marimekko visualization
  - Clean implementation with proper variable-width bars representing market sizes
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette
  - Data labels on segments improve readability
  - Region names properly centered under each bar using custom renderer
  - Realistic market share data with meaningful variation between regions
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines not visible on the plot area (gridLineWidth set but not appearing prominently)
  - Y-axis tick labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800x2700
