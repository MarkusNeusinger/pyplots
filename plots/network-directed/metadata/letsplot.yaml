review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical layout clearly showing software dependency structure from
    top (App) to bottom (utilities)
  - Clean use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with geom_segment arrows and geom_point
    for nodes
  - Well-chosen color palette distinguishing four module types (application, core,
    infrastructure, utility)
  - Proper edge shortening to prevent arrow overlap with nodes
  - Correct title format and professional styling with theme_void
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate bidirectional edges (curved edges) as mentioned in spec for
    nodes with mutual connections
  - File handling code (os, shutil for moving files from lets-plot-images) adds unnecessary
    complexity
  - HTML export could leverage lets-plot interactive features like tooltips showing
    module details
