review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud (violin) on top, boxplot centered, and rain
    (points) below for horizontal orientation
  - Excellent text legibility with properly sized fonts (title 24pt, axis labels 20pt,
    tick labels 16pt)
  - Good colorblind-friendly palette with distinct blue, yellow, and green colors
  - Realistic reaction time data with meaningful group differences including bimodal
    Treatment B
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seeds
  - Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geoms and position_nudge
  weaknesses:
  - Full violin displayed instead of required half-violin; spec states to clip the
    violin to show only the cloud portion
  - plotnine geom_violin lacks native side/half parameter making true half-violins
    challenging
