review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D-to-2D isometric projection with proper depth sorting (back-to-front
    rendering)
  - Creative use of marker size variation to convey depth perception
  - Professional custom axis system with arrows replacing default axes
  - Viridis colormap provides accessible 4th dimension encoding
  - Clean mathematical approach to projection (elevation=25°, azimuth=45°)
  - Interactive HTML version leverages Bokeh core strength
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels in rendered image show only X, Y, Z instead of full descriptive labels
    with units
  - Color bar title shows Z Value which is redundant with Z-axis; could indicate this
    represents color encoding
