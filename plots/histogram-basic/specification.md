# histogram-basic: Basic Histogram

## Description

A histogram displays the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the data range into bins and showing the frequency (count) of observations in each bin. It reveals the shape of the data distribution, including central tendency, spread, and presence of outliers or multiple modes.

## Applications

- Analyzing exam score distributions to understand student performance patterns
- Exploring measurement data to identify quality control issues in manufacturing
- Understanding customer age demographics for marketing segmentation

## Data

- `values` (numeric) - The continuous variable to visualize
- Size: 50-1000 observations recommended
- Example: Heights, weights, test scores, transaction amounts, or any continuous measurement

## Notes

- Clear bin edges with no gaps between bars
- Readable axis labels showing frequency and value ranges
- Consider appropriate bin count (too few hides patterns, too many creates noise)
- Y-axis should start at zero for accurate visual comparison
