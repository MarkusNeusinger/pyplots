  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - 'Strong data storytelling: trend line with correlation coefficient (r=0.86) and
    highlighted outliers guide the viewer'
  - Idiomatic pygal usage with per-point metadata dicts, stroke_style customization,
    and dual SVG/PNG output
  - Realistic, neutral educational scenario with appropriate data ranges and deliberate
    outliers
  - Professional color palette with custom Style configuration and subtle dashed grid
    lines
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter dot size (9) could be slightly larger for optimal visibility at this data
    density
  - Blue-red color combination may pose minor challenges for some protanopia colorblind
    types
  - Formatter lambdas add code verbosity that could be simplified
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart titled "scatter-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" on a white background with a light gray (#f7f7f7) plot area. Blue
    circular markers (#306998) represent 120 student data points plotting Study Hours
    per Week (hrs) on the x-axis (range 2–14) against Exam Score (%) on the y-axis
    (range 20%–100%). A pink/red dashed trend line (#d64541) runs diagonally from
    lower-left to upper-right, with the legend noting r = 0.86. Two orange markers
    (#e8a838) highlight outliers — a high performer at approximately (3h, 82%) and
    a low performer at approximately (12.5h, 42%). Dashed gray grid lines appear on
    both axes. The legend sits at the bottom with three entries: "Students (n=120)",
    "Trend (r = 0.86)", and "Outliers". All text is clearly readable with explicit
    font sizing. The layout uses the canvas well with balanced margins.'
