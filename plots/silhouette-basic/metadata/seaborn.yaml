review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of silhouette plot with proper sorted bars within each
    cluster
  - Clear visualization with three distinct clusters showing varying cluster quality
  - Good use of Iris dataset as realistic, well-known clustering example
  - Per-cluster average annotations provide valuable insight for cluster comparison
  - Red dashed average line serves as effective reference point
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Professional title formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Per-cluster average annotations use fixed x-position (0.92) instead of being relative
    to data or axes transform - could be cut off with different data ranges
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific plotting functions (primarily uses matplotlib
    barh with seaborn styling)
  - All silhouette scores are positive; demonstrating some negative scores would better
    showcase the plot's ability to identify misclassified samples
