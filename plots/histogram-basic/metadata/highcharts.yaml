review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent histogram representation with no gaps between bars (pointPadding: 0,
    groupPadding: 0)'
  - Clear bell-curve distribution that demonstrates the purpose of a histogram
  - Well-formatted title following the required format
  - Good use of rotated X-axis labels to prevent overlap
  - Proper Y-axis starting at zero for accurate visual comparison
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label "Value Range" could be more descriptive with units (e.g., "Score
    Range" or context-specific label)
  - Data is purely generic normal distribution without a specific real-world context
    in the visualization
  - Could leverage Highcharts tooltips or data labels for enhanced interactivity
