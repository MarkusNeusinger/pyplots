review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Scattermap for geographic visualization with OpenStreetMap
    basemap
  - Color gradient along the path effectively shows progression through the hike
  - Clean, well-organized code with realistic hiking trail data
  - Informative hover tooltips on start/end markers
  - Good visual hierarchy with distinct start (green) and end (red) markers
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes descriptive prefix instead of starting directly with spec-id
  - Could have used Plotly animation to show the hike progressing over time
  - Start/End markers use green/red which may not be fully colorblind-safe
  image_description: 'The plot displays an interactive OpenStreetMap showing a hiking
    trail route in the Swiss Alps region (near Zermatt). The route path is rendered
    with a color gradient transitioning from dark blue/gray at the start to orange/red
    at the end, indicating progression through the hike. A green circular marker labeled
    "Start" appears at the beginning of the route, and a red circular marker labeled
    "End" appears at the terminus. Yellow waypoint markers are placed at regular intervals
    along the path. The legend in the upper-left corner shows three entries: Start
    (green), End (red), and Waypoints (yellow). The title "Alpine Hiking Trail · map-route-path
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles
    showing terrain, roads, and geographic features. The route shows a winding path
    heading generally northeast.'
