review:
  strengths:
  - Clean horizontal bar layout with proper descending sort order (largest at top)
  - Value labels centered on bars with proper currency formatting ($X,XXX)
  - Appropriate use of pygal HorizontalBar chart type for category readability
  - Good color choice (Python blue) with consistent styling
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic business data scenario (product category sales)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent; could use more subtle styling (lower alpha)
  - Font sizes could be increased further for optimal readability at 4800x2700
  - Data values are deterministic but code includes unnecessary explicit sorting of
    already-sorted data
