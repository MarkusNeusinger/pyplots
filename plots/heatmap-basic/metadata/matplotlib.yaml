review:
  strengths:
  - Adaptive text color (white on dark cells, black on light) ensures readability
    across all correlation values
  - TwoSlopeNorm provides proper centering of the diverging colormap at zero, a distinctive
    matplotlib feature
  - Realistic department correlation data with meaningful patterns (e.g., Sales-Marketing
    positive, Dev-Finance negative)
  - All spines removed and colorbar outline hidden for a clean, modern aesthetic
  - White cell edges via pcolormesh edgecolors provide clear cell separation
  weaknesses:
  - Figure dimensions (14x12 at 300dpi = 4200x3600) do not match either standard format
    — should be 16x9 for 4800x2700 or 12x12 for 3600x3600
  - RdBu_r colormap is not optimally colorblind-safe — consider coolwarm or a perceptually-uniform
    diverging alternative
  - Data storytelling could be stronger — no visual emphasis on notable correlations
    beyond colormap encoding
  - The [::-1] data reversal for pcolormesh adds unnecessary complexity; imshow with
    origin parameter could simplify
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 correlation heatmap showing inter-department
    relationships (Sales, Marketing, Support, Dev, HR, Finance, Ops, Legal). A diverging
    RdBu_r colormap is used, centered at zero via TwoSlopeNorm, with deep red for
    strong positive correlations (e.g., Sales-Marketing 0.82) and deep blue for strong
    negative correlations (e.g., Dev-Finance -0.65). Each cell contains a bold numeric
    annotation with adaptive text color — white on dark cells, black on light cells.
    Cells are separated by white edge lines (1.5px). The diagonal displays 1.00 (self-correlation).
    A vertical colorbar on the right is labeled "Correlation Coefficient" spanning
    -1.0 to 1.0. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees for readability. Both axes are
    labeled "Department". The title reads "heatmap-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    in the correct format. All spines are removed for a clean, modern look. The layout
    is near-square with some extra whitespace.
