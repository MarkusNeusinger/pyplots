review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of outlier detection and visualization with distinct
    coloring
  - Clean separation of normal residuals vs outliers using mask
  - Zero reference line implemented with dashed stroke style
  - Demonstrates heteroscedasticity pattern effectively
  - Font sizes appropriately scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart for scatter data
  weaknesses:
  - Missing ±2σ horizontal bands which would enhance diagnostic value
  - Axis labels lack units (generic Fitted Values and Residuals)
  - Legend entry for Zero Reference shows colored square instead of line representation
  - Font sizes in Style deviate from library guide recommendations
