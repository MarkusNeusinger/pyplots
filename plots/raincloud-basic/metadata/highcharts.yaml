review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with all three components (cloud, box, rain) in proper
    above/on/below orientation
  - Excellent data generation showing four distinct distribution types including a
    bimodal Treatment B
  - Good use of Highcharts inverted chart mode to achieve horizontal orientation
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with appropriate transparency
  - All text sizes explicitly set for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: annotations highlighting the bimodal nature of Treatment
    B or the faster Treatment A responses would improve the plot'
  - Y-axis title cramped against left margin; horizontal axis range wider than needed
  - Inline KDE computation is verbose — the for-loop over data points could be more
    concise
  - Standalone HTML output file is unnecessary code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with four experimental
    condition categories (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) on the y-axis
    and Reaction Time (ms) on the x-axis, ranging from approximately 200 to 700ms.
    Each category has three layered elements: a filled half-violin (cloud) extending
    above the category baseline showing distribution shape, a white-filled box plot
    with dark outlines centered on the baseline showing median and quartiles, and
    jittered scatter points (rain) below the baseline showing individual observations.
    Colors are navy blue (Control), golden yellow (Treatment A), purple (Treatment
    B), and cyan (Treatment C). The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle
    dashed horizontal grid lines. Treatment B clearly shows a bimodal distribution
    with two peaks around 350ms and 480ms. The title reads "raincloud-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Reaction Time Distributions Across Experimental
    Conditions." A legend in the top-right corner lists all four categories with their
    color markers. The y-axis label "Experimental Condition" is partially cramped
    against the left edge of the canvas.'
