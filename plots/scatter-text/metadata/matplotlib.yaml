review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario using programming languages positioned by paradigm
    similarity
  - Color encoding by category (Dynamic, Functional, Systems, JVM) adds meaningful
    information
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Title format is correct and professional
  - Legend clearly identifies all four categories
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.9) and bold font weight for visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap in center-left region where Python, F#, Crystal, and Julia
    cluster
  - Could benefit from slightly more spread in coordinates to reduce label proximity
  - Legend uses Patch rectangles rather than showing sample text in each color
  image_description: 'The plot displays 30 programming language names positioned in
    a 2D embedding space, simulating dimensionality reduction output. Each language
    name serves as a text label (no markers/points), colored by category: Dynamic/Scripting
    languages (blue, e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby), Functional languages (golden
    yellow, e.g., Haskell, Clojure, OCaml), Systems languages (teal, e.g., Go, Rust,
    C++), and JVM-based languages (coral, e.g., Java, Kotlin, Scala). The title "scatter-text
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axes are labeled "Embedding Dimension
    1" (x) and "Embedding Dimension 2" (y) with tick marks from 0-8 and 0-7 respectively.
    A legend with colored patches is positioned in the upper right. A subtle dashed
    grid is visible. Some text overlap occurs in the center-left region where Python,
    F#, Crystal, and Julia cluster together.'

        comment: Uses ax.text() appropriately, custom legend with Patch, but could
          leverage more matplotlib features like text rotation or bbox
