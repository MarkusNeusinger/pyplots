review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Clean visual design with white bar edges clearly separating bins
  - Realistic exam score scenario with appropriate statistical parameters (mean=72,
    std=12)
  - Y-axis correctly starts at zero per specification requirements
  - Proper KISS code structure following all guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Could use additional matplotlib-specific features like mean/median lines or histtype
    variations
  - Data distribution is purely normal; could show slight asymmetry or a few outliers
    for richer feature demonstration
