review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of varea glyph for the confidence band, which is idiomatic Bokeh
  - Clean ColumnDataSource usage for data management
  - Widening confidence interval effectively demonstrates prediction uncertainty concept
  - Appropriate font scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Semi-transparent band (alpha 0.3) maintains readability per spec guidelines
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner is cramped and slightly overlaps with plot
    area visually
