AR-06: NOT FEASIBLE
Seaborn is a 2D statistical visualization library built on matplotlib.
It does not have native 3D plotting capabilities.

For 3D contour plots, use:
- matplotlib (with mpl_toolkits.mplot3d)
- plotly
- bokeh (limited 3D support)

Seaborn's strengths are in 2D statistical visualizations:
- Distribution plots (histplot, kdeplot, rugplot)
- Categorical plots (boxplot, violinplot, barplot)
- Regression plots (regplot, lmplot)
- Matrix plots (heatmap, clustermap)
- Relational plots (scatterplot, lineplot)

None of these support 3D coordinate systems.
