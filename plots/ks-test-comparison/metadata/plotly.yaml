review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required K-S test features (ECDFs, max divergence,
    D statistic, p-value) are present and correctly implemented
  - Strong visual design with custom color palette, refined spines, and subtle quartile
    reference lines
  - Shaded divergence region effectively draws attention to the key statistical insight
  - 'Good use of Plotly-distinctive features: interactive hover, HTML export, unified
    hover mode, mode bar tools'
  - Clean, well-structured code with appropriate use of scipy for ECDF and KS test
    computation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or scale context (e.g., Credit Score (0-100))
  - The shaded divergence region spans ±10 credit score points which is visually wider
    than necessary to highlight the maximum distance
  - Step function lines at width 4 are slightly thick for the data density — width
    3 would give a crisper appearance
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step functions comparing "Good Customers" (blue, #306998) and "Bad
    Customers" (orange, #E8590C) credit score distributions on a 0-100 scale. The
    x-axis is labeled "Credit Score" and the y-axis "Cumulative Proportion" ranging
    from 0 to 1. A green dashed vertical line with diamond endpoints marks the point
    of maximum divergence around credit score ~44. A shaded green region highlights
    the divergence zone spanning roughly ±10 points around that maximum. An annotation
    box with a green arrow points to the midpoint of the divergence line, displaying
    "K-S Statistic / D = 0.495 / p < 0.001". Subtle dotted horizontal reference lines
    appear at the 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 cumulative proportion levels. The legend is
    positioned in the upper-left corner with a semi-transparent white background.
    The title "ks-test-comparison · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    overall layout is clean with a white background, minimal spines (bottom and left
    only), and no grid lines.'
