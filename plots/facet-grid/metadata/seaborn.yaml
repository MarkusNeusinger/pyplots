review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn FacetGrid for creating a 3×4 grid layout with row and
    column faceting
  - Clean, realistic business data scenario (marketing spend vs sales revenue)
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for the data density
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Systematic variation in data relationships across regions and quarters
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label repeats on every row when shared axes could display it only once
    on the left edge
  - Could benefit from regression lines (lmplot or regplot) to highlight the varying
    relationships across facets
  image_description: The plot displays a 3×4 grid of scatter plots (12 subplots total).
    Each subplot shows Marketing Spend ($k) on the x-axis (range 5-30) vs Sales Revenue
    ($k) on the y-axis (range ~10-55). The columns are labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 (quarters)
    at the top, and rows are labeled Region A, Region B, Region C on the right side.
    All data points are rendered in a consistent blue color (#306998) with white edge
    borders, slight transparency, and appear well-sized for the data density (25 points
    per cell). The title "facet-grid · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the
    top in bold. Grid lines are subtle dashed lines. The data shows a positive correlation
    between marketing spend and sales revenue, with intercepts increasing across quarters
    and slopes varying by region.

        comment: All text is readable; title, axis labels, and tick labels are appropriately
          sized. Slight deduction as tick labels could be marginally larger for the
          high-resolution output.

        comment: Single blue color scheme is colorblind-safe; no color distinction

        comment: Good layout overall; the grid fills the canvas well, though the right-side
          row labels feel slightly cramped.

        score: 0
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: Grid is subtle with dashed lines and alpha=0.3. No legend needed
          for single-color plot. However, axes are shared but Y-axis labels repeat
          on every row unnecessarily.

        comment: Shows variation across both faceting dimensions (regions have different
          slopes, quarters have different intercepts). Could show more dramatic differences
          between facets.

        comment: Uses seaborn's FacetGrid which is a signature feature, but could
          leverage additional seaborn features like regplot for regression lines or
          color encoding with hue.
