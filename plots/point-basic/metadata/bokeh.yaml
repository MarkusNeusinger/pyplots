review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizontal point estimate plot with proper orientation
    for readability
  - Proper use of Bokeh's Whisker annotation with TeeHead caps for error bars
  - Clean reference line at zero using Span model
  - Appropriate font sizing for the large canvas (36pt title, 28pt labels, 22pt ticks)
  - Good visual hierarchy with yellow-filled points outlined in blue
  - Realistic treatment effect data with varying confidence interval widths
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show exact values on mouse-over (Bokeh's key interactive
    feature)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Effect Size (Cohen's d)" would be more informative)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a horizontal point estimate plot with 6 treatment
    groups (Treatment A through E, plus Control) on the y-axis and Effect Size on
    the x-axis. Each group has a yellow circular point marker with a blue outline
    representing the estimate, connected to horizontal blue error bars (confidence
    intervals) with T-shaped caps at each end. A vertical dashed gray reference line
    is drawn at x=0 (null hypothesis). The title "point-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. Treatment groups show varying effect sizes: Treatment
    A (~2.5), Treatment B (~1.8), Treatment C (~3.2), Treatment D (~-0.5, only one
    crossing zero), Treatment E (~1.2), and Control (at 0). The confidence interval
    widths vary appropriately across groups.'

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick labels are all clearly readable at full
          size. Font sizes are appropriate for the 4800x2700 canvas.

        comment: Point markers are large and clearly visible; error bars have good
          line width and distinct T-caps.

        comment: Blue/yellow color scheme is colorblind-safe; good contrast against
          white background.

        comment: Good use of canvas space; plot is well-centered with balanced margins.
          Minor deduction as there's slightly more whitespace than ideal.

        comment: Grid is subtle with dashed lines and alpha=0.3; no legend needed
          for this plot type.

        passed: false
        comment: Uses Bokeh-specific features like Whisker with TeeHead and Span for
          reference line, but doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive capabilities (HoverTool,
          etc.) which are its main strength.
  verdict: APPROVED
