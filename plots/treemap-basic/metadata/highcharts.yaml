review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data structure with clear parent-child relationships using
    id/parent pattern
  - Colorblind-safe palette with five distinct colors that do not conflict
  - Good use of Highcharts multi-level treemap configuration with different styling
    per level
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that demonstrates treemap utility
  weaknesses:
  - Subcategory labels in smaller rectangles could benefit from slightly larger font
    or overflow handling
  - Tooltip shows values but rectangles themselves do not display the dollar amounts
  - Could add subtle hover effects or animation to showcase Highcharts interactivity
    in HTML version
