review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with the Viridis colormap showing the chirp signal frequency
    sweep distinctly
  - Proper use of dB scale for power representation as recommended in spec
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Interactive hovertemplate provides detailed time/frequency/power information on
    mouseover
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with appropriate units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines (though acceptable for heatmap, subtle grid could help with
    time/frequency reading)
  - Could utilize more Plotly-specific interactive features like range sliders or
    animation controls
