review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected points using color and
    alpha
  - Consistent yellow selection threshold line across all views
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with scale_color_manual and scale_alpha_identity
  - Clean minimal theme applied consistently across panels
  - Appropriate colorblind-safe palette (blue/gray)
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels overlap on the rightmost plot making them unreadable
  - Heavy reliance on PIL for image composition rather than native plotnine multi-panel
    capabilities
  - Plot panels could use more canvas space with less whitespace
  image_description: 'The plot displays three coordinated scatter plot views arranged
    horizontally with a shared title and legend. The main title reads "linked-views-selection
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Selection: x > 4.5 (58/150 points
    selected)". A yellow dashed vertical line at x=4.5 indicates the selection threshold
    across all three panels. Points to the right of this line (selected) are shown
    in blue (#306998) with full opacity, while unselected points appear in gray (#CCCCCC)
    with reduced opacity. The three views show: (1) Scatter (x vs y), (2) X vs Value,
    and (3) Y by Category. A legend at the bottom shows "Selection" with blue for
    "Selected" and gray for "Unselected". The x-axis labels on the rightmost plot
    appear slightly cramped with overlapping numbers.'
