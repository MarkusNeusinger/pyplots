review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct Renko brick calculation algorithm
  - Good visual design with proper title format and annotations
  - Realistic stock price data simulation
  - Appropriate use of color for bullish/bearish distinction
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: No seaborn plotting functions used - only uses sns.set_style() and
    sns.set_context() for styling, all actual plotting done with matplotlib patches'
  - Red-green color scheme is not colorblind accessible - should use colorblind-safe
    alternatives like blue/orange
  - Bricks appear to be directly adjacent rather than having the small gap mentioned
    in spec Notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 40 bricks
    showing price movement over time. Green bricks represent bullish (upward) price
    movements, while red bricks represent bearish (downward) movements. The chart
    shows a realistic price pattern starting around $101, declining to approximately
    $87-88 in the middle section, then recovering to around $110-111 by the end. The
    X-axis shows "Brick Index" (0-40), Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately
    $85-$112. A legend in the upper left identifies "Bullish (Up)" and "Bearish (Down)"
    bricks. The title "renko-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top
    in bold. A "Brick Size: $2" annotation appears in the bottom right corner. The
    chart has a white background with subtle gray grid lines and uses seaborn''s whitegrid
    style.'
