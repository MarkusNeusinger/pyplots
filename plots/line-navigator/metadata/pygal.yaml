review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution combining two pygal charts using PIL to create the navigator
    concept
  - Excellent use of pygal's styling system with custom fonts, colors, and opacity
    settings
  - Good visual distinction between full dataset (blue) and selected range (yellow)
    in navigator
  - Proper cubic interpolation for smooth lines
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  - Realistic 3-year sensor data with trend, seasonality, and noise
  weaknesses:
  - Main chart legend displays "Detail View" instead of the descriptive date range
    label (the code creates detail_label but main_chart shows "#Detail View" - review
    the legend entry)
  - Navigator panel text is too small relative to the overall image size; increase
    nav_style font sizes
  - Missing Y-axis units in labels (e.g., "Sensor Reading (units)" instead of just
    "Sensor Reading")
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart with mini navigator implementation
    using pygal. The main chart (top ~80% of image) shows a blue line graph titled
    "line-navigator · pygal · pyplots.ai" with "Detail View" legend in the upper left.
    The main chart displays sensor readings (Y-axis: 50-90+) over dates from February
    2023 to August 2023 (X-axis labels rotated 45°). The line shows oscillating values
    with peaks around 90 and troughs around 50-55. Below the main chart is a navigator
    panel (~20% height) with gray background titled "Navigator - Full Data Extent"
    showing two overlapping filled area charts: a muted blue "Full Dataset" and a
    yellow/gold "Selected Range" that highlights the portion displayed in the main
    chart. The selected range appears to be the middle portion of the full 3-year
    dataset. Font sizes are readable but the navigator legend text appears small.'
