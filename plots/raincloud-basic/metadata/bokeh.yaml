review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution in Treatment B, showcasing why
    raincloud plots are valuable
  - Proper horizontal orientation as suggested in spec for better label readability
  - Clean separation of the three raincloud components (cloud above, rain below, box
    at center)
  - Realistic reaction time data with appropriate scale and context
  - Good use of Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) as primary colors
  - Proper KDE scaling for half-violin visualization
  weaknesses:
  - No interactive features like HoverTool or tooltips, which are Bokeh signature
    strengths
  - Grid legend indicator in top right corner appears cut off or incomplete
