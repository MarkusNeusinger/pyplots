review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements Y-axis inversion using data transformation (inverted_rankings)
    with custom y_labels mapping
  - Clean, readable code with well-commented transformation logic
  - Good choice of sports league context that naturally fits bump chart use case
  - Excellent color palette with five distinct, accessible colors
  - Proper use of pygal Style for consistent theming at target resolution
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper-left corner slightly overlays the plot area; consider
    using legend_at_bottom=True or adjusting legend_box_size
  - Does not utilize pygal-specific interactive features (tooltips, value formatters,
    hover effects) that would enhance the visualization
