  strengths:
  - Correct use of pygal.Histogram with manually computed bins using numpy histogram
  - Excellent custom Style configuration with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Clean KISS code structure following pyplots conventions
  - Realistic exam score data with meaningful axis labels including units
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern
  - Both HTML and PNG outputs generated as expected for pygal
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (currently dotted lines are visible but acceptable)
  - Does not customize pygal tooltips which is a distinctive feature
  - Histogram bars lack visible borders which would help distinguish adjacent bins
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of exam scores using pygal. The
    chart has a white background with the title "histogram-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    centered at the top in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)"
    ranging from approximately 25 to 100, and the Y-axis is labeled "Number of Students"
    ranging from 0 to about 57. The histogram bars are rendered in a muted blue color
    (#306998) with clear edges and no gaps between adjacent bins. The distribution
    appears roughly normal/bell-shaped, centered around 72-75 points, with a peak
    frequency of approximately 57 students. There are subtle horizontal dotted grid
    lines for the Y-axis. The histogram shows the characteristic shape of exam score
    data - low frequencies at the extremes (very low scores around 25-35 and high
    scores near 100), with the bulk of students scoring in the 60-85 range.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are all clearly readable. Font
          sizes are well-scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas, though tick labels could
          be slightly larger.

        comment: Grid lines are subtle (dotted), but legend is hidden which is appropriate
          for single-series histogram. However, no legend shown for the "Distribution"
          series - acceptable but -2 for the series add without visible legend benefit.

        comment: Shows normal distribution shape well. Distribution is unimodal; could
          show more variation (e.g., slight skew or outlier visibility is present
          at edges) but the clipping at 0-100 creates interesting tail behavior.

        comment: Uses pygal.Histogram with proper (count, start, end) tuple format.
          Uses custom Style for theming. Generates both SVG-based HTML and PNG. Does
          not leverage pygal's built-in interactivity features (tooltips are default
          but not customized).
  verdict: APPROVED
