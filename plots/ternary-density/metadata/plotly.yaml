review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary density using Scatterternary with KDE-colored
    markers
  - Proper Viridis colormap as specified for perceptually uniform density visualization
  - Grid lines visible beneath density layer as required
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing Sand/Silt/Clay percentages
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Contour lines at percentile levels (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th) enhance interpretation
  - Realistic sediment composition context with distinct clusters
  weaknesses:
  - Contour lines (white with alpha 0.6) could be more prominent for easier density
    level interpretation
  - Grid at alpha 0.15 is quite subtle; alpha 0.25-0.3 might improve readability
  - Silt-dominant and mixed clusters are less visually distinct than the sand-dominant
    cluster
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density visualization for sediment
    composition with three vertices labeled Sand (%), Silt (%), and Clay (%). The
    density is rendered using small circular markers colored according to the Viridis
    colormap, ranging from dark purple (low density ~0) to yellow (high density ~6).
    The triangular plot shows multiple density hotspots: a prominent high-density
    region (yellow) near the Sand vertex indicating sand-dominant samples, and additional
    concentration areas visible in teal/green colors in the mid-regions. White contour
    lines overlay the density field at key percentile levels. Grid lines at 20% intervals
    are visible beneath the density layer. A vertical colorbar on the right shows
    the density scale. The title follows the correct format with the spec-id, library,
    and pyplots.ai branding.'
