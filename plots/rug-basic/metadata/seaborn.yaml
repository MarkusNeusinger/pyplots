review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing bimodal distribution with clear clustering patterns,
    gaps, and outliers
  - Clean, minimalist presentation appropriate for rug plots with hidden y-axis
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good use of alpha transparency and line width for visibility in dense regions
  - Realistic response time scenario that demonstrates practical rug plot applications
  weaknesses:
  - Could complement the rug plot with a KDE or histogram overlay to better demonstrate
    spec note that rug plots work best as a complement to other plots
