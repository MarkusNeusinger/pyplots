review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    clearly distinguishable
  - Beautiful color palette with Python Blue and accessible complementary colors
  - Professional typography with well-sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic weather station temperature scenario with seasonal patterns
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure following Altair best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only color swatches, not the actual line styles (Altair limitation
    - strokeDash legend combined with color shows color only)
  - No interactive features (tooltips, hover) which are Altair distinctive strength
