review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with positive changes, negative change (Finance -6), and
    no change (Customer Support) demonstrating full dumbbell chart capability
  - Proper horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as spec recommends
  - Smart sorting by improvement magnitude to reveal patterns
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (blue and yellow)
  - Clean, readable labels with units on x-axis
  - Descriptive legend labels (Before Policy Change, After Policy Change)
  weaknesses:
  - Connecting lines between before/after dots are not visible in the rendered PNG
    - this is the defining feature of a dumbbell chart and its absence significantly
    impacts the visualization
  - Grid lines are too prominent and not subtle (should use alpha 0.2-0.4)
  - Legend markers appear as small squares rather than circular dots matching the
    data points
