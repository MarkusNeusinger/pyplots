review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of individual series per company to achieve distinct colors for
    each data point
  - Clean annotation placement with company names displayed directly on the chart
    using print_values and formatter
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent theming with appropriate font sizes
  - Well-chosen business context (tech companies market cap vs revenue) that is realistic
    and neutral
  - Proper canvas size (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is redundant with on-chart annotations and appears very small/hard
    to read
  - Some color pairs are similar (two purples, two greens) which could cause confusion
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with 12 tech company data points
    plotted on a white background. The X-axis shows "Market Cap (Billion $)" ranging
    from 0 to 160, and the Y-axis shows "Annual Revenue (Billion $)" ranging from
    0 to ~65. Each company is represented by a distinctly colored dot with its name
    annotated directly next to the point. Companies include TechFlow (blue, bottom-left),
    DataPrime (yellow), ByteLogic (light blue), CyberLink (green), CloudNine (red),
    SoftEdge (orange), DevStack (teal), DigiTech (purple), NetWave (green), AppForge
    (dark gray), CodeSphere (purple), and WebCore (gold, top-right). The title "scatter-annotated
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend at the bottom lists
    all 12 companies in 6 columns. Grid lines are visible in light gray. The annotations
    are clearly readable and well-positioned next to each point.
