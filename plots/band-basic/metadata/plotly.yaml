review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing throughout
  - Correct implementation of the toself fill technique for creating the band
  - Heteroscedastic uncertainty band effectively demonstrates growing confidence intervals
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-balanced layout
  - Proper use of semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.3) allowing visibility of overlapping
    elements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (s)" or "Value (units)")
  - Does not leverage Plotly's distinctive interactive features like custom hover
    templates showing the exact confidence bounds
