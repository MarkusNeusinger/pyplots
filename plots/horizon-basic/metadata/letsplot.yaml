review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizon chart implementation with proper band-folding algorithm that
    correctly separates positive/negative values
  - 'Previous feedback fully addressed: legend is now visible, y-axis label is accurate'
  - Purple-orange diverging palette is colorblind-safe and visually appealing
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario perfectly demonstrates the use case for horizon
    charts
  - Clean faceted layout makes comparing 6 time series easy
  - Proper lets-plot grammar usage with theme customization
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Tick text sizes could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full
    resolution'
  - File handling with shutil adds complexity that other libraries do not require
    (lets-plot limitation)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 6-panel faceted horizon chart showing Server
    CPU Usage Deviation for Servers A through F over a week (Monday to Sunday). Each
    panel uses a purple-orange diverging color scheme: purple shades (+Low, +Medium,
    +High) for positive deviations and orange shades (-Low, -Medium, -High) for negative
    deviations. The color intensity increases with magnitude within each band, creating
    a layered area chart effect. A clear legend labeled "Band Intensity" appears on
    the right side explaining all six band categories. The title "Server CPU Usage
    Deviation · horizon-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at
    the top. X-axis shows days of the week, Y-axis shows "Folded Value (stacked bands)".'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar (aes, geom_area, facet_wrap, scale_fill_manual,
          theme_minimal), though doesn't leverage lets-plot's interactive tooltip
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
