review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinate transformation with proper Cartesian
    mapping
  - Well-designed multi-cluster synthetic data that clearly demonstrates density variation
  - Viridis colormap is perceptually uniform and accessible
  - Clean grid lines with appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4)
  - Professional title format and color scheme (#306998 blue throughout)
  weaknesses:
  - Color bar on right edge appears compressed/cut off with the Density title label
    hard to read
  - The helper function ternary_to_cartesian() could be inlined to follow pure KISS
    style (minor)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density visualization showing sediment
    composition data (Sand, Silt, Clay). The triangle is well-proportioned with vertices
    clearly labeled in blue bold text ("Sand" at bottom-left, "Silt" at bottom-right,
    "Clay" at top). A Viridis colormap heatmap fills the triangle showing density
    distribution with three distinct high-density regions (yellow/bright green): one
    prominent cluster near the Sand vertex (sandy sediments), one near the bottom-right
    area (silty sediments), and one near the top-left area (clayey sediments). Grid
    lines are visible at 10% intervals with percentage labels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%)
    along each edge. The title "Sediment Composition · ternary-density · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in blue text. A color bar labeled "Density" appears on the
    right edge showing the continuous density scale from 1 to 5.'
