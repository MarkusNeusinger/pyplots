review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe Python Blue/Yellow palette for up/down differentiation
  - Proper Highstock OHLC chart type implementation with correct bar structure
  - Realistic 50-day stock data with weekend skipping and proper OHLC relationships
  - Clean title format following specification
  - Well-configured tooltips with all OHLC values formatted nicely
  - Appropriate grid styling with subtle dashed lines
  weaknesses:
  - Bar line width could be slightly thicker for optimal visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Could leverage more Highstock features like zoom controls (though disabled is
    acceptable for static export)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) bar chart showing
    50 trading days of simulated stock price data from June 3rd to August 8th. Each
    trading day is represented by a vertical bar with horizontal tick marks: the vertical
    line shows the high-low range, while left and right ticks indicate opening and
    closing prices respectively. The chart uses a colorblind-safe palette with Python
    Blue (#306998) for down bars (close < open) and Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for up
    bars (close > open). The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging from $141 to $158
    with dollar formatting. The X-axis shows dates formatted as "Mon DD" with labels
    appearing every few days to prevent overlap. Dashed grid lines are visible in
    both directions. The title "ohlc-bar · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The data shows an overall upward trend with the price starting around $150,
    dipping to a low around $142 in early July, then rallying to highs around $157
    by early August.'
