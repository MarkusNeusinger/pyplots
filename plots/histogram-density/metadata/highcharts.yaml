review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with theoretical PDF overlay
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue histogram, yellow PDF curve)
  - 'Title follows correct format: histogram-density · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate scale (centered around 75)
  - Proper use of Highcharts column series for histogram and area spline for PDF
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are slightly dense - could use fewer tick marks for cleaner
    appearance
  - Legend positioned in upper right could potentially overlap with tall bars in some
    datasets
  image_description: The plot displays a density histogram showing test score distribution
    with a theoretical normal PDF overlay. The histogram uses **blue/teal colored
    bars** (#306998) representing empirical density, with approximately 25 bins spanning
    test scores from ~30 to ~126 on the x-axis. A smooth **yellow area spline curve**
    (#FFD43B) overlays the histogram representing the theoretical normal distribution.
    The y-axis shows probability density from 0 to ~0.037. The title "histogram-density
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top, with a subtitle
    "Test Score Distribution with Normal PDF Overlay" below it. A legend in the upper
    right corner identifies "Empirical Density" (blue) and "Normal PDF" (yellow).
    The distribution is clearly bell-shaped, centered around 75-78, demonstrating
    a good fit between the empirical histogram and theoretical PDF.
