review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of letsplot's show_half parameter to create proper split violins
  - Well-designed data with varied distribution shapes showing different improvement
    patterns
  - Inner boxplots provide additional statistical context as recommended in spec
  - Interactive tooltips enhance the HTML version
  - Python-branded color scheme (yellow/blue) is distinctive and colorblind-friendly
  - Proper sizing with ggsize(1600, 900) and scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (alpha=0.15) making it harder to read precise values
  - Y-axis extends to 120 when satisfaction scores are capped at 100, creating unnecessary
    whitespace
