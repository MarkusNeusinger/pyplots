review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Marimekko chart with correctly proportioned variable-width
    bars
  - Clear value labels on larger segments with appropriate threshold (height > 0.12)
  - Colorblind-safe palette using seaborn colorblind palette
  - Realistic market share scenario with meaningful regional and product data
  - Well-formatted title following the exact spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern
  - Clean white edges between segments enhance visual separation
  - Informative x-axis label explaining that width is proportional to revenue
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside the plot area creates unused whitespace on the right;
    consider placing inside upper-right corner if space permits
  - While seaborn styling is used appropriately (set_style, set_context, despine),
    the core chart uses matplotlib patches since seaborn lacks native marimekko support
    - this is acceptable given the library limitation
