review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent slider widget design with clear labels, gradient styling, and prominent
    current value display
  - Clean title format following spec requirements exactly
  - Good data generation with realistic yearly growth trends and seasonal patterns
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe color palette
  - Responsive slider interaction that shows/hides series appropriately
  - Professional-looking chart with appropriate text sizes for the canvas size
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled; would be clearer to show a small legend indicating the currently
    selected year
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (alpha is 0.12 which is good, but visual weight
    is noticeable)
  - The line color shown (brownish-red) differs from the blue (#306998) assigned to
    2023 - appears series colors are not rendering as expected
