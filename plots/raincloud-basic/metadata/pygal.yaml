review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of raincloud plot using pygal XY chart primitives
  - Clean KDE computation using Silverman rule for bandwidth estimation
  - Correct vertical raincloud layout with cloud on right, rain on left as per spec
  - Well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe color palette
  - Realistic reaction time data with appropriate outliers showing distribution differences
  weaknesses:
  - Box plot elements could be slightly thicker/more visible relative to the half-violin
  - No interactive tooltips leveraging pygal SVG interactivity capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a raincloud visualization for three treatment
    groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) showing reaction time data in milliseconds.
    Each group uses a distinct color: blue (#306998) for Control, yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Treatment A, and green (#4CAF50) for Treatment B. For each group, from left
    to right: jittered data points ("rain") appear on the left side, followed by a
    box plot (showing median, quartiles, and whiskers) in the center, and a half-violin
    density plot ("cloud") on the right side. The title "raincloud-basic · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging
    from 100-700, and the X-axis shows "Treatment Group" with the three category labels.
    The layout has subtle grid lines on a white background.'

        comment: Uses pygal's XY chart with custom styling to build a complex visualization.
          While impressive manual construction, it doesn't leverage pygal-specific
          features like built-in interactivity or tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
