review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts-specific features including error bar series overlay
    and dynamic color gradient per bar
  - Clean sequential blue color scheme effectively communicates importance magnitude
  - Proper implementation of horizontal bar chart with sorted features (most important
    at top)
  - Error bars clearly show variability across permutation repetitions
  - Vertical reference line at x=0 effectively distinguishes positive from negative
    importance
  - Good subtitle provides meaningful context about the model being visualized
  - 'Appropriate margin settings (marginLeft: 300) prevent feature name truncation'
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels at bottom appear small/compressed in the PNG - could benefit
    from larger font size
  - Legend is disabled which removes the "Importance" series name context (though
    acceptable for single series)
  image_description: The plot is a horizontal bar chart displaying permutation feature
    importance for a crop yield prediction model. The chart shows 15 features sorted
    by importance (highest at top). Colors use a sequential blue gradient - darker
    blue (#306998) for most important features fading to lighter blue for less important
    ones. The title reads "bar-permutation-importance · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with
    a subtitle "Crop Yield Prediction Model - Feature Importance". The y-axis shows
    "Mean Decrease in Model Score" with tick marks from approximately -0.05 to 0.40.
    The x-axis displays feature names like "Temperature (C)", "Humidity (%)", "Wind
    Speed (m/s)", etc. Error bars (whiskers) are visible on each bar showing importance
    variability. A vertical reference line at x=0 distinguishes positive from negative
    importance values. Two features (Visibility and Air Quality Index) show slightly
    negative importance with error bars crossing zero.
