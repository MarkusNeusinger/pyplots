  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Fourier transformation formula for Andrews curves
  - Perfect use of transparency (alpha=0.4) to reveal curve density and overlap patterns
  - Clear visual separation between Iris species demonstrates the technique utility
  - 'Professional use of Plotly features: legendgroup for grouped legend entries,
    custom hover templates'
  - Proper data normalization prevents any single variable from dominating the curves
  - Clean π notation on x-axis tick labels enhances readability
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) maximizes value for both static and interactive use cases
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function andrews_curve() violating the KISS no functions
    rule; should inline the transformation logic
  - Yellow color for Versicolor may be less distinguishable for colorblind users;
    consider using a more accessible palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays Andrews curves for the Iris dataset with 150
    samples transformed into Fourier series curves. Three species are shown: Setosa
    (blue), Versicolor (yellow/gold), and Virginica (red/coral). The x-axis shows
    parameter t in radians from -π to π with proper π notation tick labels. The y-axis
    shows f(t) in normalized units ranging from approximately -4 to 4. The title correctly
    reads "Iris Dataset · andrews-curves · plotly · pyplots.ai". The legend is well-positioned
    in the upper right corner with a subtle border. Curves show clear visual separation
    between species - Setosa curves (blue) cluster distinctly from Versicolor and
    Virginica, which show some natural overlap. Transparency (alpha=0.4) effectively
    reveals density patterns where curves converge and diverge.'
