review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of chord diagram using Altair mark_line for both
    arcs and chords
  - Clean color palette with good contrast and distinct colors for each continent
  - Proper proportional sizing of both arcs (based on total flow) and chords (based
    on individual flow values)
  - Well-structured code with clear separation of data preparation, arc generation,
    and chord path calculation
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity showing From/To/Flow information
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Chord diagram is not a native Altair chart type, requiring significant manual
    geometry calculations which reduces the declarative advantage of Altair
  - Labels could benefit from slight rotation for better alignment with arc positions
  - Flow values lack units in the data context
