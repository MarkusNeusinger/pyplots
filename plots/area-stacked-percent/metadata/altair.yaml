review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with stack="normalize" for proper
    100% stacking
  - Clear, compelling real-world narrative (energy transition) that perfectly demonstrates
    the spec
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized long-format
    data
  - Good typography sizing making all text highly readable
  - Appropriate use of tooltips and interactive HTML export
  - Proper stacking order using explicit order encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned outside creates slight whitespace imbalance; consider moving
    inside plot area
  - Nuclear data staying perfectly flat at 12% for all 10 years feels artificially
    constant
