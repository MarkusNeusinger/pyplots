review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of arc diagram using Altairs declarative grammar with
    custom path generation
  - Beautiful color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) brand
    colors
  - Arc height correctly proportional to node distance as specified
  - Semi-transparency (0.6) handles overlapping arcs well
  - Edge weight encoding via strokeWidth provides visual differentiation
  - Clean code structure with clear data preparation and chart layering
  - 'Appropriate data context: character interactions in a story chapter'
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has excessive whitespace below the baseline; nodes are positioned at y=10
    in a 900px height canvas
  - Missing legend for edge weight interpretation (strokeWidth encoding has legend=None)
