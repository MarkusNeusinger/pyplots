review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of overfitting visualization with validation loss diverging
    after epoch 60
  - Clean, readable code with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of Plotly hover templates showing epoch and loss values on hover
  - Appropriate color scheme (blue/yellow) with good accessibility
  - Best epoch marker with star symbol effectively highlights the optimal stopping
    point
  - HTML output enabled for full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend background slightly blends with grid lines in upper right area
  - Star marker for best epoch could be larger (size 16 is adequate but not prominent)
  - Could utilize Plotly-specific features like vertical line annotation at best epoch
    or shaded overfitting region
