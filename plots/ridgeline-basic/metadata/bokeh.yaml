  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of manual KDE calculation with Silverman rule for bandwidth
    selection
  - Beautiful color gradient that intuitively maps cold (blue) to warm (yellow/orange)
    temperatures
  - Clean use of Bokeh categorical axis with factor offsets for ridge positioning
  - Proper overlap effect achieved through careful normalization of density curves
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could include y-grid at very low alpha for visual reference
  - The output_file and save calls are somewhat redundant when the primary output
    is PNG via export_png
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ridgeline/joy plot showing monthly temperature
    distributions across all 12 months (January at top to December at bottom). Each
    ridge shows a density curve with the horizontal axis representing Temperature
    (°C) ranging from approximately -5 to 40. The colors transition from deep blue
    (cold months: Jan, Feb, Dec) through cyan/teal (Mar, Apr, Nov), to green (May),
    lime-yellow (Jun), bright yellow (Jul), orange (Aug), and salmon-peach (Sep, Oct).
    The ridges overlap appropriately creating the signature mountain-range appearance.
    The title "ridgeline-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The
    Y-axis shows "Month" label with abbreviated month names as tick labels. The background
    is a light gray (#FAFAFA). Vertical dashed grid lines are visible at regular temperature
    intervals.'

        comment: Y-grid is disabled (alpha=0), X-grid is subtle (dashed, alpha 0.3)
          which is fine, but no legend needed for this plot type
