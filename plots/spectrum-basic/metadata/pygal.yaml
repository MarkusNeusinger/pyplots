review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of frequency spectrum with clear, distinct peaks at 50
    Hz, 120 Hz, and 200 Hz matching the synthetic signal
  - Proper use of dB scale for amplitude representation, making the spectrum analysis
    realistic
  - Well-configured canvas size (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled font sizes for
    readability
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle grid lines and good color contrast
  - Appropriate data preprocessing including FFT computation, normalization, and frequency
    limiting
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with fill for area-under-curve visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing peak annotations or markers to highlight the dominant frequency components
    as suggested in the specification
  - Font sizes in the custom style are quite large (title_font_size=72) which may
    be excessive; could be slightly reduced for better proportions
