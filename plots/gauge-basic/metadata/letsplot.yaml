review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a gauge chart using lets-plot polygon and segment
    geoms
  - Clean, well-structured code with clear comments explaining each section
  - Proper use of grammar of graphics approach to build the gauge from primitives
  - White borders between zones provide good visual separation
  - Value display is prominent and well-positioned
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme uses red/yellow/green which may not be fully accessible to colorblind
    users
  - Could add intermediate tick marks or labels for better readability of values between
    0-100
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart (speedometer style)
    with three distinct color zones: red on the left (0-30 range), yellow in the middle
    (30-70 range), and green on the right (70-100 range). A dark navy/black needle
    points to the value 72, which falls in the green zone. The gauge has a dark circular
    pivot point at the center base. Min value "0" is labeled on the left edge and
    max value "100" on the right edge. The current value "72" is prominently displayed
    in large bold text below the gauge. The title "gauge-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears in the top-left corner.'
