review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bullet chart concept using overlaid horizontal bars
    for qualitative ranges
  - Clean visual hierarchy with grayscale ranges focusing attention on the blue actual-value
    bar
  - Good use of Plotly subplot system to handle multiple metrics with independent
    scales
  - Value annotations provide precise reading as recommended in the spec
  - Target markers are clearly visible thin black lines perpendicular to the bars
  - Multiple KPIs demonstrate the comparison capability mentioned in the spec
  weaknesses:
  - Could use Plotly native go.Indicator with bullet mode for more idiomatic implementation
  - Profit chart shows 140 tick label extending into right margin area
  - Missing explicit x-axis title though subplot titles provide context
