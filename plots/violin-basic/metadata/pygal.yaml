  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of violin plot using pygal XY chart despite no native
    violin support
  - Excellent data quality with 4 distinct distribution shapes including bimodal Advanced
    group
  - Thoughtful colorblind-safe palette with explicit accessibility reasoning (purple
    instead of green)
  - All font sizes explicitly set for clear legibility at target resolution
  - Clean manual KDE using Silverman rule with proper normalization
  - Deliberate wider Advanced violin to emphasize bimodality adds visual storytelling
  weaknesses:
  - Library mastery inherently limited by pygal lack of native violin chart type
  - Monospace font rendering from pygal SVG reduces typographic polish
  - Y-axis range extends below data range creating some unused canvas space
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 violin shapes representing test score distributions
    for class groups: Honors (steel blue), Standard (salmon/orange), Remedial (medium
    purple), and Advanced (gold/yellow). Each violin has a mirrored KDE shape with
    a darker-shaded inner rectangle representing the IQR (interquartile range) and
    a white horizontal median line inside each IQR box. The title "violin-basic ·
    pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in monospace font. The Y-axis reads
    "Test Score (%)" ranging from ~35% to 100% with horizontal grid lines at 10% intervals.
    The X-axis reads "Class Group" with labels beneath each violin. The Honors violin
    is compact and centered around ~88%, Standard is right-skewed peaking around ~72%,
    Remedial is wider and lower centered around ~62%, and Advanced shows a distinctive
    bimodal/wider shape spanning ~50-100% with a deliberately wider violin to highlight
    its two-peak nature. The background is white with subtle light gray horizontal
    grid lines.'
