review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Kagi algorithm implementation with proper reversal threshold logic
  - Good yang/yin state tracking with shoulder/waist calculations
  - Clean separation of data generation, Kagi calculation, and visualization
  - Appropriate use of pygal XY chart with per-segment series for individual styling
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - 'Line thickness not visually distinguishable: Despite setting stroke width to
    10 for yang and 4 for yin, the visual difference is imperceptible. The stroke_style
    width parameter may need significantly larger values (e.g., 20 vs 5) or an alternative
    approach to make the thick/thin distinction visible'
  - Some wasted space on the right side of the chart where xrange extends beyond the
    last data point
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kagi chart showing stock price movements
    over approximately 18 Kagi line segments. The chart uses a white background with
    a clean layout. Price movements are shown using vertical and horizontal line segments
    with different colors: green (yang/bullish) segments appear on the right side
    of the chart (indices 12-18) representing upward price trends reaching highs around
    $125, while red/pink (yin/bearish) segments appear on the left side (indices 0-11)
    representing downward movements with prices dipping to around $85-90. The title
    "kagi-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The Y-axis shows "Price
    ($)" ranging from approximately 85 to 125, and the X-axis shows "Kagi Line Index"
    from 0 to 20. Horizontal Y-axis grid lines are visible. The lines appear thin
    throughout - the key Kagi feature of varying line thickness (thick for yang, thin
    for yin) is not visually apparent despite being coded.'
