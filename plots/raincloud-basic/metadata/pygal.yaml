review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of raincloud plot components using pygal XY chart as
    creative workaround
  - Clean KDE calculation using Silverman rule for bandwidth selection
  - Proper half-violin shape construction with correct closure points
  - Good use of colorblind-friendly palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - Realistic reaction time data with appropriate variation and outliers across groups
  - Box plot components (median, quartiles, whiskers, caps) are all present and properly
    positioned
  weaknesses:
  - Jittered points render as black dots instead of matching their respective group
    colors, reducing visual cohesion
  - Legend appears at bottom despite show_legend=False setting, creating redundancy
    with x-axis labels
  - Box plot stroke visibility could be improved - lines appear thin relative to the
    canvas size
