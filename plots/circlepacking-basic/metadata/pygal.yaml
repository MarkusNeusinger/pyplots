review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using pygal SVG capabilities to implement circle packing which
    is not a native chart type
  - Excellent color scheme using Python-themed blue/yellow palette that is colorblind-safe
  - Good hierarchical data representation with realistic company structure scenario
  - Area-proportional sizing correctly implemented for value encoding
  - Department labels placed outside circles for clarity
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows dummy pie chart categories instead of meaningful circle packing legend
  - Code complexity is high due to manual SVG construction, reducing maintainability
  - Uses internal pygal.etree API which may not be stable across versions
  - Minor text overlap in Engineering department where multiple team circles are packed
    together
  - Some smaller team value labels are difficult to read
