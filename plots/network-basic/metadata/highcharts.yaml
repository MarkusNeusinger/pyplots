review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with four distinct community colors
  - Node size scaling by degree effectively shows connection importance
  - Clean force-directed layout groups communities naturally
  - Proper use of Highcharts networkgraph module with custom node configuration
  - Cross-community bridges are clearly visible connecting the four groups
  - Legend correctly documents all communities
  weaknesses:
  - Some node labels appear outside nodes (Alice, David, Grace, Frank, Olivia, Noah,
    Sara, Paul) rather than centered inside, creating visual inconsistency
  - Network could be positioned more centrally with legend closer to the visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a network graph visualization of a social
    network with 20 people organized into 4 communities. Nodes are colored by community:
    blue (Community A - Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Eve), yellow/gold (Community B -
    Frank, Grace, Henry, Ivy, Jack), teal/cyan (Community C - Kate, Leo, Mia, Noah,
    Olivia), and purple (Community D - Paul, Quinn, Ryan, Sara, Tom). Gray edges connect
    nodes showing friendship relationships both within and between communities. Node
    sizes vary based on degree (connection count), with more connected nodes appearing
    larger. The title "network-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    A legend on the right identifies the four communities. Some node labels appear
    inside nodes while others (Alice, David, Grace, Frank, Olivia, Noah, Sara, Paul)
    appear outside near their nodes.'
