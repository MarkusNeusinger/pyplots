review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative selection and binding system for the slider
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal sales patterns
  - Good visual design with appropriate font sizes and color choice
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis scale starts at 0 but data ranges from 140-190 creating unused space at
    bottom
  - Current slider value not prominently displayed near the slider as spec suggests
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart showing monthly sales data across
    12 months (Jan-Dec). The bars are colored in a pleasant blue (#306998) with slight
    transparency. The Y-axis shows "Sales (thousands $)" ranging from 0 to 200, while
    the X-axis displays month abbreviations. The title "slider-control-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top with a helpful subtitle "Use
    the Year slider to filter monthly sales data". The data shows a clear seasonal
    pattern with peaks in March (~190) and June (~186), and troughs in September (~144).
    The static PNG captures year 2023 data (the slider''s default value). Note: The
    slider widget is not visible in the static PNG but would be present in the interactive
    HTML output.'

        comment: Good use of selection_point with binding_range for interactivity,
          tooltips, and declarative encoding. Could use additional Altair features
          like text labels or conditional formatting.
  verdict: APPROVED
