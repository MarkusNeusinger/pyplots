review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with proper layering
  - Clean data transformation using pandas melt for long-format plotting
  - Good color scheme with Python Blue (#306998) for close price
  - Proper scaling (scale=3) for 4800x2700 output
  - HTML export included for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines on Y-axis not visible as spec requires
  - Title uses letsplot instead of lets-plot (minor)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Simple Moving Average (SMA) chart with time series data spanning approximately January 2024 to March 2025. The chart shows four lines:
    - Close price (blue, #306998) - the main price line with high volatility, showing fluctuations between ~85 and ~114 USD
    - SMA 20 (yellow, #FFD43B) - 20-period moving average, closely tracking price movements
    - SMA 50 (green, #22C55E) - 50-period moving average, showing a smoother trend starting around March
    - SMA 200 (red, #DC2626) - 200-period moving average, appearing only after ~October as a very smooth line

    The title "indicator-sma · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. X-axis shows dates labeled by month (Jan-Mar), Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging from 84-114. A legend titled "Series" is positioned on the right side with colored lines for each series. The plot uses a minimal theme with clean white background and subtle grid lines.
