  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with Distribution Summary box showing mean, median,
    IQR, peak bin, and skew interpretation
  - Professional visual design with custom Style, dashed grid, semi-transparent annotation
    box, and refined typography hierarchy
  - Proper use of pygal native Histogram chart type with (count, low, high) tuple
    format
  - Dual output (PNG + interactive HTML) leverages pygal strength as an SVG/web-oriented
    library
  - 'Well-chosen data: beta distribution creates a realistic left-skewed exam score
    distribution'
  - Clean code structure with thorough statistical annotations that guide the viewer
    understanding
  weaknesses:
  - The mean annotation label near the x-axis is slightly small and faint compared
    to other annotations, reducing its visibility
  - The data_to_px() helper function is a minor KISS violation, though justified by
    PIL annotation requirements
  - PIL-based annotations add code complexity that would not be needed if pygal had
    better native annotation support
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of exam score distributions using
    blue bars (#306998, Python Blue) on a light gray (#fafafa) plot background with
    a white canvas. The title "histogram-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)" with tick
    marks at 60, 70, 80, 90, and the Y-axis is labeled "Number of Students" with ticks
    at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40. The distribution is clearly left-skewed, with most scores
    concentrated in the 75-90 range and a long left tail extending to around 50. A
    translucent white "Distribution Summary" box in the upper-left shows Mean: 77.6,
    Median: 78.8, IQR: 72-85, Peak bin: 78-80 (49 students), and skew direction. A
    red dashed vertical line marks the mean at 77.6, with a small red "Mean (77.6)"
    label near the x-axis. A blue "Peak: 78-80 pts" callout appears above the tallest
    bar. The legend at the bottom reads "Score Distribution (n=500)". Bars are contiguous
    with no gaps, Y-axis starts at zero, and the overall layout is well-balanced with
    the chart filling most of the canvas.'
