review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Circos visualization using only basic Plotly primitives
    (Scatter with fill)
  - Creative use of Bezier curves for ribbon connections through the center
  - Includes both outer ring segments and inner track for additional data layer (GDP
    index)
  - Good color palette with 8 distinct colors for regions
  - Proper proportional sizing of segments based on economic importance
  - Interactive HTML output included alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" not "Regional Trade
    Flows · circos-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
  - Some segment labels appear slightly cramped due to text rotation (especially Middle
    East, South America)
  - Ribbon colors only use source segment color; could blend source/target colors
    for better visual connection indication
