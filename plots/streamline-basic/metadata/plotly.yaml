review:
  strengths:
  - Clean vortex flow pattern clearly demonstrates streamline visualization
  - Good use of plotly figure_factory for streamline generation
  - Appropriate density parameter (1.5) creates balanced streamline distribution
  - Correct title format and good font sizing throughout
  - Interactive HTML output leverages plotly strength
  - Equal aspect ratio (scaleanchor) preserves circular pattern correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar appears in rendered output despite multiple attempts to hide it in code
    - creates visual clutter and misleading Velocity Magnitude label for uniform-colored
    streamlines
  - Layout asymmetry due to unwanted colorbar taking space on right side
