review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data representation with clear parent-child relationships
  - Consistent color scheme within branches (Engineering teams in blue variations,
    Sales teams in yellow variations)
  - Realistic company budget scenario with meaningful department/team structure
  - Proper use of branchvalues=total for accurate proportional representation
  - Custom hover template provides useful budget information
  - Clean white line separators between segments enhance readability
  - Radial text orientation improves label placement
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring segments (HR, Brand) have relatively similar sizes, reducing visual
    variation
  - Chart could be slightly larger to better utilize canvas space for maximum visual
    impact
  image_description: 'The sunburst chart displays a company budget breakdown with
    three hierarchical levels rendered as concentric rings. The innermost circle shows
    "Company Budget" in dark Python Blue (#306998). The second ring displays four
    departments: Engineering (Python Blue), Sales (Python Yellow #FFD43B), Marketing
    (Light Blue), and Operations (Light Yellow). The outermost ring shows teams within
    each department: Backend, Frontend, DevOps under Engineering; Enterprise, SMB
    under Sales; Digital, Brand under Marketing; and HR, Finance under Operations.
    Labels are displayed radially within each segment. The chart uses white line separators
    between segments, with the title "sunburst-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered
    at the top. The overall layout is well-balanced with the chart centered on a white
    background.'
