review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including normal distribution
    overlay and tail highlighting
  - Clean use of Altair declarative syntax with proper layering of histogram, curve,
    and annotations
  - Statistics text box is well-positioned and clearly displays all required metrics
    (mean, std dev, skewness, kurtosis)
  - Appropriate use of t-distribution (df=5) to generate realistic fat-tailed returns
  - Proper density normalization allows meaningful comparison between histogram and
    normal curve
  weaknesses:
  - The extreme right outlier (~21%) causes the x-axis to stretch significantly, compressing
    the main distribution visually
  - Left tail highlighting is less visible due to fewer extreme negative returns in
    the generated data
  - The normal curve dashed pattern could be more prominent for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of financial returns with percentage
    returns on the x-axis (ranging from -6% to 24%) and density on the y-axis (0 to
    0.30). The main distribution bars are rendered in Python blue (#306998) with 80%
    opacity. Tail regions beyond 2 standard deviations are highlighted in red/coral
    (#E74C3C) - visible on the right side around 5-7% returns and one notable outlier
    bar around 21%. A yellow dashed normal distribution curve (#FFD43B) overlays the
    histogram for comparison, clearly showing how the actual distribution has fatter
    tails than normal. A statistics text box in the upper right displays: Mean: 0.07%,
    Std Dev: 2.23%, Skewness: 3.90, Kurtosis: 35.85. The title follows the required
    format "histogram-returns-distribution · altair · pyplots.ai". The layout is clean
    with subtle gridlines and properly sized axis labels.'
