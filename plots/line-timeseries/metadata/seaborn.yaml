review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing and readability at high resolution
  - Smart date formatting with MonthLocator and DateFormatter adapts to the 3-month
    scale
  - Clean KISS code structure following all guidelines
  - Realistic temperature data with appropriate seasonal variation and noise
  - Proper use of seaborn DataFrame-based API
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear on both axes but could show minor grid as well
  - Could leverage seaborn distinctive features like confidence intervals or multiple
    series aggregation
  image_description: The plot shows a time series line chart displaying temperature
    data (in °C) over a 3-month period from January 2024 to April 2024. The line is
    rendered in a blue color (#306998) with a linewidth of 3. The x-axis shows monthly
    date labels ("Jan 2024", "Feb 2024", "Mar 2024", "Apr 2024") rotated at 45 degrees
    for readability. The y-axis displays "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately
    2.5 to 20°C. The title correctly follows the format "line-timeseries · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". A subtle gray dashed grid is present on both axes. The data shows
    realistic temperature variation with noise and a subtle upward seasonal trend.
