review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of funnel concept using centered rectangles with
    proportional widths
  - Clear labeling with stage names, absolute values, and percentages on each segment
  - Pleasing blue gradient color scheme that progresses naturally from dark to light
  - Clean removal of axes, grid, and legend for a polished funnel appearance
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - The sys.path manipulation workaround for import conflicts is not ideal (though
    necessary given file naming constraints)
  - Uses rectangular bars rather than true trapezoids, so it is technically a bar
    funnel rather than a classic funnel shape
