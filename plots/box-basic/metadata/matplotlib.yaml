review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with deliberately varied distributions and injected outliers
    showing all box plot features
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle with good comments
  - Proper font sizing and visual proportions for the output resolution
  - Cohesive color palette with alpha-blending and consistent styling of all box elements
  - Correct use of modern matplotlib API (tick_labels, patch_artist, axes methods)
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: annotations or callouts highlighting key insights (e.g.
    Marketing tightest distribution, Sales widest spread with low outliers) would
    elevate the plot significantly'
  - Library mastery is generic — the implementation does not leverage any distinctive
    matplotlib features beyond the standard boxplot API
  - Color palette could be improved for maximum colorblind safety — the amber/yellow
    pair is close in the warm spectrum
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 vertical box-and-whisker plots arranged
    side by side, one per department: Engineering (steel blue), Marketing (golden
    yellow), Sales (amber/orange), Support (purple), and Design (teal). Each box shows
    the interquartile range with a dark median line and a white diamond mean marker.
    Whiskers extend from the boxes, and gray circle outliers are visible — Engineering
    has two outliers (one low ~38, one high ~99), Sales has two low outliers (~22,
    ~25) and one high (~100), and Support has one low outlier (~49). The y-axis is
    labeled "Score (0–100)" ranging from ~10 to ~105, and the x-axis is labeled "Department".
    The title reads "box-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in a clean medium-weight
    font. Top and right spines are removed, a subtle y-axis grid is present. Distributions
    vary meaningfully: Marketing is tight and high-scoring, Sales is wide and lower,
    Engineering and Design show moderate spread. The overall layout is clean with
    good proportions, and colors are distinct and colorblind-friendly.'
