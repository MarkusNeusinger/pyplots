  image_description: 'The plot shows a horizontal dumbbell chart displaying employee
    satisfaction scores before and after workplace policy changes across 8 departments.
    Each row represents a department (Sales, Finance, Product, Marketing, Operations,
    Engineering, Customer Support, HR) with the y-axis showing "Department" and x-axis
    showing "Satisfaction Score" ranging from 30 to 100. Two colored dots are connected
    by a thin gray line for each department: blue dots (labeled "Before") on the left
    and yellow dots (labeled "After") on the right. The data is sorted by the magnitude
    of change, with HR showing the largest improvement at the bottom. The title follows
    the correct format "dumbbell-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The legend is positioned
    in the lower right corner. All dots are clearly visible with white edge colors,
    and the grid lines are subtle vertical dashed lines.'
  verdict: APPROVED
