review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features including hover templates showing
    node degree
  - Clean three-axis hive plot layout with proper radial positioning
  - Good colorblind-accessible color scheme (blue, yellow, teal)
  - Realistic software dependency network scenario with meaningful node attributes
  - Proper use of bezier curves for edge routing through center
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Node size encoding by degree provides additional visual information
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains function definitions (get_node_position, bezier_curve) violating
    KISS structure requirement
  - Some label overlap near center where high-degree nodes converge
  - Plot uses only about 40-50% of canvas area; could be scaled larger
  - Bottom annotation text is somewhat disconnected from the main visualization
