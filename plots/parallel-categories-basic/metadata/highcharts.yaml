review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data visualization showing clear passenger flow through all four Titanic
    categories
  - Good use of colorblind-friendly palette for most categories with semantic color
    choices
  - Proper use of Highcharts Sankey module with column positioning to create parallel
    categories effect
  - Clean node labeling with display name mapping for readability
  - Helpful dimension labels at the bottom to orient viewers
  - Accessibility features enabled with descriptive text
  - Interactive hover states enhance usability
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green color combination for Survived/Died may be difficult for colorblind
    users; consider using blue/orange instead
  - The code complexity for node naming (suffixes like _M1, _AM1) could be simplified
