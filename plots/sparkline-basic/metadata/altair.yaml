review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent minimalist sparkline design with no axes or labels as specified
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition (line + endpoint markers + highlight
    points)
  - Realistic business data scenario with weekend dips pattern
  - Appropriate compact aspect ratio (~5:1)
  - Colorblind-safe color choices (blue/yellow/gray)
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas height creates more whitespace than necessary for compact sparkline aesthetic
  - Data trend is monotonically increasing - adding a period of decline would better
    demonstrate sparkline ability to show varied trends
  image_description: 'The plot displays a minimalist sparkline with a blue line (#306998)
    showing an upward trend over 60 data points with realistic fluctuations including
    periodic dips (weekend pattern). The visualization includes: a small gray circle
    marking the first data point, a yellow circle highlighting the minimum value (around
    position 15-20), and a blue circle at the end marking both the last point and
    the maximum value. The title "sparkline-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in a clear font. True to sparkline design, there are no axes, labels,
    gridlines, or other chart chrome. The aspect ratio is approximately 5:1, appropriately
    compact for a sparkline.'
