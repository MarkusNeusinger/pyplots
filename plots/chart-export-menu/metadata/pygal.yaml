review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable line chart with professional styling
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent branding
  - Appropriate data visualization for monthly sales trends
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Dual output (HTML + PNG) provides both interactive and static versions
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: The spec is for Chart with Built-in Export Menu but no export menu/button
    is visible in the rendered chart - the core feature is missing from the visual
    output'
  - The legend is positioned in the top-left corner outside the main plot area, making
    it feel disconnected
  - No visible export button, hamburger menu, or download icon as required by the
    specification
  - The static PNG does not demonstrate the export functionality that pygal SVG can
    provide
  image_description: The plot shows a line chart with three data series (Product A,
    Product B, Product C) displaying monthly sales data over a year (Jan-Dec). Product
    A is represented by a dark blue line, Product B by a yellow/gold line, and Product
    C by a light blue/cyan line. The title reads "chart-export-menu · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    at the top center. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands)" ranging from approximately
    25 to 95. The X-axis shows months (Jan through Dec) with the label "Month" below.
    The legend appears in the top-left corner with colored squares indicating each
    product series. A subtle grid is visible with light gray horizontal and vertical
    lines. The chart shows a seasonal pattern with sales peaking around July-August
    and declining afterward. Notably, there is no visible export menu, hamburger icon,
    or download button in the chart, which is the primary feature required by the
    specification.
