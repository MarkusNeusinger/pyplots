review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual layout with central main pie and surrounding drilldown charts
  - Creative solution to show drilldown concept statically with all levels visible
  - Good use of color consistency (shades within each department breakdown)
  - Rich tooltips with department, budget, and percentage information
  - Clean breadcrumb and instructional text
  - Interactive highlighting via selection parameter
  - Proper title format in subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Does not implement true click-to-drill navigation (shows all levels simultaneously
    instead of one level at a time with click to reveal)
  - Uses helper function violating KISS principle (no functions/classes rule)
  - Minor text truncation on DevOps label in Engineering drilldown
