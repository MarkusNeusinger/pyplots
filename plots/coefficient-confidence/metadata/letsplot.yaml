review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_pointrange for coefficient + CI visualization
  - Clean horizontal layout with coord_flip() for long variable names
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling
  - Appropriate colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/gray)
  - Variables properly sorted by coefficient magnitude
  - Well-constructed significance labeling with ordered categorical
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be improved (panel_grid_major_x is blanked, reducing readability)
  - Could leverage more lets-plot interactive features in HTML export (e.g., tooltips)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a coefficient plot for a housing price prediction
    model with 12 predictor variables arranged vertically on the y-axis in order of
    coefficient magnitude. Each variable shows a point estimate (circle marker) with
    horizontal error bars representing 95% confidence intervals. The x-axis shows
    "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)" ranging from approximately -0.5 to 0.6.
    A vertical dashed gray reference line at zero clearly indicates the null hypothesis
    threshold. Variables are color-coded by statistical significance: Python Blue
    (#306998) for significant coefficients (CI does not cross zero) and gray (#999999)
    for non-significant ones. The title correctly uses the format "coefficient-confidence
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". A well-positioned bottom legend shows "Statistical Significance"
    with entries for "Significant (p < 0.05)" and "Not Significant". The minimal theme
    provides clean presentation with subtle gridlines only on the y-axis.'
