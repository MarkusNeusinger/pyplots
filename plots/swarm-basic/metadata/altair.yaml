review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with four distinct distribution patterns (tight, wide, bimodal,
    outliers) demonstrating swarm plot capabilities
  - Creative implementation of swarm effect using manual jitter calculation with local
    density awareness
  - Good layered composition with mean markers and reference lines
  - Well-configured visual styling with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Realistic employee performance scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure could be simpler; the jitter calculation loop adds complexity beyond
    KISS principles
  - Blue (#306998) and teal (#4B8BBE) colors are quite similar and may cause confusion
    for some viewers
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML when specification should focus on PNG output only
