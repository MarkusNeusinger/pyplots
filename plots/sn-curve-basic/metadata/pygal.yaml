review:
  strengths:
  - Correct S-N curve implementation with all required elements (data points, Basquin
    fit, reference lines)
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with logarithmic scale
  - Custom style properly sized for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriate font sizes
  - Realistic fatigue test data with proper scatter simulation
  - All three material reference values clearly shown (UTS, YS, endurance limit)
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are compressed/overlapping at higher cycle counts (pygal logarithmic
    label formatting issue)
  - Legend order could be more intuitive (data then fit then reference lines)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) for steel fatigue
    testing with orange/red circular data points scattered across multiple stress
    levels (450 MPa down to ~195 MPa). A blue dashed line represents the Basquin power-law
    fit descending from upper-left to lower-right. Three horizontal reference lines
    are shown: red at 520 MPa (Ultimate Strength), green at 350 MPa (Yield Strength),
    and purple at 190 MPa (Endurance Limit). The X-axis shows "Cycles to Failure (N)"
    with a logarithmic scale spanning from ~100 to 10^7 cycles. The Y-axis shows "Stress
    Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from ~150 to 550. The legend at bottom lists all five
    series. The title correctly shows "sn-curve-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
