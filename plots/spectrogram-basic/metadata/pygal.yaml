review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a custom heatmap chart type by extending pygal Graph
    class
  - Uses viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended
    in the spec
  - Proper dB scale conversion for power representation
  - Smooth color interpolation between colormap stops
  - 'Includes all required outputs: PNG, SVG, and HTML'
  - Clean handling of scipy import path collision issue
  - Good signal generation with chirp plus harmonics showing time-frequency characteristics
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a class structure rather than KISS flat script (though necessary for
    extending pygal)
  - Grid opacity at 0.25 with white color may be slightly too visible on the colorful
    background
  image_description: The plot displays a spectrogram showing a chirp signal with frequency
    increasing over time (0-2 seconds on x-axis, 0-2000 Hz on y-axis). The visualization
    uses the viridis colormap (dark purple to bright yellow), with the diagonal bright
    band clearly showing the frequency sweep from ~100 Hz to ~1200 Hz. A secondary
    weaker harmonic trace is visible. The colorbar on the right shows power in dB
    ranging from approximately -99 to -16 dB. The title "spectrogram-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Subtle white grid lines help read values. All
    axis labels include units (Time (s), Frequency (Hz), Power (dB)).
