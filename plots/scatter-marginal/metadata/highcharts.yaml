review:
  strengths:
  - Correct composite layout with main scatter and marginal histograms on top and
    right axes
  - Good axis alignment between scatter plot and marginal distributions
  - Appropriate use of Highcharts multi-chart layout with seamless positioning
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with temperature-humidity correlation
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Right marginal histogram bars are not perfectly aligned with scatter plot y-axis
    - bars appear to start from the wrong edge
  - Scatter markers could use more transparency (currently 0.6) to better reveal density
    patterns in overlapping areas
  - Right histogram y-axis scale label (0-30) is partially cut off at the right edge
