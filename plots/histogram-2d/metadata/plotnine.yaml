review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with geom_bin2d
  - Appropriate bin count (40) provides good resolution for the 5000-point dataset
  - Text sizing follows the library guidelines perfectly (24pt title, 20pt axis, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Correlation pattern in the bivariate normal data is clearly visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than context-specific; could
    use a realistic scenario like Asset Returns vs Index Returns
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha) for a cleaner appearance
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D histogram heatmap showing a bivariate
    normal distribution with positive correlation. The visualization uses rectangular
    bins colored with the viridis colormap, ranging from dark purple (low counts ~10)
    through teal/cyan to bright yellow (high counts ~40+). The highest density appears
    in the center around (0, 0) with an elongated elliptical pattern extending from
    lower-left to upper-right, clearly showing the correlation structure. The title
    reads "histogram-2d · plotnine · pyplots.ai" at the top. X-axis is labeled "X
    Value" ranging from -4 to ~3, Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" ranging from -2 to 4.
    A colorbar legend on the right shows "Count" with scale from ~10 to 40. The background
    uses a minimal theme with subtle grid lines.

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_bin2d + scale_fill_continuous),
          but doesn't leverage advanced features like faceting or statistical transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
