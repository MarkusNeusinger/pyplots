review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of quiver plot using line series with null separators
    in a library without native vector field support
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (cyan → green → yellow → orange) for magnitude
    encoding
  - Clear circular rotation pattern demonstrates the vector field concept effectively
  - Properly sized text elements for high-resolution output
  - Well-structured legend with magnitude categories
  - Good use of arrowheads to show direction
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: The helper function magnitude_to_color violates the KISS structure guideline
    (no functions)'
  - Grid lines configured but not visible in the output - the dashed grid was specified
    but does not appear
  image_description: 'The plot displays a quiver (vector field) visualization showing
    a circular wind flow pattern. The chart has a white background with arrows positioned
    on a 12x12 grid spanning from -4 to 4 on both axes. Arrows are color-coded by
    magnitude: cyan (Low), green (Medium), yellow (High), and orange (Very High).
    The circular counterclockwise rotation pattern is clearly visible - arrows near
    the center are small (cyan/low magnitude) while arrows at the periphery are larger
    (orange/very high magnitude). The title "Circular Wind Flow · quiver-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X and Y axis labels show "Position (grid units)".
    A legend at the bottom displays the four magnitude categories with their corresponding
    colors.'

        comment: Grid lines are visible but dashed style works; legend is well-placed.
          However, the grid is not visible in the final output (missing gridlines
          entirely)

        comment: Good use of Highcharts line series with null separators for discrete
          arrows, proper chart configuration, and legend customization. Creative approach
          to implement quiver plot in a library that does not natively support it.
  verdict: APPROVED
