review:
  strengths:
  - Clear elbow point annotation with arrow makes the key insight immediately visible
  - Excellent color scheme with Python-themed blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
    markers
  - Proper font sizing throughout (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Realistic inertia values showing typical K-means clustering behavior
  - Well-structured KISS code following project guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Uses sns.lineplot which is basic; could leverage seaborn statistical features
    more distinctively
  - Y-axis label could include units in parentheses format even if unitless (e.g.,
    Inertia (WCSS))
  image_description: 'The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering with
    a white grid background. A blue line (color #306998) connects 10 data points from
    k=1 to k=10, each marked with yellow/gold circular markers with blue borders.
    The curve shows the characteristic elbow shape: high inertia (~2800) at k=1, sharp
    decrease through k=2 (~1650), k=3 (~950), reaching the elbow at k=4 (~520), then
    diminishing returns through k=10 (~305). The elbow point at k=4 is annotated with
    bold blue text "Elbow Point (k=4)" and an arrow. The title "elbow-curve · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis labeled "Number of Clusters (k)", Y-axis
    labeled "Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)". Layout is well-balanced with
    proper margins.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot which is basic; seaborn's strength is statistical
          visualizations. Could use sns.regplot or statistical features.
