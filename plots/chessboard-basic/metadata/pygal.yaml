review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using StackedBar to represent the chess board grid
  - Correct chess board coloring (a1 dark, h1 light) following standard conventions
  - Proper use of 1:1 aspect ratio for square proportions
  - Clean, readable code with clear comments explaining the approach
  - Good use of pygal Style for customization
  - Classic cream/brown color scheme with excellent contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines between squares would enhance clarity (optional per spec but would
    improve visual definition)
  - Could benefit from slightly thicker visual separation between squares
  image_description: The plot displays a standard 8x8 chess board rendered using pygal's
    StackedBar chart. The board features alternating cream/tan (#F0D9B5) and brown
    (#B58863) squares in the classic chess pattern. Column labels (a-h) appear at
    the bottom of the board, and row labels (1-8) appear on the left side. The title
    "chessboard-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in dark gray text.
    The coloring is correct with a1 being dark and h1 being light, following standard
    chess conventions. The board maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio (3600x3600 px) and fills
    the canvas well with balanced margins. The white background provides clean contrast
    with the board colors.
