review:
  strengths:
  - Correct ECDF step function implementation with proper horizontal-then-vertical
    step pattern
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt ticks)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output, leveraging Bokeh web capabilities
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that aid percentile reading without being distracting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or more descriptive context (e.g., Measurement Value or
    domain-specific label)
  - Data scenario is generic normal distribution rather than a real-world application
    example
  - Could add hover tooltips to show exact percentile values, which is a key Bokeh
    strength
