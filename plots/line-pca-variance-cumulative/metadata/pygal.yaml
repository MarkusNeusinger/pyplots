quality_score: 84
review:
  strengths:
  - Full spec compliance with all requested features including optional individual
    variance overlay
  - Effective data storytelling through elbow annotation, threshold crossing labels,
    and dual-axis presentation
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between all four series
  - Clean, well-structured code with deterministic data and no unnecessary dependencies
  - Good use of pygal-specific features (secondary axis, per-value formatters, stroke_style
    with dasharray)
  weaknesses:
  - Lower-left quadrant of the chart has significant unused space where individual
    variance values approach zero
  - The 90% and 95% annotation labels are close together and could benefit from more
    vertical separation
  - Annotation text size is small relative to the overall chart dimensions
  - The individual variance secondary line lacks its own y-axis label on the right
    side
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart titled "line-pca-variance-cumulative
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" on a white background with light gray plot area. A blue
    cumulative variance line with circular markers rises from approximately 40% at
    component 1 to ~100% at component 13, showing the classic PCA elbow shape. Two
    horizontal dashed threshold lines are present: a purple dashed line at 90% and
    a teal/green dashed line at 95%. Near component 4, a diamond symbol with "Elbow
    (75%)" annotation marks the elbow point. Near the threshold crossings around components
    7-9, "90% ——→" and "95% ——→" annotation text appears. A secondary descending steel-blue
    line represents the individual variance ratios, dropping from the upper left (~40%)
    to near zero at the right. The x-axis is labeled "Number of Components" (1-13),
    and the y-axis "Cumulative Explained Variance (%)". A bottom legend identifies
    four series: Cumulative Variance, 90% Threshold, 95% Threshold, and Individual
    Variance. The color palette is colorblind-safe (blue, purple, teal, steel blue).'
