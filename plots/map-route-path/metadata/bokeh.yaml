review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh tile providers for geographic basemap (CartoDB Positron)
  - Proper Web Mercator coordinate transformation for compatibility with tile providers
  - Clean ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Interactive tools enabled (pan, wheel_zoom, box_zoom, reset)
  - Distinct start (green circle) and end (red square) markers with white borders
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Route path is very complex with many loops - a more realistic hiking trail would
    be more linear/less self-intersecting
  - Path marker points (size 8) are relatively small for 200 points at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Grid lines visible over the map can be slightly distracting
  image_description: The plot displays a route path map overlaid on a CartoDB Positron
    basemap showing the New York City area (Manhattan and surrounding boroughs visible).
    A winding blue line traces a complex looping path that creates figure-8 patterns
    across the map. The route is marked with small circular points along its length
    that show a subtle color gradient from blue at the start to a darker shade toward
    the end. A large green circle marks the start point and a red square marks the
    end point, both with white borders for visibility. The title "map-route-path ·
    bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the upper left. A legend in the top right shows
    "Start" and "End" labels. Axis labels show "Longitude" and "Latitude" with Web
    Mercator coordinate values. The overall layout effectively utilizes the canvas
    with good geographic context.
