review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.countplot with proper ordering by frequency
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed spines and subtle grid
  - Count labels above bars improve readability
  - Realistic survey data scenario with believable distribution weights
  - Proper font sizing for large canvas output (4800x2700 px target)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive features like hue parameter or palette customization
  - Y-axis label could be more specific (e.g., Response Count or Frequency)
