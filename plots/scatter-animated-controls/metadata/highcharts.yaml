review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style animation with play/pause and timeline
    slider controls
  - Clean, professional visual design with proper colorblind-safe palette
  - Well-structured custom JavaScript for animation logic with smooth transitions
  - Proper use of Highcharts bubble chart with size encoding for population
  - Realistic country development data scenario matching the spec inspiration
  weaknesses:
  - Year displayed in two places (subtitle and control panel) - slightly redundant
  - Right side of chart has unused space (x-axis max 100,000 but data only reaches
    ~80,000)
