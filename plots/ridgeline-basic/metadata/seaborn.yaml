  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with the coolwarm color gradient that intuitively maps
    cold months to blue and warm months to red
  - Perfect implementation of the ridgeline pattern using seaborn FacetGrid with appropriate
    overlap (-0.5 hspace)
  - Highly readable with bold, color-matched month labels positioned cleanly to the
    left
  - Data is realistic and demonstrates clear seasonal temperature patterns in a temperate
    climate
  - White outline on ridges enhances visual separation and readability
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a small helper function (label) which slightly deviates from the KISS
    structure preference
  - Could benefit from slightly more variation in distribution spread between months
    to showcase the full capability of ridgeline plots
  image_description: The plot displays a ridgeline/joy plot showing monthly temperature
    distributions across all 12 months. The layout is vertical with December at the
    top and January at the bottom. The density curves have partial overlap creating
    the characteristic "mountain ridge" appearance. The color scheme uses a coolwarm
    palette - cold months (December, November, January, February) appear in blue shades
    while warm months (June, July, August) appear in red/coral shades. Month names
    are displayed as bold labels on the left side, matching the color of their respective
    ridge. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately -10 to 30.
    The title "ridgeline-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at
    the top. Each ridge has a white outline and the distributions clearly show seasonal
    temperature patterns - winter months centered around 0-5°C and summer months around
    20-25°C.

        comment: No grid (appropriate for this plot type), but no legend; month labels
          serve as legend which is acceptable for ridgeline plots

        comment: Uses FacetGrid effectively for ridgeline construction, kdeplot for
          density estimation, coolwarm palette. However, this is a fairly standard
          seaborn ridgeline pattern rather than showcasing unique features.
  verdict: APPROVED
