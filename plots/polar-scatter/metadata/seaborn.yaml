review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar coordinates with correct theta_zero_location
    (North) and clockwise direction
  - Realistic wind data with distinct prevailing directions for morning (SW) and afternoon
    (NE)
  - Good color choice with blue/yellow palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Clean title format following the required specification
  - Appropriate use of seaborn scatterplot with hue parameter for categorical encoding
  - Well-sized markers and good alpha transparency for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - The radial axis label Wind Speed (m/s) is placed as rotated text at an awkward
    angle and overlaps with some data points
  - Figure size uses 12x12 (square) which is acceptable but the library rules suggest
    16x9 landscape as the standard format
