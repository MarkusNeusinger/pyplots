review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data scenario: programming languages positioned by paradigm characteristics
    is immediately understandable and engaging'
  - Proper use of Plotly text mode with grouped traces for legend organization
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good canvas utilization with well-positioned legend
  - Appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Text overlaps in several areas (Fortran/COBOL, JavaScript/Perl, Kotlin/Dart, Prolog/Clojure)
    reduce readability
  - No hover tooltips to leverage Plotly interactivity strengths
  - Some similar colors between categories (Statistical purple vs Multi-paradigm blue)
    could be more distinct
  image_description: 'The plot displays 30 programming languages positioned on a 2D
    coordinate system with "Level of Abstraction" on the x-axis (0-10) and "Type Safety"
    on the y-axis (0-10). Each language name appears as colored text at its corresponding
    coordinates, with colors indicating the programming paradigm category. The legend
    on the right shows 8 categories: Multi-paradigm (blue), OOP (yellow), Systems
    (red), Functional (green), Statistical (purple), Scientific (light blue), Scripting
    (orange), and Legacy (gray). Languages like Haskell and OCaml appear in the high-abstraction/high-type-safety
    region, while Assembly sits in the low-abstraction/low-type-safety corner. The
    title "scatter-text · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The background
    is clean white with subtle grid lines.'
