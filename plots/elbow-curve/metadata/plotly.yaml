review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent elbow point annotation with arrow, bordered text box, and contrasting
    yellow marker that draws attention
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper use of hovertemplate for interactive exploration with formatted values
  - Good color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and complementary yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Appropriate font sizes throughout ensuring readability at full resolution
  - Correct implementation of monotonically decreasing inertia values
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility is too subtle (alpha 0.1) making it hard to trace values
  - Interactive HTML is generated but not being evaluated; could leverage more Plotly-specific
    interactive features
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering with
    a clean white background. The x-axis shows "Number of Clusters (k)" ranging from
    1 to 12, and the y-axis shows "Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (Inertia)" ranging
    from 0 to about 5000. The main curve is rendered in blue (#306998) with connected
    lines and circular markers at each k value. The curve shows the characteristic
    exponential decay pattern of inertia decreasing as k increases. At k=4, there
    is a yellow/gold highlighted marker indicating the elbow point, with an annotation
    box pointing to it that reads "Elbow Point k = 4" in blue text with a border.
    A legend in the upper right shows "Inertia" (blue line with marker) and "Elbow
    (k=4)" (yellow circle). The title "elbow-curve · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top.

        comment: Does not generate HTML for interactivity. The code includes write_html()
          but this is a standard Plotly feature; hover templates are nice but basic.
          Could use more advanced Plotly features like range sliders, buttons, or
          secondary traces for rate-of-change visualization.
  verdict: APPROVED
