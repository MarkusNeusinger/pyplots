review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of four distinct projection types showing different distortion
    characteristics
  - Tissot indicatrices clearly illustrate how each projection distorts area and shape
  - Clean, professional color scheme with good accessibility
  - Proper use of Cartopy library features including cfeature for land/ocean/borders
  - Follows title format specification correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Subplot creation pattern with remove()/add_subplot() is unnecessarily complex;
    could use projection parameter directly in initial subplots creation
  - Bare except clauses in try/except blocks should specify exceptions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid of world maps showing four different
    cartographic projections: Mercator (top-left), Robinson (top-right), Mollweide
    (bottom-left), and Orthographic (bottom-right). Each map shows land masses in
    a neutral beige/cream color (#E8E4D9) and oceans in light blue (#A8D5E5). Country
    borders are displayed as subtle gray lines. Each projection includes a graticule
    (latitude/longitude grid) shown as dashed gray lines at 30-degree intervals. Red/coral
    Tissot indicatrices (ellipses) are distributed across each map to visualize distortion
    patterns - they appear as circles in the Orthographic view but become progressively
    distorted ellipses in other projections, particularly stretched vertically at
    high latitudes in Mercator. The main title "map-projections · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Each subplot has a bold projection name as its title.'
