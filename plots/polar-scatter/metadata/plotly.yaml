quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent compass-oriented polar layout with North at top (rotation=90, clockwise
    direction)
  - Realistic wind data with clear prevailing direction clusters (NW and SE)
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-friendly (blue/yellow/orange)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-sized markers with white borders improve visibility
  - Both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Clean, readable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis label positioned at center can overlap with dense data points
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area
  - Could add custom hover templates to show exact wind direction and speed values
  - Minor whitespace imbalance on the left side of the canvas
