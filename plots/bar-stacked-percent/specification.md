# bar-stacked-percent: 100% Stacked Bar Chart

## Description

A 100% stacked bar chart displays multiple data series as proportional segments within each bar, where every bar is normalized to sum to 100%. This visualization emphasizes composition and relative proportions rather than absolute values, making it ideal for comparing how different components contribute to a whole across categories. It reveals patterns in distribution and share that might be obscured when absolute values vary significantly between categories.

## Applications

- Tracking market share evolution over time where each bar represents a time period and segments show competitor proportions
- Analyzing survey response distributions where each question's responses are shown as percentage breakdowns
- Comparing budget or resource allocation across departments where each bar shows proportional spending by category

## Data

- `category` (categorical) - Labels for each bar on the x-axis (e.g., years, regions, departments)
- `component` (categorical) - The different series being compared (creates the proportional segments)
- `value` (numeric) - Raw values that will be normalized to percentages within each category
- Size: 3-12 categories with 2-6 components recommended for clear interpretation
- Example: Market share by quarter, survey responses by question, energy mix by country

## Notes

- Use distinct, harmonious colors for each component with a clear legend
- Consider adding percentage labels within segments when space permits
- Order components consistently across all bars for easier visual tracking
- Ensure the legend clearly identifies each component
- This variant is preferred over regular stacked bars when comparing proportions matters more than absolute values
