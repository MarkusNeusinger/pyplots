review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of 100% stacked area chart using Highcharts native stacking:
    percent feature'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between all three areas
  - Well-configured tooltip showing percentage values for interactive use
  - Realistic market share scenario that perfectly demonstrates the chart purpose
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins and text sizing
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines on the chart area, which could help readers trace values
    more precisely
  - 'Legend symbols use symbolRadius: 0 (squares) which is fine but circular markers
    might match the data point markers better'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing "Product
    Market Share Evolution (2018-2025)". Three distinct colored areas fill the chart
    from bottom to top: purple (Product C) at the bottom maintaining ~21-25%, yellow
    (Product B) in the middle declining from ~40% to ~24%, and steel blue (Product
    A) at the top growing from ~35% to ~55%. The Y-axis shows "Market Share (%)" with
    values from 0% to 100% in 2% increments. The X-axis shows years from 2018 to 2025.
    The title "area-stacked-percent · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    with a subtitle below. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all three products
    with colored squares. Data points are marked with small squares on each area boundary.
    The chart fills the canvas well with balanced margins.'

          Could leverage more advanced features like data labels or animation settings.'
