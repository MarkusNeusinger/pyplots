review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent no-overlap word placement with hand-crafted positions
  - Clean, readable visualization with clear frequency-based coloring
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with aes mappings and scale_identity
  - Professional color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic tech survey context that makes sense
  weaknesses:
  - Legend uses bullet symbols that do not match the actual word rendering style
  - Word size range could be more dramatic to better emphasize high vs low frequency
    differences
  - Some smaller words (AWS, Azure) are at the edge of comfortable readability
