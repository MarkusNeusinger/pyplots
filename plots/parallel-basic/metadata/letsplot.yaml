review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of parallel coordinates using lets-plot ggplot2 grammar
  - Clean visual separation of species clusters demonstrates visualization power
  - Proper normalization of dimensions to 0-1 scale for fair comparison
  - Descriptive axis labels with units enhance interpretability
  - Good color palette with sufficient contrast between species
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.7) handles line overlap effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Tick value labels (min/max) positioned slightly far from axes and could be larger
  - Yellow color for Versicolor could have more saturation for better visibility against
    white
