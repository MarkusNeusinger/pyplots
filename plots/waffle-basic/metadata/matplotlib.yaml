review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with rounded squares (FancyBboxPatch) giving a polished,
    modern look
  - Perfect color choices using Python blue/yellow plus colorblind-safe additions
  - Well-implemented 10x10 grid where each square = 1%, matching spec exactly
  - Clean legend with shadow and fancybox styling that is positioned appropriately
  - Correct title format following the pyplots.ai convention
  - Simple, readable KISS code structure without unnecessary complexity
  weaknesses:
  - Waffle charts benefit from a subtitle or annotation explaining what the data represents
  - Data could include a very small category to show how the chart handles edge cases
  - Could use additional matplotlib features like annotating total percentage per
    category on the chart
