review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic multimodal exam score distribution (3
    sub-populations)
  - Perfect spec compliance — all required features present including bargap=0, rangemode=tozero,
    and clear bin edges
  - All font sizes explicitly set for the 4800x2700 target resolution
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Leverages Plotly interactive strengths with hovertemplate and dual PNG/HTML export
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the bimodal/trimodal nature of the distribution goes uncommented
    — add annotations marking the main peak, high-achiever cluster, and struggling-students
    group'
  - 'Visual refinement is minimal: add a mean or median line, refine the grid further,
    consider spine removal or background color tweaks to elevate beyond defaults'
  - 'Canvas utilization could improve: reduce right-side whitespace, optimize margins
    for better plot-to-canvas ratio'
  - Could leverage more Plotly-distinctive features such as marginal rug plots, shape
    annotations, or statistical overlays
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of exam scores using Python Blue
    (#306998) bars on a clean white background (plotly_white template). The x-axis
    is labeled "Score (points)" ranging from approximately 37 to 102, and the y-axis
    is labeled "Frequency (count)" ranging from 0 to 45. The distribution is visibly
    multimodal: a main peak around 73-77 (reaching approximately 44 count), a secondary
    cluster around 85-90 (counts approximately 23-26), and a small group of low-performing
    scores around 40-50 (counts approximately 5-6). Bars have thin white edge lines
    separating them with no gaps between bins. Subtle gray grid lines aid readability.
    The title "histogram-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Overall
    layout is clean with balanced margins, though some white space on the right could
    be better utilized.'
