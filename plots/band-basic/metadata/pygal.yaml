review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color contrast between blue band and yellow center line, colorblind-safe
    palette
  - Creative polygon approach to create band effect in pygal which lacks native fill_between
  - Widening confidence interval clearly demonstrates increasing uncertainty over
    time
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Proper axis labels with units and descriptive legend
  weaknesses:
  - Visual artifact at right edge where the polygon closes creates a sharp triangular
    taper
  - 'Title format should start with spec-id pattern: band-basic · 95% Confidence Interval
    · pygal · pyplots.ai'
  - Grid lines are quite light/subtle, could be more visible for reference
