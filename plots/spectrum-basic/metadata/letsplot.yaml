review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with three distinct frequency peaks clearly visible
  - Proper use of dB scale for amplitude representation as specified
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar with geom_line and geom_area combination
  - Realistic signal processing data with fundamental, harmonics, and noise
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Good use of lets-plot theme customization for text sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could benefit from slightly more transparency (alpha currently at 0.3 which
    is acceptable but on the higher end)
  - HTML output path handling could be cleaner (uses path="." parameter)
