review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with theoretical PDF overlay
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue histogram, yellow PDF curve)
  - 'Title follows correct format: histogram-density · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate scale (centered around 75)
  - Proper use of Highcharts column series for histogram and area spline for PDF
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are slightly dense - could use fewer tick marks for cleaner
    appearance
  - Legend positioned in upper right could potentially overlap with tall bars in some
    datasets
