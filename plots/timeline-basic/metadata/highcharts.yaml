review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of timeline concept using scatter plot with alternating
    y-positions
  - Clean alternating label placement above/below axis prevents text overlap
  - Colorblind-safe palette correctly applied to 5 distinct categories
  - Proper use of Highcharts datetime axis with appropriate formatting
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Central axis line using plotLines is an elegant Highcharts feature
  - Large markers with white borders ensure visibility
  - Realistic software development milestone scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit axis labels (y-axis is conceptual for timeline but VQ-06 criteria
    expects labels)
  - Slight excess bottom margin creates minor whitespace imbalance
