review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with subtitle context (Top 3 providers control 67%)
    and callout annotation highlighting AWS leadership
  - 'Strong visual polish: custom shadows, border styling, crooked connectors, exploded
    leader slice with distinct border'
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all requirements from specification met (percentage
    labels, distinct colors, legend, exploded slice)'
  - Idiomatic Highcharts usage with point-level customization and interactive state
    configuration
  - Realistic, neutral data context (cloud infrastructure market share)
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance: significant vertical gap between pie chart and callout/legend
    area wastes canvas space — consider moving callout closer or using Highcharts
    native annotations'
  - The callout annotation uses a CSS overlay div rather than Highcharts built-in
    annotation API, which would be more idiomatic and easier to position relative
    to the chart
  - Minor label crowding between Alibaba 4.0% and Google Cloud 11.0% — adjusting startAngle
    or label distance could improve spacing
  - PIL/Pillow imported solely for a crop operation — could potentially adjust window-size
    and chart height to avoid the extra dependency
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "Cloud Infrastructure Market
    Share · pie-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" on a white background in 3600×3600
    square format. Five slices represent cloud providers: AWS (31.0%, dark teal-blue,
    exploded outward), Azure (25.0%, golden yellow), Google Cloud (11.0%, burnt orange),
    Alibaba (4.0%, cyan), and Others (29.0%, purple). Each slice has bold data labels
    showing the provider name and percentage, connected by gray connector lines. The
    subtitle reads "Global cloud spending by provider, 2024 — Top 3 providers control
    67% of the market." A dark gradient callout box near the bottom states "AWS leads
    with nearly ⅓ of global cloud revenue" with a blue left border accent. A horizontal
    legend at the very bottom shows colored circles for each category. The color palette
    is colorblind-safe with good contrast between all slices.'
