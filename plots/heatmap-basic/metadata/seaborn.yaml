review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging RdBu colormap centered at 50, making it easy to distinguish
    above/below average performance
  - Data patterns are intentionally crafted to demonstrate heatmap capabilities (Sales
    strong first half, Engineering strong second half, Finance consistently stable,
    HR mid-year dip)
  - Cell annotations with appropriate font size (16pt) make exact values readable
    without cluttering
  - Square figure format (12×12) is perfect for this 7×12 matrix, allowing cells to
    be nearly square
  - White gridlines with linewidth=1 provide clear cell separation without being distracting
  - Colorbar properly configured with shrink, label, and tick formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Could use sns.clustermap or add dendrograms to showcase seaborn clustering capabilities
    as mentioned in spec notes
  - Colorbar label is set twice (in cbar_kws and manually), which is redundant code
  image_description: 'The heatmap displays a 7×12 matrix showing monthly performance
    scores (0-100) across 7 departments (Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Support, Finance,
    HR, Operations) over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The plot uses a diverging RdBu (Red-Blue)
    colormap centered at 50, where blue indicates high performance (approaching 100)
    and red indicates low performance (approaching 0). Each cell contains a white
    numeric annotation showing the exact score. White grid lines separate the cells.
    The colorbar on the right is labeled "Performance Score" with a 0-100 scale. The
    title "heatmap-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels "Month"
    (x-axis) and "Department" (y-axis) are clearly visible. Notable patterns include:
    Finance row is consistently blue (high scores 74-91), Sales shows strong first
    half (80-95) then drops, Engineering has strong second half performance (75-95
    in Aug-Nov), and HR has a mid-year dip (11 in April).'

        comment: Uses sns.heatmap which is core seaborn, but doesn't leverage seaborn-specific
          features like clustermap for hierarchical clustering
  verdict: APPROVED
