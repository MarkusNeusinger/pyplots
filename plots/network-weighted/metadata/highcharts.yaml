review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of weighted network graph using Highcharts networkgraph
    module
  - Node sizing by weighted degree adds meaningful visual information
  - Custom legend clearly explains the edge weight scale
  - Force-directed layout with verlet integration provides good node positioning
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each department
  - Clean data structure with realistic university collaboration scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in bottom-left is far from the main visualization
  - Network could utilize more of the canvas space for better visibility
  - Post-render timeout approach for link widths is a workaround rather than native
    solution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a weighted network graph showing university
    department collaboration patterns. There are 12 department nodes rendered as colored
    circles: CS (blue), MATH (blue), PHYS (purple), STAT (cyan), EE (brown), ME (pink),
    BIO (gray), CHEM (olive-yellow), ECON (blue), PSYCH (orange), MED (green), and
    ENV (red). Node sizes vary based on weighted degree - BIO and CS appear as the
    largest nodes indicating highest collaboration activity. Edges connect departments
    with varying thickness representing the number of joint publications (ranging
    from 15 to 55). The thickest edges connect BIO-MED (55 publications) and CS-EE
    (52 publications). A legend in the bottom-left corner explains the edge weight
    scale with three line thickness examples. The title ''network-weighted · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai'' appears at the top with a subtitle ''University Department Collaboration
    Network''. The network uses a force-directed layout centered in the canvas.'
