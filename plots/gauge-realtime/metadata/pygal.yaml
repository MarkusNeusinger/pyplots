review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of multiple gauges to demonstrate real-time temporal progression
  - Clear color coding with intuitive red/yellow zones for status indication
  - Good legend design showing zone status for each time point
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with plausible value progression
  weaknesses:
  - Missing min/max boundary labels on gauges (spec requires "Include min and max
    labels at the gauge boundaries")
  - No green (Normal) zone values displayed - spec requires green/yellow/red zones
    but only warning and critical are shown
  - Duplicate value display (inside arc and below) adds visual noise
  image_description: 'The plot displays four half-pie solid gauge charts arranged
    in a 2x2 grid on a white background. The title "gauge-realtime · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top in dark gray text. Each gauge shows a CPU usage percentage
    value both inside the arc and below it. The gauges represent time-series data:
    Current (85%), t-1 (82%), t-2 (75%), and t-3 (65%). Color coding indicates status
    zones: coral/red (#E74C3C) for Critical values (85% and 82%) and golden yellow
    (#F1C40F) for Warning values (75% and 65%). The unfilled portion of each gauge
    is light gray. A legend at the bottom shows all four series with their zone status
    labels. The layout effectively demonstrates the real-time nature by showing temporal
    progression of values.'
