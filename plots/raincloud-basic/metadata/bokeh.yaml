review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud metaphor with cloud above, boxplot in
    middle, rain below
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B demonstrates the power of raincloud plots
    to reveal hidden patterns
  - 'Good use of Bokeh interactivity: HoverTool shows group statistics, legend items
    can be clicked to hide/show'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Manual KDE calculation using Silverman's rule shows attention to statistical accuracy
  - Clean horizontal layout with proper spacing between groups
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears to have visual artifacts/duplication in the top-right corner area
  - Scatter point size (12) could be slightly larger for better visibility at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Box plot height (0.08) is quite thin relative to the cloud and rain elements
