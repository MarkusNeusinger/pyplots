review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with subtitle, interpretation box, and p-value creating
    a clear narrative arc
  - White-outline technique on the focal distribution (Bad Customers) is a sophisticated
    visual separation method
  - Gradient-style shaded band at the K-S distance point adds visual emphasis without
    clutter
  - Double-ended arrow annotation with connectionstyle is a polished way to show the
    K-S distance
  - Realistic credit scoring context directly from the spec suggested applications
  - All font sizes explicitly set to appropriate values for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Gradient shading loop (lines 60-63) is slightly over-engineered; a simpler approach
    could achieve a similar effect with less code
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step functions on a clean light-gray (#FAFAFA) background. The "Bad
    Customers" ECDF is rendered as an orange (#E5921A) dashed line with a white outline
    behind it for visual separation from gridlines, while the "Good Customers" ECDF
    is a solid blue (#306998) line. A double-ended dotted arrow connects the two curves
    at the point of maximum divergence (around credit score ~50), with dark circular
    endpoint markers that have white edges. A gradient-style blue shaded band highlights
    the narrow region of maximum divergence. The K-S statistic "D = 0.722" is prominently
    annotated in a rounded white box with a curved arrow pointing to the midpoint
    of the distance line. The title reads "ks-test-comparison · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    in medium weight at 24pt, with an italic subtitle below it stating "K-S test reveals
    bad customers cluster at low scores while good customers spread higher." The x-axis
    is labeled "Credit Score (0–100)" and the y-axis "Cumulative Proportion (0–1)"
    both at 20pt. In the lower right corner, an interpretation box with a light blue-gray
    background states "Strong separation: distributions are significantly different"
    and below it "p-value < 0.001" is displayed in italic gray text. The legend is
    positioned in the upper left with clear labels for both distributions. Top and
    right spines are removed, and subtle y-axis gridlines (alpha=0.15) provide reference
    without visual noise.'
