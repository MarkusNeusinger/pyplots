review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe viridis palette implementation
  - Clean title format following spec requirements exactly
  - Good axis labeling with units
  - Proper use of Highcharts heatmap module with inline JS for headless rendering
  - Well-positioned colorbar with clear intensity scale
  weaknesses:
  - Uses heatmap instead of true contour lines (isolines) - the spec explicitly requests
    isolines but none are drawn
  - No contour level labels on the plot as suggested in the spec notes
  - Grid resolution (50x50) creates slightly blocky appearance rather than smooth
    contours
  - Missing grid lines that could help with coordinate reading
