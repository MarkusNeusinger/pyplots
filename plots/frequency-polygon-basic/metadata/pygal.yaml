review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of frequency polygon concept using pygal XY chart
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper data generation with three distinct distributions showing different characteristics
  - Lines correctly extended to zero at both ends to close polygon shapes
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend items spread too far apart at bottom; could be more compact
  - Does not use pygal fill option for semi-transparent fill beneath lines
  - Only horizontal grid lines shown; vertical guides disabled
  image_description: "The plot displays a frequency polygon chart comparing three\
    \ plant height distributions by soil type. Three colored lines with markers connect\
    \ the midpoints of histogram bins:\n\n- Blue (Sandy Soil): Left-shifted distribution\
    \ peaking around 45cm with frequency ~53, showing a narrower spread\n- Yellow\
    \ (Loamy Soil): Center-right distribution peaking around 60cm with frequency ~37,\
    \ showing the widest spread  \n- Green (Clay Soil): Right-shifted distribution\
    \ peaking sharply around 57-60cm with frequency ~57, showing the narrowest spread\n\
    \nThe title \"frequency-polygon-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai\" is displayed at top\
    \ center. X-axis labeled \"Plant Height (cm)\" ranges from 20-90, Y-axis labeled\
    \ \"Frequency\" ranges from 0-60. Horizontal dashed grid lines aid reading. Legend\
    \ appears at bottom left showing colored squares for each soil type. All three\
    \ lines extend to zero at both ends, properly closing the polygon shapes. Circular\
    \ markers are visible at each data point."
