review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GridSpec layout with main panel spanning 2 rows and 2 columns, demonstrating
    the core spec feature
  - Professional financial dashboard aesthetic with consistent color scheme (Python
    blue/yellow)
  - 'Good use of matplotlib-specific features: GridSpec with height_ratios, fill_between,
    mdates formatting'
  - All text is clearly legible with appropriate font sizes
  - Realistic financial data scenario with time series, volume, returns distribution,
    and summary statistics
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom row subplots appear slightly cramped compared to the main panel proportions
  - Library features score could be improved by using shared axes between related
    plots (e.g., dates) or constrained_layout
