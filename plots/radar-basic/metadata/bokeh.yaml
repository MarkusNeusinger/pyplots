review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent radar chart implementation with proper polar-to-cartesian coordinate
    conversion
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.25) for overlapping polygon visibility as spec
    requires
  - Smart text alignment logic for category labels based on position around the circle
  - 'Clean color scheme with Python colors (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B) that are
    distinguishable'
  - Proper square aspect ratio (3600x3600) for radar chart symmetry
  - Grid circles at correct intervals (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) as spec requests
  weaknesses:
  - Grid scale values (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) are not labeled on the chart, making it
    harder to read exact values
  - Legend is positioned in corner far from the chart - could be integrated better
  - No hover interactivity despite Bokeh being an interactive library
