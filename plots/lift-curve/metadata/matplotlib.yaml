  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lift curve with proper calculation methodology (sort
    by score, cumulative lift at each percentage)
  - Clear visual distinction between model lift curve and random baseline with appropriate
    colors
  - Well-placed decile annotations that show practical lift values at key targeting
    thresholds
  - Shaded area between curves provides intuitive visualization of model value
  - Realistic customer response data with appropriate base rate and sample size
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarification (e.g., Cumulative Lift (ratio))
  - Does not leverage distinctive matplotlib features beyond basic plotting capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve with a solid blue line showing
    the model lift decreasing from approximately 6.5x at 0% population down to 1x
    at 100% population. A horizontal yellow dashed reference line at y=1 represents
    random selection. Key decile markers are shown at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%
    with their lift values annotated (6.14x, 4.28x, 3.14x, 2.45x, 2.00x respectively).
    The area between the lift curve and the reference line is filled with a light
    blue shade for visual emphasis. The title reads "lift-curve · matplotlib · pyplots.ai",
    x-axis is labeled "Population Targeted (%)", and y-axis is labeled "Cumulative
    Lift". A legend in the upper right identifies the blue line as "Model Lift" and
    yellow dashed line as "Random (Lift = 1)". The plot uses a subtle gray grid with
    dashed lines.
