review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of position_fill() for 100% stacking with matching text positioning
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper aesthetic mappings
  - Well-chosen color palette using Python Blue as primary color with harmonious complements
  - Percentage labels only shown for segments >= 8%, avoiding clutter
  - Proper categorical ordering ensures consistent segment order across all bars
  - Theme customization provides excellent text legibility at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis scale shows 0.00-1.00 (proportions) while label says Market Share (%) -
    minor inconsistency but not misleading since percentages are labeled in bars
