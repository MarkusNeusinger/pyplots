review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data generation logic
  - Confidence band appropriately widens over time showing realistic forecast uncertainty
    behavior
  - Uses Altair layered chart composition effectively (band + line + points)
  - Interactive HTML export includes useful tooltips for exploration
  - Consistent color scheme with good contrast between line and band
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered PNG despite code attempting to create one
    using resolve_legend - this violates spec requirement for legend that clearly
    identifies both the central line and confidence band
  - Y-axis starts at 0 but data ranges ~90-180, wasting nearly half the vertical canvas
    space (the code calculates y_domain but Altair appears to ignore it or it is not
    applied correctly to all layers)
