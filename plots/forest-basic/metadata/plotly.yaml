review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent forest plot structure with studies displayed as squares with horizontal
    CI whiskers
  - Diamond shape for pooled estimate is clearly visible and properly positioned at
    bottom
  - Good use of Plotly features including hover tooltips with study details
  - Clear visual annotations for Favors Treatment/Favors Control directions
  - Marker sizes correctly scaled proportional to study weights
  - 'Title follows correct format: forest-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - Studies are not ordered by effect size or chronologically as suggested in spec
    - they appear in arbitrary order
  - The No Effect annotation placement could be slightly more prominent
