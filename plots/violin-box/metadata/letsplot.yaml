review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of violin and box plot showing both KDE density and summary
    statistics
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper layering
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with four distinct colors
  - Realistic server response time scenario with varied distributions
  - Proper font sizing following lets-plot guidelines (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Outliers clearly visible as hollow circles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is hidden (legend_position=none) - while x-axis labels work as identifiers,
    keeping a legend could add clarity
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for the HTML export
  - Bimodal distribution in Premium group is somewhat subtle, could be more pronounced
  image_description: 'The plot displays a violin plot with embedded box plots showing
    server response times (ms) across four server configurations: Standard, Optimized,
    Premium, and Enterprise. Each violin is colored distinctly - Standard is blue
    (#306998), Optimized is yellow (#FFD43B), Premium is teal (#4A90A4), and Enterprise
    is green (#7CB342). White box plots are centered inside each violin showing median,
    quartiles, and whiskers. Outliers are displayed as hollow circles. The title "violin-box
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)"
    ranging from 0-140, X-axis shows "Server Configuration". The plot uses a minimal
    theme with subtle horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: Grid is subtle (good), but legend is hidden when colors are mapped
          to categories - this is acceptable since x-axis labels serve as legend

        comment: Uses ggplot2-style grammar with geom_violin and geom_boxplot layering,
          theme_minimal, scale_fill_manual. Could leverage more lets-plot specific
          features like tooltips for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
