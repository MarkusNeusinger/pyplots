quality_score: 93
review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: every feature from the specification is implemented
    including the optional bar overlay'
  - 'Strong data storytelling: elbow annotation with arrow, threshold crossing vertical
    lines, and visual hierarchy guide the viewer'
  - Real dataset (Wine) provides authentic PCA variance distribution rather than synthetic
    data
  - Clean, well-organized code with idiomatic Plotly patterns
  - Good use of Plotly-specific features (spline, hover templates, fill, HTML export)
  - Color palette is cohesive and colorblind-safe
  weaknesses:
  - The 90% and 95% threshold labels are positioned close together in the top-left,
    creating slight visual crowding
  - The filled area under the cumulative curve (rgba 0.08 opacity) extends across
    the full plot and slightly competes with the bars for visual attention
  - Legend could include the threshold lines for completeness
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance curve for
    PCA on the Wine dataset with 13 principal components. A smooth blue spline line
    with circular white-outlined markers shows the cumulative variance rising from
    ~33% (PC1) to 100% (PC13). Light blue semi-transparent bars beneath show individual
    variance contributions, with PC1 dominating at ~33% and subsequent components
    declining rapidly. Two horizontal dashed threshold lines are drawn: an orange
    line at 90% and a red/crimson line at 95%, each labeled on the left side. Vertical
    dotted lines drop from the cumulative curve at the threshold crossing points (~PC8
    for 90%, ~PC10 for 95%). A red diamond marker at PC4 (~74%) is annotated as the
    "Elbow" point with an arrow and boxed label. The background is very light off-white
    with subtle gridlines on the y-axis only. A legend in the lower-left shows "Individual"
    (bar) and "Cumulative" (line) entries. The title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top.'
