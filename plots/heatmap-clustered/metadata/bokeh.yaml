quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hierarchical clustering with dendrograms on both axes
  - Clean dendrogram rendering with proper coordinate transformation
  - Realistic gene expression dataset with biologically meaningful patterns (tumor
    vs normal)
  - Good use of Bokeh layout system to compose multiple figures
  - Proper diverging colormap (RdBu11) centered at zero for expression data
  - Clear visual separation between sample clusters matches biological expectations
  weaknesses:
  - Missing hover tooltips showing gene name, sample name, and exact value (key Bokeh
    interactive feature)
  - Colorbar title is rotated 90 degrees making it harder to read
