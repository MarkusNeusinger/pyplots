review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of phase space dynamics with clear spiral convergence
    to equilibrium
  - Multiple trajectories from different initial conditions beautifully demonstrate
    the basin of attraction
  - Direction arrows effectively show time evolution as required by spec
  - Clean, publication-quality aesthetics with well-chosen color palette
  - Proper use of analytical solution ensures smooth, accurate trajectories
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Position x (m)" or "(arbitrary units)" would be
    clearer)
  - Legend fontsize (14) could be increased to 16 for consistency with tick labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phase diagram for a damped harmonic oscillator
    showing four spiral trajectories converging toward the origin (equilibrium point).
    The trajectories are colored in a distinct palette: blue (Python Blue #306998),
    yellow, coral/red, and teal. Each trajectory starts from a large circular marker
    indicating initial conditions and spirals clockwise inward toward the origin,
    where a large black X marks the stable equilibrium point. Direction arrows are
    placed along each trajectory showing the time evolution. The x-axis is labeled
    "Position x" and the y-axis "Velocity dx/dt". The title reads "Damped Oscillator
    · phase-diagram · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper right identifies
    each trajectory with its amplitude parameter. Subtle gray dashed reference lines
    mark the axes at x=0 and y=0. The plot uses equal aspect ratio with axis limits
    from -4 to 4 (x) and -3.5 to 3.5 (y).'

        comment: Good use of annotate with arrowprops, scatter with edge colors, axhline/axvline;
          could leverage matplotlib's FancyArrowPatch or quiver for more sophisticated
          direction arrows
  verdict: APPROVED
