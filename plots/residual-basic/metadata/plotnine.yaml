review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including reference line at
    y=0, LOWESS trend line, and transparent points
  - Clean grammar of graphics syntax with proper layering (hline → smooth → points)
  - Symmetric y-axis implementation as recommended in spec
  - Realistic data generation with heteroscedasticity pattern and outliers for diagnostic
    demonstration
  - Proper font sizing and theme customization for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for generic residuals, units may not be applicable)
  - Grid styling could use slightly higher alpha for better visibility (currently
    0.3)
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot with approximately 150 blue
    scatter points (#306998) plotted against fitted values. A solid black horizontal
    reference line at y=0 helps assess systematic bias. A yellow/gold LOWESS smoothed
    trend line traverses the plot, showing the residuals are mostly centered around
    zero with slight variation. The x-axis is labeled "Fitted Values" (ranging from
    ~10 to 90), and the y-axis is labeled "Residuals" (symmetric range from -30 to
    +30). The title "residual-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the
    top. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle dashed gray grid lines. Points
    have moderate transparency (alpha=0.6) allowing density visualization. Several
    outliers are visible (around +25 at x≈85, -22 at x≈55), demonstrating heteroscedasticity
    pattern where variance increases with fitted values.

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_hline, geom_smooth
          (LOWESS), theme_minimal, and proper theming. Could have used more advanced
          features like faceting or custom scales.
  verdict: APPROVED
