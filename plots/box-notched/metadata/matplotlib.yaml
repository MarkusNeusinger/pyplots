review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of notch=True with patch_artist for visually distinct, colored boxes
  - 'Thoughtful data design: Engineering vs Support shows non-overlapping notches
    (significant difference), Sales vs Marketing shows overlapping notches (no significant
    difference) - perfectly demonstrates the spec purpose'
  - Helpful annotation explaining what non-overlapping notches mean for statistical
    interpretation
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Explicit outliers in Support department showcase the outlier detection feature
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python blue
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units for full clarity (e.g., Performance Score (0-100))
