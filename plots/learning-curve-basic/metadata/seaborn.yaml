review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (Python blue/yellow) that are
    both aesthetically pleasing and colorblind-safe
  - Perfect implementation of learning curve pattern showing the classic bias-variance
    tradeoff visualization
  - Proper use of seaborn styling (set_context, set_style) creating a polished, professional
    appearance
  - Text sizing follows best practices exactly (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Confidence bands are appropriately transparent (alpha=0.2) making overlapping
    regions visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Accuracy Score (0-1)" or "Training Set Size (samples)"
    would be clearer)
  - fill_between is used directly from matplotlib rather than a seaborn-native approach
  - Data scenario is generic rather than depicting a specific real-world ML application
  image_description: The plot displays a learning curve with two lines and shaded
    confidence bands on a white/gray grid background. The training score line (blue
    with circle markers) starts at approximately 0.98 and gradually decreases to around
    0.95. The validation score line (yellow/gold with square markers) starts at approximately
    0.67 and increases asymptotically toward 0.90. Both curves have semi-transparent
    shaded regions representing the standard deviation bands (±1 std). The x-axis
    shows "Training Set Size" ranging from 0 to 2000, and the y-axis shows "Accuracy
    Score" ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. The title reads "learning-curve-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" and a legend in the lower right distinguishes Training Score from
    Validation Score.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot and sns.set_context/set_style but fill_between
          is from matplotlib. Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like FacetGrid
          or relplot for a more seaborn-native approach
  verdict: APPROVED
