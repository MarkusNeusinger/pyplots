review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Highcharts polar chart with proper compass direction
    formatting
  - Well-designed wind data with realistic prevailing direction clustering
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple) for time-of-day categories
  - Good code structure with inline JS for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Proper use of highcharts-more.js for polar chart functionality
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size could be slightly larger (radius 14 is adequate but could be ~18 for
    better visibility at 3600x3600)
  image_description: 'The polar scatter chart displays wind direction and speed distribution
    on a white background. The main title "polar-scatter · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears in bold at the top, with a subtitle "Wind Direction and Speed Distribution"
    below it. The circular polar plot shows compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW,
    W, NW) around the perimeter, with concentric gridlines at 0, 7, 14, and 21 m/s
    intervals. Data points are displayed in three colors: blue (Morning), yellow (Afternoon),
    and purple (Evening). The 120 data points show realistic clustering around NE
    (~45°), SW (~225°), and W (~270°) directions, representing prevailing wind patterns.
    The legend at the bottom clearly identifies the three time-of-day categories.'
