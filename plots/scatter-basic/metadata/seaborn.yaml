review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.regplot() — the distinctive seaborn feature that combines
    scatter, regression line, and confidence interval in one call
  - Correlation annotation (r = 0.86) with styled bbox provides meaningful data storytelling
  - Intentional outliers (gifted student at 2.5h/95pts, underperformer at 8.5h/28pts)
    make the data realistic and demonstrate scatter patterns well
  - Perfect text sizing with all font sizes explicitly set to appropriate values
  - Clean despined aesthetic with subtle grid, muted non-data colors, and well-balanced
    layout
  - Slight curvature in data generation (diminishing returns) adds realism beyond
    simple linear noise
  weaknesses:
  - DE-01 could reach 7-8 with more sophisticated color palette choices or additional
    typographic refinement
  - Grid could be refined further — y-axis-only grid might look cleaner for a scatter
    plot
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot of 150 data points showing the
    relationship between "Study Hours (per week)" (x-axis, range ~1-10) and "Exam
    Score (points)" (y-axis, range ~20-125). Data points are rendered as medium-blue
    (#306998) filled circles with white edges and moderate transparency (alpha=0.6).
    A red (#c44e52) regression line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right,
    accompanied by a light pink 95% confidence interval band. The title reads "scatter-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in medium-weight dark gray text at the top. Axis labels
    are descriptive with units. A correlation annotation "r = 0.86" is placed in the
    lower-right corner inside a rounded white box with a light gray border. The plot
    uses a clean, despined style (no top/right spines) with subtle dashed grid lines.
    The overall layout is well-balanced on a 16:9 canvas with generous whitespace.
