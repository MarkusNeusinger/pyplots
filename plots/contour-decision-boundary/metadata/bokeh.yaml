review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of Bokeh image() for rendering the decision boundary regions efficiently
  - Clear visual distinction between classes using Python-themed blue/yellow colors
  - Misclassified points highlighted with contrasting red X markers
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate marker sizing and alpha values for 200 data points
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is missing an entry for misclassified points (the red X markers)
  - Legend text size appears slightly smaller than optimal for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - No HoverTool or other Bokeh interactive features utilized
