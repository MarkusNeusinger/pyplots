review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular parliament visualization with proper arc arrangement
  - Seats correctly distributed with more seats in outer rows (realistic parliament
    layout)
  - Well-configured legend with party names and seat counts
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with custom color scales
  - Proper title format and good color accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Large gap between the parliament chart and the legend creates visual disconnection
  - Uses political party theme which content policy suggests avoiding for neutral
    topics
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    300 seats arranged in 5 concentric arcs. Seats are rendered as circular dots colored
    by party: Progressive (blue, 95 seats) on the left, followed by Conservative (yellow,
    82 seats), Green (green, 45 seats), Liberal (orange, 38 seats), Social Dem. (purple,
    28 seats), and Independent (brown, 12 seats) on the right. The title "parliament-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A horizontal legend at the bottom
    shows all parties with seat counts in parentheses, arranged in 3 columns. The
    semicircle fills the canvas well from left to right.'
