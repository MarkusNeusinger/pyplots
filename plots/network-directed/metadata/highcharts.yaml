review:
  strengths:
  - Clear hierarchical layout showing software module dependencies in logical layers
  - Properly implemented directional arrows using custom SVG rendering
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme (yellow nodes, blue edges)
  - Fixed node positions ensure reproducibility across runs
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Realistic software architecture example that demonstrates practical use case
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels are readable but slightly small for the 4800x2700 canvas; increasing
    font size would improve legibility
  - Significant empty space on left and right margins - nodes could be spread wider
    to better utilize canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a directed network graph showing software module
    dependencies. It features 12 yellow circular nodes labeled with module names (main,
    api, auth, database, models, utils, config, cache, logging, validation, routes,
    middleware) arranged in a hierarchical layout. Blue directional edges (arrows)
    connect the nodes, indicating import dependencies - arrows point from the importing
    module to the imported module. The title "network-directed · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Software Module Dependencies (arrows
    show import direction)" below it. The graph is arranged across approximately 4-5
    layers showing the hierarchy from main at the top down to cache and utils at the
    bottom.
