review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent flag positioning with alternating heights to avoid overlap
  - Distinct markers and colors for each event type make it easy to identify events
    at a glance
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility and a clear price narrative
  - Clean annotation boxes with rounded corners and colored borders matching event
    types
  - Good use of vertical dashed connector lines for precise date alignment
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position overlaps with the beginning of the price line and first event
    flag area
  - The stock split event should ideally show the price adjustment that occurs during
    a real split
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price time series from January 2025
    to September 2025, rendered as a blue line chart with a light blue area fill beneath.
    The stock price ranges approximately from $115 to $165, with realistic volatility
    showing a downtrend from ~$150 to ~$122 in the first half, followed by a recovery
    to ~$148 by the end. Eight event flags are displayed with distinct markers and
    colors: blue squares for earnings (Q4, Q1, Q2 Earnings), green diamonds for dividends
    (Div $0.50, Div $0.55), purple triangle for split (2:1 Split), and orange circles
    for news (Product Launch, Partnership). Each event has a vertical dashed connector
    line linking the marker on the price line to a text label in a rounded box positioned
    above or below the price. The flags alternate positions to avoid overlap. A legend
    in the upper left clearly identifies event types. The title follows the required
    format "stock-event-flags · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
