review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar for encoding streamline data with
    color mapped to velocity
  - Beautiful viridis colormap that is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  - Well-balanced layout with good canvas utilization
  - Creative solution for streamline visualization in a library without native streamline
    support
  - Properly generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (vector_field, compute_streamline) instead of KISS
    flat structure
  - Grid lines are not visible despite being configured (gridOpacity may need adjustment)
  - Axis labels lack units (even generic ones like units would help)
