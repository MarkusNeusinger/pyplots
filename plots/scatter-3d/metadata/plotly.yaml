review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's Scatter3d with proper colorscale and colorbar
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  - Good camera angle providing clear 3D perspective
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar title font could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Data uses generic coordinate labels rather than a more compelling real-world scenario
  - Could leverage Plotly's hover templates for richer interactivity
