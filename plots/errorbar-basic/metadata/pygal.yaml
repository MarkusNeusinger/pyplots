review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of error bars using pygal XY chart despite lack of native
    error bar support
  - Properly demonstrates asymmetric error bars (Treatment C and D)
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled font sizes for the canvas
  - Realistic scientific context with control and treatment groups
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace in lower portion of
    plot (data ranges ~23-55)
  - Error bar caps could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
  - Does not leverage pygal interactive features (tooltips showing exact values would
    enhance the visualization)
  image_description: The plot displays a basic error bar chart with 6 experimental
    groups (Control, Treatment A through E) on the x-axis and Response Value (units)
    on the y-axis ranging from 0 to ~55. Each data point is represented by a blue
    (#306998) filled circle with vertical error bars extending above and below, terminated
    by horizontal caps. The title "errorbar-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. The background is white with subtle horizontal grid lines. Treatment
    C and D show notably asymmetric error bars as intended by the data. The layout
    is clean with good use of the canvas space.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick labels are all readable. Font sizes
          are appropriately scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas. Slight deduction as tick
          labels could be slightly larger.

        comment: Data points (dots_size=22) and error bars (stroke_width=5) are well-sized

        comment: Good canvas utilization with data occupying the upper portion. Slight
          imbalance as y-axis starts at 0 but data ranges from ~23-55, leaving lower
          portion empty.

        comment: Y-axis has "Response Value (units)" with units; X-axis has "Experimental
          Group" which is descriptive.

        comment: Horizontal grid lines are subtle and helpful. No legend shown (appropriate
          since single series), but the legend is disabled rather than elegantly handled.

        comment: Error bars with caps present, asymmetric errors supported. Spec mentions
          "visible caps" which are implemented, though caps could be slightly more

        comment: Shows both symmetric (Control, Treatment E) and asymmetric error
          bars (Treatment C, D). Good variety in mean values. Could show more dramatic
          asymmetry to better demonstrate the feature.

        comment: Values in 25-50 range are plausible for generic "response values."
          Errors of 2-6 units are reasonable. The context is somewhat generic.

        comment: Uses pygal's XY chart and custom Style effectively. Creative manual
          construction of error bars using multiple series. However, pygal doesn't
          have native error bar support, so this is a workaround rather than leveraging
          distinctive pygal features like interactivity or tooltips.
  verdict: APPROVED
