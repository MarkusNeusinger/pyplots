review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of scatter matrix concept using pygal individual chart
    rendering combined into a composite image
  - Clean visual design with consistent styling across all cells
  - Correct title format and variable labeling on both axes
  - Good use of histograms on diagonal showing univariate distributions
  - Appropriate color scheme with transparency for scatter points
  - HTML output provided for interactive viewing reference
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter point size (dots_size=6) is slightly small for 100 data points at 3600px
    resolution; increasing to 8-10 would improve visibility
  - Left margin labels could be positioned slightly closer to the plot area
  - No negative correlation examples in the synthetic data - all variables are positively
    correlated
  - Code complexity due to composite image assembly approach rather than native pygal
    matrix support
