review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Highcharts-specific features: plot bands for threshold zones,
    gradient area fill, and annotations with callout styling'
  - Professional real-time monitoring appearance with current value display and directional
    arrow indicator
  - Well-designed color scheme with meaningful zone indicators (blue/yellow/red for
    normal/warning/critical)
  - Realistic CPU usage data with appropriate patterns (base load, oscillations, spikes)
  - Proper subtitle showing current value enhances the real-time dashboard feel
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title Time (sliding window) may be cut off in some renders
  - No explicit fade effect on trailing edge as suggested in spec notes (though arrow
    indicator partially addresses this)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time style area chart showing CPU usage
    as a percentage over a ~12 second time window (14:30:00 to 14:30:12). The main
    data line is rendered in blue (#306998) with a gradient fill that transitions
    from semi-transparent blue at the top to nearly transparent at the bottom. The
    y-axis ranges from 0% to 100% and is divided into three color-coded zones via
    plot bands: light blue (0-50%, normal), light yellow (50-80%, warning), and light
    pink (80-100%, critical). The title "line-realtime · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed prominently at the top, with a subtitle "CPU Usage Monitor — Current:
    37.3% ▶" indicating the real-time nature. A "Latest: 37.3%" callout annotation
    appears at the rightmost data point. The legend showing "CPU Usage" is positioned
    in the upper right corner. The x-axis shows time labels in HH:MM:SS format, and
    the y-axis is labeled "CPU Usage (%)". The data shows realistic CPU usage patterns
    with oscillations and multiple spikes reaching up to ~80%.'
