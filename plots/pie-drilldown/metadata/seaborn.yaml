review:
  strengths:
  - Clean visual representation of drilldown concept with side-by-side comparison
  - Breadcrumb navigation and back button annotations effectively communicate the
    UI concept
  - Good color scheme consistency between parent and child categories
  - Realistic sales data scenario with appropriate value ranges
  - Well-balanced layout with two charts utilizing the canvas effectively
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Does not use seaborn library at all - only matplotlib is imported and
    used'
  - Minor text overlap on smaller pie slices (Books/Sports percentages)
  - Static representation cannot show the interactive drilldown functionality described
    in spec
  - Missing visual indicator that slices are clickable (only text annotation, no cursor/icon
    change)
