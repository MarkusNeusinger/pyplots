review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis eliminates text overlap
  - Clean visual design with white label boxes bordered by category colors
  - Appropriate use of matplotlib.dates for professional date formatting
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with good contrast
  - KISS code structure that is easy to read and maintain
  weaknesses:
  - Timeline lacks axis labels - a descriptive label like Project Timeline could enhance
    clarity
  - Event spacing is relatively uniform - could demonstrate more varied intervals
    between milestones
