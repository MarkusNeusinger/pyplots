review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of complex Circos geometry using Bokeh patches and basic
    primitives
  - Clear, colorblind-friendly color palette with distinct colors for each region
  - Well-structured code with good data flow (trade matrix to segment calculations
    to ribbon rendering)
  - Realistic trade flow data between economic regions with appropriate GDP growth
    inner track
  - Proper use of quadratic Bezier curves for smooth ribbon connections
  - Good use of alpha transparency for overlapping ribbons
  weaknesses:
  - Region labels around the circle are small (20pt) and should be increased for better
    readability at the canvas size
  - Inner track annotation at bottom-left is very small (14pt) and positioned far
    from the track
  - Title font size (32pt) is smaller than recommended for 3600x3600 canvas
