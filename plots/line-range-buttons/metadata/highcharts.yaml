review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect implementation of all required range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD,
    1Y, All)
  - 'Excellent use of Highstock features: navigator, scrollbar, date input fields'
  - Active button (1Y) is clearly highlighted with different background color
  - Clean visual design with consistent color scheme (#306998)
  - Good data generation with realistic trend and seasonality over 3 years
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label is generic (Value); could benefit from more descriptive context
  - X-axis tick labels are dense for 1Y view; consider fewer ticks or auto-formatting
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a time series line chart with range selector buttons. The title "line-range-buttons · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at the top center. On the upper left, there are six range selector buttons labeled "1M", "3M", "6M", "YTD", "1Y", and "All". The "1Y" button is highlighted with a blue background indicating it is the currently selected range. Date input fields are visible in the upper right showing "Dec 30, 2024" to "Dec 30, 2025".

    The main chart area shows a blue line (#306998) plotting daily values over a 1-year period. The line shows an overall upward trend with seasonality and noise, starting around 148-150 in January and climbing to approximately 196 by December. The X-axis shows dates from January to December with weekly tick marks (Jan 6, Jan 13, etc.). The Y-axis shows values from approximately 144 to 200 with a "Value" label. Below the main chart, there is a navigator/overview panel showing the full data range with the current selection highlighted. A scrollbar is present beneath the navigator.

    The color scheme uses a blue primary color (#306998) with gray gridlines and white background. All text is readable, though the X-axis labels appear somewhat dense.
