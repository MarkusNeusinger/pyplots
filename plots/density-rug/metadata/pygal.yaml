review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data that showcases KDE curve shape with clear two-peak distribution
  - Good color scheme using Python colors (blue/yellow) with proper contrast
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart for continuous data with fill enabled
  - Semi-transparent fill under density curve as specified
  - Canvas sizing and font scaling appropriate for 4800x2700
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks are displayed as circular dots rather than traditional vertical tick
    marks along the x-axis
  - Rug marks positioned at y=0.04 instead of as classic rug mark style at y=0 with
    vertical lines
  - Y-axis shows normalized density rather than original density scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density-rug visualization with a bimodal
    KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) curve in Python blue (#306998) with semi-transparent
    fill. The curve shows two distinct modes: a smaller peak around value 35 and a
    larger peak around value 65. Below the density curve, yellow/gold (#FFD43B) dots
    represent the rug marks positioned at y=0.04, showing individual data point locations
    along the x-axis. The title "density-rug · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The x-axis is labeled "Value" and the y-axis "Density (normalized)" ranging
    from 0 to 1.1. A legend at the bottom identifies "KDE Density Curve" and "Rug
    Marks". Grid lines are visible with light grey coloring. The overall layout uses
    the 4800x2700 canvas effectively.'
