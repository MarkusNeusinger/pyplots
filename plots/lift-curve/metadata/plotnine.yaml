review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lift curve with correct mathematical calculation
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics (ggplot, geom_line, geom_point, geom_hline)
  - Good visual distinction with yellow-filled decile markers on blue line
  - Proper reference line at y=1 for random selection baseline
  - Well-documented code with realistic customer response scenario
  - Appropriate sizing for high-resolution output (16x9, 300 DPI)
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include (ratio) for clarity since lift is a unitless ratio
  - Could add text annotations at key decile points showing actual lift values
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve with a solid blue line (#306998)
    showing cumulative lift values on the Y-axis ranging from 0 to approximately 2.5,
    plotted against population targeted percentage (0-100%) on the X-axis. Yellow-filled
    circular markers with blue outlines appear at each decile point (10%, 20%, 30%,
    etc.). A gray dashed horizontal reference line at y=1.0 represents random selection
    (no lift). The curve starts high at approximately 2.5 when targeting the top 1-2%
    of the population, then gradually descends and approaches 1.0 as the percentage
    increases to 100%. The title "lift-curve · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top. The layout uses a minimal theme with clean white background and subtle
    grid lines.

          scale functions), but could use more advanced features like annotations
