review:
  strengths:
  - LOWESS curve is visually distinct from scatter points with good color contrast
    (blue vs yellow)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper use of statsmodels
    for LOWESS calculation
  - Custom pygal Style properly configured for large canvas with appropriate font
    sizes
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.6) for scatter points to show density
  - Appropriate LOWESS smoothing parameter (frac=0.35) within recommended range
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels in rendered output are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than the
    domain-specific labels defined in the code
  - Legend entries in output differ from code-defined labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with blue circular data points
    and a smooth yellow/gold LOWESS regression curve on a white background. The title
    reads "scatter-regression-lowess · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The X-axis
    is labeled "X Value" (ranging from 0 to 10) and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Value"
    (ranging from approximately -2 to 13). The legend at the bottom shows two entries:
    "Data Points" (blue) and "LOWESS Curve (frac=0.35)" (yellow). The LOWESS curve
    smoothly captures the non-linear trend in the data, starting low, rising gradually
    in the middle, dipping slightly around x=5, then rising steeply toward x=10. Grid
    lines are subtle and dotted.'

        comment: Title and axis labels are readable, tick labels are clear. Slightly

        comment: Labels are descriptive ("X Value", "Y Value") but lack units. The
          code specifies domain-specific labels which don't appear in the rendered
          output.

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate. Legend placement at bottom is functional
          but legend text could be clearer.

        comment: Uses pygal's XY chart, custom Style for fonts/colors, legend_at_bottom,
          stroke_style. Good use of pygal capabilities but could leverage more SVG
          interactivity features.
  verdict: APPROVED
