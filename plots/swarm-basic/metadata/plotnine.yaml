review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic clinical trial context that perfectly matches spec applications
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of stat_summary with median to add central tendency markers as suggested
    in spec
  - Appropriate color palette with custom manual colors distinguishing treatment groups
  - Well-sized figure (16x9) with properly scaled text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Uses position_jitter as approximation rather than true beeswarm algorithm (plotnine
    limitation, acceptable)
  - Medium Dose and Placebo colors (light blue and blue) are similar hues, reducing
    color accessibility
  - Some point overlap visible in denser groups like Medium Dose despite jittering
