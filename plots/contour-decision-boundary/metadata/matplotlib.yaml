review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of decision boundary visualization meeting all specification
    requirements
  - Clear visual distinction between correctly classified and misclassified points
    using different marker styles (circles vs X)
  - Proper use of contourf for class regions with appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4)
  - White decision boundary line provides clear separation between regions
  - Good marker sizing (s=150/200) and edge colors (white/black/red) for visibility
  - Reproducible with fixed random seeds
  weaknesses:
  - Grid is barely visible despite being enabled - could use slightly higher alpha
    or different styling
  - Color palette uses coolwarm which is not optimal for colorblind accessibility
    - consider using a perceptually uniform colormap
  - Could leverage SVM decision_function to show prediction confidence as gradient
    rather than hard boundary regions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a decision boundary visualization for a two-moon
    classification dataset. The canvas is divided into two colored regions: a light
    blue region (Class A prediction area) and a light coral/salmon region (Class B
    prediction area). A curved white line marks the decision boundary between classes.
    Training data points are overlaid as markers: blue solid circles for correctly
    classified Class A samples, yellow/gold circles with black edges for correctly
    classified Class B samples. Misclassified points from both classes are shown with
    red X markers. The title "contour-decision-boundary · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Axis labels show "Feature X1" and "Feature X2". A legend in
    the upper-left corner identifies all four marker types. The characteristic two-moon
    shape is clearly visible in the data distribution, with the SVM boundary curving
    appropriately to separate the interlocking crescents.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib's contourf and contour for decision regions and boundary
          line. Uses scatter with marker differentiation. However, could leverage
          more advanced features like decision_function for probability shading or
          support vector highlighting
  verdict: APPROVED
