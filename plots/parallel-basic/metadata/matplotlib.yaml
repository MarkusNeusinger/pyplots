review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of parallel coordinates from scratch using matplotlib
    primitives
  - Proper normalization to [0,1] range for fair comparison across dimensions
  - Clear color coding with colorblind-safe palette (Python blue, yellow, green)
  - Informative axis labels showing both dimension name and original value range
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.5) for overlapping lines
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper right overlaps some data lines; consider placing it
    outside the plot area or in a less obstructed corner
  - Line width of 2 could be increased to 2.5-3 for better visibility at full 4800x2700
    resolution
