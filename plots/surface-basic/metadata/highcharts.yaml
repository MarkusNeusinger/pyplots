review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts 3D module to simulate surface plot despite lack of
    native surface chart type
  - Good viridis colormap implementation with proper color interpolation
  - Well-structured wireframe approach with both X and Y direction lines creating
    mesh effect
  - Colorbar is properly implemented with clear height labels
  - Title follows exact spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (value_to_rgb) violating the KISS structure requirement
    of no functions
  - Axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis) instead of descriptive labels with context
  - The wireframe/scatter3d approach, while creative, creates a denser visual than
    a true surface would
