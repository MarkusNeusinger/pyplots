review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with sort=-x for automatic sorting
  - Horizontal orientation improves label readability (follows spec recommendation)
  - Clean professional appearance with subtle grid styling
  - Proper font sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700 target)
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips enhances usability
  - Rounded bar corners add visual polish
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling (dashed lines) is slightly more prominent than ideal; solid lines
    with lower opacity might be cleaner
