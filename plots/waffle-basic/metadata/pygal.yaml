review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with rounded corners on squares giving a polished look
  - Perfect color palette with good contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean legend placement with percentages clearly shown
  - Correctly implements the 10x10 grid where each square = 1%
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that matches spec applications
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging pygal SVG nature
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a custom class instead of KISS script structure (pygal lacks built-in waffle
    chart, so this is justified)
  - Slight horizontal whitespace imbalance - could use more of the canvas width
