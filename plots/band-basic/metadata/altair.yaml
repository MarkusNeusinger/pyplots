review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with mark_area and y/y2 encoding for
    the band
  - Clean layered composition combining band and line charts
  - Realistic uncertainty growth pattern (band widens over time) demonstrates practical
    use case
  - Proper 95% confidence interval calculation using 1.96 * uncertainty
  - Good visual hierarchy with semi-transparent band (opacity=0.3) and prominent center
    line (strokeWidth=4)
  - Correct output format with both PNG and HTML for Altair
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Signal Amplitude lacks units (should include units like mV)
  - No legend or annotation explaining what the band represents (e.g. 95% CI)
  image_description: The plot displays a band plot with a light blue semi-transparent
    confidence band between two boundary lines, with a solid dark blue central trend
    line running through the middle. The band shows a sinusoidal pattern with linear
    upward growth, with amplitude ranging from approximately -3 to 10 on the y-axis.
    The x-axis shows "Time (s)" from 0.0 to 10.0, and the y-axis shows "Signal Amplitude".
    The confidence band appropriately widens over time (from ~1.0 at t=0 to ~3.5 at
    t=10), demonstrating realistic uncertainty growth. The title "band-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The plot has a clean white background with
    subtle gray gridlines.
