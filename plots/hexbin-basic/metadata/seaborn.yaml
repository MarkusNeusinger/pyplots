review:
  strengths:
  - Clean hexagonal binning visualization with three distinct density clusters clearly
    visible
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Colorbar with Point Count label effectively communicates the density scale
  - Good use of 50,000 data points demonstrating hexbin advantage over scatter plots
  - Well-structured code with reproducible seed and clear data generation comments
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels show generic X Coordinate / Y Coordinate instead of contextual Longitude
    / Latitude as specified in the code
  - The JointGrid with marginal distributions does not appear in the final image
  - Grid settings are not visible in the output despite being set in the code
  - Relies on plt.hexbin rather than native seaborn hexbin function
