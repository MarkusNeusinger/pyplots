review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of aligned bins across all three distributions for accurate comparison
  - Proper semi-transparent fills (alpha 0.5) allowing overlapping regions to be clearly
    visible
  - Well-chosen contrasting colors (blue, yellow, green) for the three departments
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful variation between groups
  - Includes interactive tools and HTML export leveraging Bokeh strengths
  - Text sizes appropriately scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning leaves excessive whitespace on the right side of the plot
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
  - HoverTool could be customized to show bin range and count information
