review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's Densitymap for geographic density visualization
  - Clear visualization of multiple distinct hotspots with varying intensities
  - Appropriate transparency (0.7) allows basemap to show through
  - Well-configured colorbar with proper sizing and positioning
  - Includes both PNG and HTML exports as required for interactive library
  - Realistic San Francisco Bay Area scenario with plausible coordinates
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes descriptive prefix before the required format (minor)
  - Could add more interactive features like custom buttons or range sliders
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic heatmap of the San Francisco
    Bay Area showing activity density using Plotly''s Densitymap. Four distinct hotspots
    are visible: Downtown San Francisco (west side, intense red/dark), Oakland/Alameda
    area (center, strong red), Berkeley (upper center, moderate intensity), and South
    San Francisco (southwest, medium intensity). The background shows a light gray
    ''carto-positron'' basemap with city labels like San Rafael, Richmond, Concord,
    Daly City, San Mateo, Hayward, Fremont, and Livermore visible. The heatmap uses
    a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red) colorscale with transparency (0.7 opacity) allowing
    the basemap to show through. A vertical colorbar on the right displays the ''Intensity''
    scale from approximately 0.2 to 0.9. The title correctly follows the format ''Activity
    Density in SF Bay Area · heatmap-geographic · plotly · pyplots.ai''. Scattered
    background points with lower intensity are visible throughout the map.'
