review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature pattern with realistic daily variation demonstrates
    time series data well
  - Smart date formatting with monthly tick intervals prevents label overlap
  - High-resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts and line width
  - Correct title format and proper axis labels with units
  - Clean use of Highcharts datetime axis with millisecond timestamps
  - Subtitle adds context about the data
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area instead of highcharts_core.options.series.line
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like zooming capability or data
    grouping for large datasets
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing daily temperature
    readings throughout 2024. The chart has a white background with a clear title
    "line-timeseries · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top in bold, with a subtitle
    "Daily Temperature Readings - 2024" below it. The x-axis shows dates from Jan
    2024 to Jan 2025 with monthly tick intervals, labeled as "Date". The y-axis displays
    "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately -8 to 35 degrees. A single blue
    line (#306998) traces the temperature throughout the year, showing a clear sinusoidal
    seasonal pattern - cold winter temperatures around -6 to 5°C in January, rising
    through spring, peaking around 27-33°C in summer (June-August), then declining
    through autumn back to winter temperatures. The data shows realistic daily variation
    (noise) overlaid on the seasonal trend. Grid lines are subtle and visible on both
    axes. A legend at the bottom shows "Temperature" with a blue line indicator.
