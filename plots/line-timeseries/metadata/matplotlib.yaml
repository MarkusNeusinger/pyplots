review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib.dates module with MonthLocator and DateFormatter for
    intelligent date tick handling
  - Clean seasonal temperature simulation with realistic sinusoidal pattern and daily
    noise
  - Proper axis label rotation (45°) prevents overlap on date labels
  - Good visual hierarchy with major/minor grid lines at different alpha levels
  - Title follows the required pyplots.ai format perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Line could be slightly thicker (3.0 instead of 2.5) for better visibility at full
    resolution with 366 data points
