review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy dendrogram output to extract coordinates for Altair rendering
  - Clean two-color scheme distinguishing high vs low-level merges based on threshold
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labeling
  - Species cluster correctly demonstrating hierarchical relationships
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Minor empty space on right side of plot could be reduced
