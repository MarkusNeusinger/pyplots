review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation for category readability
  - Clear point estimates with distinct yellow markers and blue confidence interval
    bars
  - Reference line at 75 adds valuable context for interpretation
  - Good use of Highcharts columnrange for confidence intervals combined with scatter
    for points
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow)
  - Realistic business scenario with department performance scores
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence intervals lack endpoint caps as mentioned in specification notes
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area for better visual cohesion
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate chart showing department
    performance scores with 95% confidence intervals. Eight departments (Marketing,
    Engineering, Sales, Operations, Finance, HR, Research, Customer Support) are listed
    on the left y-axis. Each department has a yellow circular point marker representing
    the point estimate, with blue horizontal bars extending to show the confidence
    interval range. A vertical dashed gray reference line is positioned at score 75.
    The x-axis shows "Performance Score" ranging from 50 to 100. The title "point-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle explaining the data
    context. The layout uses white background with subtle gray grid lines. Engineering
    and Research show the highest scores (~85-88), while HR and Sales show lower scores
    (~66-68).

        comment: Good use of inverted chart, columnrange series for CIs, plotLines
