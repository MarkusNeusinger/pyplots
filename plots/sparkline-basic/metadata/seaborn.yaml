review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adherence to sparkline design principles with complete removal of chart
    chrome (axes, labels, gridlines)
  - 'Well-implemented optional features: min/max highlights with red/green dots, first/last
    points with yellow dots, subtle fill under line'
  - Good color choices with Python blue (#306998) and accessible highlight colors
  - Proper aspect ratio and canvas utilization for the 16:9 format
  - Clean, readable KISS-style code structure
  weaknesses:
  - The aspect ratio could be more compact (spec suggests 4:1 to 8:1 for sparklines,
    current is 16:9) but this works for standalone display
  - Library features score is moderate - implementation relies heavily on matplotlib
    underneath with sns.lineplot being a thin wrapper
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sparkline visualization on a light gray
    (#fafafa) background. A blue line (#306998) shows a time series trend over 24
    data points, starting low on the left, rising to a peak around the middle, then
    declining toward the right. The line has a subtle light blue fill underneath it
    creating an area effect. Four colored dots mark key points: yellow dots with blue
    borders mark the first and last data points, a green dot marks the maximum value
    (peak), and a red dot marks the minimum value. The title "sparkline-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. There are no axes, labels,
    gridlines, or tick marks - the visualization is pure and minimalist as expected
    for a sparkline.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot correctly, but this is basic seaborn usage; could
          leverage seaborn's statistical features more distinctively
