review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent date label handling using x_labels_major to show only first of each
    month, preventing clutter
  - Clean, realistic stock price simulation with trend and volatility that clearly
    demonstrates temporal patterns
  - Proper use of pygal Style class with appropriately scaled font sizes for the large
    canvas
  - 'Good layout decisions: no dots for dense data, legend at bottom, rotated labels'
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could be shown on both axes as recommended in spec (currently only Y-axis
    guides shown)
  - Stroke width of 5 works but could be slightly thicker (e.g., 6-8) for better visibility
    at full resolution
  - HTML output could leverage pygal interactivity features (tooltips, hover effects)
    more explicitly
