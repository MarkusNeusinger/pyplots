review:
  strengths:
  - All three MACD components (MACD line, signal line, histogram) clearly displayed
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - MACD parameters (12, 26, 9) clearly noted in annotation box
  - Zero reference line included for crossover visualization
  - Good color contrast between MACD (blue) and signal (yellow) lines
  - Rotated x-axis labels prevent overlap
  - Clean, publication-ready appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red histogram colors are not colorblind-safe (consider using viridis or
    colorblind-safe alternatives)
  - Histogram drawn with matplotlib loop instead of seaborn native bar plotting
  - Legend does not include histogram entry
  - Axis labels lack units
  image_description: 'The plot displays a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    technical indicator chart spanning from February 2024 to June 2024. The chart
    shows a blue MACD line representing the difference between 12-day and 26-day EMAs,
    ranging from approximately -2.3 to +1.2. A yellow/gold signal line represents
    the 9-day EMA of the MACD. Vertical histogram bars show the difference between
    MACD and signal lines - green for positive values, red for negative values, with
    alpha transparency. A gray dashed horizontal zero reference line is included.
    The title reads "indicator-macd · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis
    shows "Date" with rotated labels, and the y-axis shows "MACD Value". A legend
    in the upper left identifies "MACD (12, 26)" and "Signal (9)". A parameter annotation
    box in the lower right displays "MACD Parameters: 12, 26, 9". Subtle dashed grid
    lines with alpha 0.3 provide reference.'
