review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS structure with no functions or classes
  - Excellent use of fill_between for confidence band with appropriate alpha transparency
  - Realistic temperature forecast scenario with widening uncertainty over time
  - Well-formatted title following the required spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  - Good legend placement and clear labeling of both central line and confidence interval
  weaknesses:
  - Could use contrasting colors for line vs band as suggested in spec (e.g., dark
    blue line with lighter blue band - currently same color)
  image_description: The plot displays a 30-day temperature forecast with a confidence
    interval. A dark blue solid line (labeled "Forecast Mean") shows the central temperature
    trend, ranging from approximately 16°C to 23°C over 30 days with an overall upward
    trend and sinusoidal variation. A semi-transparent light blue shaded band (labeled
    "95% Confidence Interval") surrounds the central line, widening progressively
    as days increase to reflect growing forecast uncertainty. The title "line-confidence
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis is labeled "Days Ahead"
    (1-30), Y-axis is labeled "Temperature (°C)" (approximately 14-29). A legend in
    the upper left corner identifies both elements. A subtle dashed grid aids readability.
