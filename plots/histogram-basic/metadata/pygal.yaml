review:
  strengths:
  - Correct use of pygal.Histogram with proper (count, start, end) tuple format —
    idiomatic pygal pattern
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean, realistic exam score scenario with appropriate data generation (normal
    + exponential skew)
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Good bin count (20) that reveals distribution shape without noise
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels include students suffix (via value_formatter) which is redundant
    with the Number of Students y-axis title — creates visual clutter and wastes horizontal
    space
  - 'No data storytelling: no annotations for mean, median, or distribution shape;
    no callouts highlighting the slight right skew'
  - No visual refinement beyond basic configuration — could benefit from bar edge
    styling, more polished grid, or other design touches
  - Does not leverage pygal distinctive SVG/interactive features in a way that translates
    to PNG output
  - 'The foreground_subtle is set to #ddd which is very light — while this makes subtle
    guides, the styling overall remains very default-looking'
  image_description: The plot displays a basic histogram showing exam score distribution
    for 500 students using 20 bins. Bars are rendered in a muted steel-blue (#306998)
    on a white background. The title "histogram-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top in a dark gray font. The x-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)"
    with tick marks at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. The y-axis is labeled "Number
    of Students" with tick values formatted as "N students" (0 through 60). The distribution
    is roughly normal, centered around 70, with a slight right skew — the tallest
    bar reaches approximately 63 students in the 70-73 range. Bars span from about
    35 to 100, with clear edges and no gaps between adjacent bins. The chart fills
    the canvas well, with balanced margins. Horizontal dotted guide lines appear on
    the y-axis. No legend is shown (appropriate for a single series).
