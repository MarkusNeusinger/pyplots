review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highstock for synchronized dual-pane layout
  - Proper 70%/25% vertical split between price and volume panes as specified
  - Volume bars correctly color-matched to candlestick direction
  - Crosshair configured for precise price/volume reading across both panes
  - Realistic stock data generation with proper gap handling and volatility modeling
  - Clean title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-configured axis formatting ($ prefix for prices, M suffix for volumes)
  weaknesses:
  - Blue/red color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue/orange instead)
  - X-axis date labels appear clipped/truncated at bottom of image
  image_description: The plot displays a professional stock candlestick chart with
    a synchronized volume pane below. The upper pane (approximately 70% of height)
    shows OHLC candlesticks over 60 trading days, with blue candles representing bullish
    (up) days and red candles representing bearish (down) days. Price ranges from
    approximately $118 to $170, showing an overall downtrend. The lower pane (approximately
    25% of height) displays volume bars in matching colors - blue for up days and
    red for down days. Volumes range from about 2M to 10M units. The title "candlestick-volume
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Y-axis labels show "Price (USD)"
    and "Volume" with proper formatting ($XXX and X.XM). X-axis shows date labels
    (day numbers). Grid lines are subtle gray. A crosshair is configured for precise
    reading.
