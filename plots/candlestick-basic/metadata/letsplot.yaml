review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent candlestick implementation using geom_segment for wicks and geom_rect
    for bodies
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good visual clarity with appropriately sized elements and well-spaced date labels
  - Realistic stock price simulation with random walk algorithm
  - Correct title format and proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme may cause issues for colorblind users; consider using blue/orange
    or adding patterns
  - X-axis label Date could be more descriptive (e.g., Trading Date or include year)
  - Grid only shows horizontal lines; subtle vertical gridlines at date markers could
    help readability
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 trading days
    of stock price data from January 2 to February 6. Green candlesticks represent
    bullish days (close > open) and red candlesticks represent bearish days (close
    < open). Each candlestick has a rectangular body showing the open-close range
    and thin gray wicks extending to show the high-low range. The y-axis shows "Price
    ($)" ranging from approximately 93 to 112, and the x-axis shows "Date" with labels
    at Jan 02, Jan 09, Jan 16, Jan 23, Jan 30, and Feb 06. The title reads "candlestick-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The chart uses a minimal theme with subtle horizontal
    grid lines and no vertical grid lines. The overall trend shows an initial rise
    followed by a decline.
