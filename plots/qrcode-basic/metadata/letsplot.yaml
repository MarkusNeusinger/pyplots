review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_tile for QR code matrix visualization
  - Clean theming that removes all axes, grids, and backgrounds for a pure QR display
  - Proper quiet zone implementation through QRCode border parameter
  - High contrast black/white color scheme ensures scannability
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Saves both PNG and HTML when only PNG is required for static visualization
  - Could use coord_fixed() to guarantee 1:1 aspect ratio
  image_description: The plot displays a well-formed QR code rendered using lets-plot's
    geom_tile function. The QR code appears as a square matrix of black (#000000)
    and white (#FFFFFF) tiles on a clean white background. Three characteristic finder
    patterns (square-in-square position detection markers) are clearly visible in
    the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left corners. The title "qrcode-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in gray text. The QR code has an adequate
    quiet zone (white border) around it for reliable scanning. The encoded content
    is "https://pyplots.ai" with error correction level M. The overall layout is balanced
    with the QR code well-centered in the 3600×3600 square canvas.
