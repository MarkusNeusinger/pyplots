review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent radar chart construction using polar-to-cartesian coordinate transformation
  - 'Proper layering of geoms: gridlines → spokes → polygons → lines → points → labels'
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.2) for overlapping polygon fills with thicker
    outlines
  - Clean data organization with pandas DataFrames for each visual component
  - Appropriate 1:1 square aspect ratio for symmetric radar chart
  - Realistic smartphone comparison scenario with meaningful attributes
  weaknesses:
  - Grid value labels could be larger for better readability at scale
  - Category axis labels could include units (e.g., Score 0-100) for clarity
  - Color palette includes red-green which may not be ideal for all colorblind users
