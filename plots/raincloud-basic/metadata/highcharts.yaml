review:
  strengths:
  - Code architecture is well-organized with clear sections for KDE clouds, box plots,
    and rain scatter
  - 'Correct raincloud metaphor: clouds above (negative offset), rain below (positive
    offset) in inverted chart logic'
  - 'Good data generation: 4 experimental conditions with different distribution shapes
    (normal, bimodal, high-variance)'
  - Title format and legend configuration are properly set up in the code
  - Uses appropriate Highcharts series types (PolygonSeries for KDE, BoxPlotSeries,
    ScatterSeries)
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Chart renders blank — The entire visualization fails to display. The
    4800x2561 output is essentially empty (42KB, >99% white pixels). Only a thin line
    at the bottom is visible'
  - The inverted chart with PolygonSeries coordinates likely causes the data to render
    outside the visible viewport — the polygon x-coordinates (category indices with
    fractional offsets like -0.4 to 0.25) may not map correctly to the inverted axis
    system
  - The x-axis uses string categories but polygon/scatter data uses numeric x-coordinates
    — this axis type mismatch may be the root cause of the blank render. Consider
    using numeric x-axis with manual category labels instead
  - The chart height is set to 2700 but screenshot is 2561 — dimension mismatch suggests
    viewport/rendering issues
  - Manual KDE implementation is verbose; verify whether Highcharts PolygonSeries
    can properly render these shapes in an inverted coordinate system
  image_description: The plot image is essentially blank/empty. The 4800x2561 PNG
    is only 42KB (expected ~35MB uncompressed for a full chart), confirming near-total
    whitespace. The only visible element is a thin horizontal gray line near the very
    bottom of the canvas. No title, no axis labels, no category names, no violin/KDE
    shapes, no box plots, no scatter points, and no legend are visible. The Highcharts
    chart has completely failed to render its content into the visible viewport area.
    The intended visualization was a horizontal raincloud plot with 4 experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) showing reaction time
    distributions via half-violin KDE clouds, box plots, and jittered scatter rain
    points.

        comment: Cannot evaluate since nothing renders; the approach of combining
          multiple series types is library-appropriate but broken
