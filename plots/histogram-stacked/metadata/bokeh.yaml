quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean stacking implementation with proper bottom/top calculations
  - White line separators between segments improve readability
  - Realistic educational scenario with meaningful group differences
  - Proper use of consistent bin edges across all groups
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two blue colors (dark #306998 and light #4B8BBE) may cause confusion for colorblind
    users; consider using more distinct hues'
  - Does not use ColumnDataSource which is idiomatic Bokeh practice
  - Some test scores exceed 100 points which is atypical for standard tests
