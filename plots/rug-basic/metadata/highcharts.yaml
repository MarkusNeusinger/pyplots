review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with clean, uncluttered design - removed grid lines for
    cleaner rug plot appearance
  - Perfect title format and informative subtitle with units
  - Great data story showing three response time clusters plus outliers - demonstrates
    the value of rug plots
  - 'Smart use of tight y-axis bounds (max: 1.2) to maximize vertical space utilization'
  - Appropriate transparency (0.6 alpha) to show overlapping tick marks
  - 'Colorblind-safe color choice (Python blue #306998)'
  weaknesses:
  - Rug tick marks extend nearly full height of plot area; traditional rug plots have
    much shorter ticks positioned at the axis edge
  - The tick line width (5px) is adequate but could be slightly bolder for better
    visibility of sparse outliers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic rug plot showing API response times
    in milliseconds. The visualization consists of vertical blue lines (tick marks)
    arranged along the x-axis from 0 to 600ms. There are three distinct clusters of
    tick marks: a dense cluster around 50ms (fast responses), another cluster around
    100-150ms (medium responses), and a sparser cluster around 250ms (slow responses).
    Three isolated outlier ticks appear at approximately 380ms, 420ms, and 510ms.
    The title "rug-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with
    a subtitle "API Response Times (ms)" below it. The x-axis is labeled "Response
    Time (ms)" with tick marks at 50ms intervals. The tick marks use a semi-transparent
    blue color (#306998 with 0.6 alpha), and no y-axis labels or grid lines are shown,
    creating a clean, focused visualization.'

        comment: Uses LineSeries to create vertical tick marks; creative solution
          for Highcharts which lacks native rug plot support. Uses Selenium for PNG
          export as required. Could leverage more Highcharts features like animation
          or hover states.
  verdict: APPROVED
