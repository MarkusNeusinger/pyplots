review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of manual KDE calculation using Silverman's rule for
    bandwidth selection
  - Beautiful color gradient that semantically represents temperature (cold=blue,
    warm=yellow/orange)
  - Clean chronological ordering with January at bottom, December at top (reversed
    for visual stacking)
  - Proper use of Plotly's fill="toself" for creating solid density regions
  - Custom hover templates provide good interactivity showing month and temperature
  - Well-tuned overlap parameter (50%) matches spec recommendation
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining the color scale (cold→warm color mapping)
  - HTML output is generated but not strictly required for review
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ridgeline visualization of monthly temperature
    distributions. There are 12 vertically stacked density curves, one for each month
    from January (bottom) to December (top). The color scheme transitions from deep
    blue (Python Blue #306998) for winter months (January, February, December) through
    lighter blues for transitional months, to warm yellow (#FFD43B) for June and orange/coral
    tones for May, July, and August. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from
    -10 to 40, with clear tick marks. Month names are displayed on the y-axis as labels.
    The title "ridgeline-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Each
    density curve shows smooth Gaussian-like distributions with appropriate overlap
    (~50%), creating the characteristic ridge mountain appearance.'
