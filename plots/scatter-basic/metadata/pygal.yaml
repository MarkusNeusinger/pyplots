  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Strong data storytelling through the trend line with correlation coefficient and
    deliberate outliers that showcase scatter diversity
  - Professional visual design with custom Style, subtle grid lines, and carefully
    chosen color palette
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features present (transparency, grid,
    labels, title format)
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) with appropriate data
    ranges
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Dot size slightly large for 120 points, causing minor visual clustering in dense
    regions
  - Some unused/contradictory chart options (dynamic_print_values=True alongside print_values=False)
  - Could benefit from explicit text annotations highlighting specific outliers or
    the correlation insight
  - Axis range extends slightly beyond the data range, creating minor whitespace at
    extremes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart titled "scatter-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" showing the relationship between Study Hours per Week (hrs) on the
    x-axis (range 1–15) and Exam Score (%) on the y-axis (range 10%–100%). There are
    120 blue (#306998) circular data points representing individual students, with
    moderate transparency (opacity ~0.65) that reveals overlapping areas. A dashed
    pink/red (#d64541) trend line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right,
    indicating a strong positive correlation (r = 0.86). The background is white with
    a light gray (#f7f7f7) plot area and subtle dotted grid lines. The legend is positioned
    at the bottom with two entries: "Students (n=120)" and "Trend (r = 0.86)". Several
    deliberate outliers are visible — notably a point near (3, 82%) and one near (7,
    95%) representing high performers with low study hours, and points near (12.5,
    42%) representing low performers despite high study hours. All text is clearly
    readable with explicitly set font sizes.'
