review:
  strengths:
  - Effective Archimedean spiral algorithm for word placement with collision detection
  - Good use of semantic coloring to indicate frequency ranges (blue for high, yellow
    for low)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Interactive hover tooltips in HTML output showing word and frequency values
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - No overlapping words - collision detection works well
  weaknesses:
  - Word cloud fills only ~35-40% of canvas, leaving excessive whitespace (VQ-05 issue)
  - Rotation feature mentioned in spec notes is partially implemented but high-frequency
    words forced horizontal
  - Smallest words (freq < 20) are quite small and harder to read at normal viewing
    distance
