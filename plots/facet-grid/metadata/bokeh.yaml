review:
  strengths:
  - Well-organized 4×3 grid layout that clearly shows patterns across regions and
    seasons
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue/orange/teal)
  - Good text sizing throughout - all labels are clearly readable
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation in the data
  - Clean, reproducible code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - HTML-based legend (Div element) does not render in PNG export - only small colored
    artifacts appear in subplot corners
  - No use of Bokeh distinctive interactive features (hover tooltips, linked brushing,
    pan/zoom tools)
