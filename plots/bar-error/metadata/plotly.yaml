review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly styled error bars with
    visible caps
  - Perfect spec compliance including the required annotation explaining error bar
    meaning
  - Realistic lab experiment context that demonstrates the practical use case
  - Clean KISS code structure following all conventions
  - Asymmetric error bars correctly implemented showing realistic experimental variation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled (showlegend=False) - while the annotation works, a legend entry
    would be more standard
  - Could leverage Plotly hover templates to show exact values and error ranges on
    interaction
  - Error magnitude variation across groups is relatively uniform - more dramatic
    differences would better showcase the feature
