review:
  strengths:
  - Correct ECDF implementation with step=left creating proper vertical jumps at each
    data point
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle dashed grid lines
  - Proper Y-axis range from 0 to 1 as required for cumulative proportion
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Follows library-specific guidelines for Selenium-based PNG export
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at bottom center could be repositioned to avoid overlap with
    x-axis label
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Value (units) would be more descriptive)
  - Data uses a simple normal distribution; a slightly more interesting distribution
    would better demonstrate ECDF capabilities
