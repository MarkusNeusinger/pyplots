review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme (red-blue) centered at zero for intuitive correlation
    interpretation
  - All correlation values clearly annotated with 2 decimal places and smart text
    color contrast (white on dark, black on light)
  - Good use of realistic financial metrics data that shows varied correlation patterns
    (positive, negative, near-zero)
  - Clean square layout with well-sized cells and proper variable ordering on both
    axes
  - 'Title follows required format exactly: heatmap-correlation · altair · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels are rotated at -45 degrees which works but could be slightly harder
    to read than horizontal or vertical
  - Colorbar could be slightly larger for better visibility
