review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the ghost effect to suggest real-time motion/transition
  - Clean color-coded change indicators (green/red) with appropriate contrast
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern for data organization
  - Realistic service monitoring context with plausible data values
  - Proper title format and well-sized text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Change indicator text could be slightly larger for better visibility
  - HTML output could include HoverTool for interactive tooltips
  - Grid styling could include minor tick marks for better value reading
  image_description: The plot displays a real-time updating bar chart showing "Active
    Connections" for 6 service categories (API Gateway, Auth Service, Database, Cache,
    Storage, Queue). The visualization uses Python Blue (#306998) as the primary color
    with solid bars representing current values and lighter ghosted bars (alpha ~0.25)
    behind them showing previous values to suggest motion/transition. Each bar has
    a value label (e.g., 847, 623, 512, 891, 445, 678) and a change indicator above
    it in green for positive changes (+31, +84, +45, +69) or red for negative changes
    (-35, -26). The title "bar-realtime · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.
    X-axis labels are slightly rotated. The background is light gray (#FAFAFA) with
    dashed horizontal grid lines. The layout is well-balanced with good use of canvas
    space.
