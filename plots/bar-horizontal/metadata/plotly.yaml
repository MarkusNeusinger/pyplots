review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Data scenario (programming language survey) is highly relatable and realistic
  - Proper use of Plotly go.Bar with horizontal orientation and text positioning
  - Clean code following KISS principles
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactivity
  - Bars sorted descending for easy comparison as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Value label font size (32) could be slightly reduced as it appears close to bar
    ends
  - X-axis range padding (1.15x max) creates extra whitespace on right side
