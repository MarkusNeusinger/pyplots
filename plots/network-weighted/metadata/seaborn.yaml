review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed spring layout algorithm creating natural
    node clustering
  - Clear visual hierarchy with edge thickness and color both encoding weight
  - Comprehensive legends explaining both node size and edge weight meaning
  - Realistic and engaging trade network data with 15 countries and 30 trade relationships
  - Good use of seaborn color palettes (Set2 for nodes, Blues for edges)
  - Node sizing by weighted degree adds meaningful information beyond the specification
    minimum
  - Title format correctly follows the required pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Label font size (13pt) is slightly below the recommended 16pt+ for tick labels
  - The implementation relies heavily on matplotlib primitives (LineCollection, scatter)
    with seaborn used primarily for styling rather than core plotting functions
  - The inline spring layout algorithm, while functional, adds 30+ lines of complexity
    that could be avoided with networkx
  image_description: The plot displays a weighted network graph showing international
    trade relationships between 15 countries. Nodes are represented as colored circles
    with varying sizes based on total trade volume (weighted degree). The USA and
    China appear as the largest nodes, positioned centrally, indicating their high
    trade connectivity. Edges between nodes have varying thickness representing trade
    volume in billions USD - thicker edges (darker blue) indicate stronger trade relationships
    such as USA-Canada, USA-Mexico, USA-China, and China-Japan. Node colors use the
    seaborn Set2 palette with each country having a distinct pastel color. Labels
    are placed above each node in bold dark text. A vertical colorbar on the right
    shows the trade volume scale (20-620 billion USD) using a Blues colormap. A legend
    in the upper left explains node size interpretation (Lower/Medium/Higher total
    trade). The title follows the correct format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai.
    The layout uses a force-directed spring algorithm placing highly connected nodes
    centrally.
