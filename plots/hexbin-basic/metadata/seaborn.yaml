review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density visualization
  - Good dataset size (50,000 points) demonstrating hexbin advantage over scatter
    plots
  - Clean code structure with realistic GPS coordinate scenario for urban analytics
  - Appropriate gridsize (35) providing good balance between detail and readability
  - Colorbar clearly labeled with appropriate font sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels show generic X/Y Coordinate instead of Longitude/Latitude matching
    the data context
  - Marginal distributions from JointGrid not visible in final output, reducing seaborn-distinctive
    value
  - Consider log scale for colormap when density varies widely as spec suggests
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization with three
    distinct density clusters on a white background. The hexagons are colored using
    the viridis colormap (dark purple to yellow), with the brightest yellow hexagons
    indicating the highest point density (~70 counts). The X-axis is labeled "X Coordinate"
    (range -2 to 8), and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Coordinate" (range -2 to 8). A vertical
    colorbar on the right shows "Point Count" ranging from ~5 to 70. The title "hexbin-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Three cluster centers are visible:
    one around (2, 2), one around (6, 6), and one around (4-5, 5-6). The layout is
    clean with subtle grid lines.'
