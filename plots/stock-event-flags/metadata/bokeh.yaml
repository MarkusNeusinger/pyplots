review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with datetime
    formatting, interactive Legend'
  - Clean alternating flag positioning that prevents visual clutter
  - Distinct markers and colors for each event type (triangle, circle, square, diamond)
  - Proper vertical dashed connector lines from flags to price level
  - Exports both PNG and interactive HTML
  weaknesses:
  - Event label font size (14pt) could be larger for better readability on 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Minor duplicate legend issue (appears on both sides of plot)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price line chart spanning from January
    2024 to September 2024. The price line is rendered in Python Blue (#306998) showing
    realistic stock movement starting around $150, declining to ~$125 in mid-year,
    then recovering. Seven event flags are positioned at various points along the
    timeline with dashed vertical connector lines to the price level. Event markers
    use distinct shapes and colors: blue triangles for earnings (Q4 Earnings, Q1 Earnings),
    green circles for dividends (Dividend $0.50, Dividend $0.55), purple square for
    split (2:1 Split), and yellow diamonds for news (Product Launch, Partnership).
    Flags alternate above and below the price line to avoid overlapping. The title
    correctly follows the format "stock-event-flags · bokeh · pyplots.ai". A legend
    appears in the top-left corner showing all event types. The layout uses a light
    gray background (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines.'
