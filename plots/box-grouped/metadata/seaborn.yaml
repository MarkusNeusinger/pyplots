review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic department/experience level scenario
    showing meaningful variation
  - Proper use of seaborn hue parameter for grouping with custom color palette
  - Good visual hierarchy with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean separation of boxes within each category with consistent widths
  - Outliers are clearly visible and add to the data story
  weaknesses:
  - 'The two blue colors (Junior #306998 and Senior #4B8BBE) are somewhat similar
    and could be more distinct for colorblind accessibility'
  - Axis labels lack units (though Performance Score is inherently unitless, could
    add 0-100 for clarity)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot with 4 departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Support) on the x-axis and Performance Score (20-100) on the
    y-axis. Each department has 3 side-by-side boxes representing experience levels:
    Junior (dark blue #306998), Mid-Level (gold/yellow #FFD43B), and Senior (light
    blue #4B8BBE). The boxes show clear median lines, quartile boundaries, whiskers
    extending to ~1.5×IQR, and several outliers displayed as small circles. The title
    "box-grouped · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. A legend
    in the upper right identifies the three experience levels. The plot uses a white
    background with subtle horizontal grid lines.'
