review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with geom_bin2d
  - Appropriate bin count (40) provides good resolution for the 5000-point dataset
  - Text sizing follows the library guidelines perfectly (24pt title, 20pt axis, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Correlation pattern in the bivariate normal data is clearly visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than context-specific; could
    use a realistic scenario like Asset Returns vs Index Returns
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha) for a cleaner appearance
