review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent physics-based circle packing algorithm with 350 iterations ensuring
    no overlap
  - Area-proportional sizing using sqrt scaling for accurate visual perception
  - Clean, colorblind-safe palette with logical grouping by department function
  - Smart label placement - only shows labels in circles large enough to fit them
  - Professional title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic department budget data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a color legend explaining the groupings (Tech, Support, Business, Compliance)
  - Some smaller bubbles (Legal, Security) are unlabeled and their departments are
    unclear without a legend
  - Customer Support bubble is not visible in the visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart representing "Department
    Budget Allocation" with 15 circular bubbles of varying sizes. The largest bubbles
    are Engineering ($850K), R&D ($750K), Sales ($680K), and Product ($550K). The
    bubbles are color-coded into four groups: blue (Tech: Engineering, Sales, IT,
    Product), yellow (Business/Creative: Marketing, R&D, Design, Data Science), teal
    (Support: Operations, HR, Finance, Customer Support), and sage green (Compliance/Quality:
    Legal, Security, QA). Larger bubbles display department names in bold white text
    with values below. The bubbles are tightly packed without overlapping, demonstrating
    the physics simulation. The title reads "Department Budget Allocation · bubble-packed
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. The background is white with axes
    turned off for a clean visualization.'
