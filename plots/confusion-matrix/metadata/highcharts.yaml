review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and cell annotations
  - Sequential blue colormap is colorblind-accessible and effectively shows magnitude
  - Proper confusion matrix orientation with True Labels on y-axis and Predicted Labels
    on x-axis
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: custom tooltip showing correct/misclassified
    status, color axis with gradient stops'
  - White cell borders provide clean visual separation
  - Realistic 4-class classification scenario with believable misclassification patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could better utilize the square canvas - some wasted space around edges
  - np.random.seed(42) is set but data is entirely hardcoded, making the seed unnecessary
  - Colorbar scale goes to 100 but max value is 87, slightly misleading range
