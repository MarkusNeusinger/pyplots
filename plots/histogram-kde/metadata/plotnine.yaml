review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of after_stat("density") for proper histogram-KDE scaling
  - Realistic financial data simulation with multiple market regimes (normal, volatile,
    low-volatility periods)
  - Perfect color contrast between blue histogram and yellow KDE curve
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper layering
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are nearly invisible (panel_grid_major alpha=0.3 combined with light
    color makes them hard to see)
  image_description: The plot shows a histogram with KDE overlay visualizing stock
    daily returns. The histogram bars are a semi-transparent steel blue (#306998)
    with darker blue borders, allowing the bright yellow (#FFD43B) KDE curve to be
    clearly visible overlaid on top. The distribution is centered around 0% with a
    slight negative skew and fat tails extending from approximately -10% to +7%. The
    x-axis is labeled "Daily Return (%)" and the y-axis shows "Density" ranging from
    0.0 to 0.3. The title "histogram-kde · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    The layout uses a minimal theme with a clean white background and very subtle
    grid lines.
