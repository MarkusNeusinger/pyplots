review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical (axvspan for recession period) and horizontal
    (axhspan for risk zone) spans in a single plot
  - Highly realistic and recognizable scenario using 2008 financial crisis as context
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Perfect use of matplotlib native span functions (axvspan, axhspan) with appropriate
    alpha transparency
  - Text sizing follows library guidelines exactly (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Good color contrast between blue line, yellow vertical span, and red horizontal
    span
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper left slightly overlaps with the beginning of the stock
    price line data
