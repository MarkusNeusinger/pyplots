review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of gggrid() to create vertically stacked decomposition panels
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette with distinct colors for each component
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for actual decomposition
  - Good realistic temperature scenario with clear seasonal patterns
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Properly handles NaN values from decomposition by using dropna()
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle and barely visible - could increase alpha for better
    readability
  - File handling requires moving files from lets-plot-images subdirectory (workaround
    needed)
