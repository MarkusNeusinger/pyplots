review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex visualization type (clustered heatmap) that
    pygal does not natively support
  - Colorblind-safe diverging colormap (Purple-Green from ColorBrewer)
  - Both row and column dendrograms with proper hierarchical clustering using Ward
    method
  - Biologically meaningful gene expression data with clear tumor vs normal sample
    grouping
  - Proper reordering of rows and columns based on clustering results
  - HTML output with embedded SVG for interactivity
  - Good text legibility with 45-degree rotation for column labels
  weaknesses:
  - Custom class structure deviates from KISS principle though necessary for this
    complex plot type in pygal
  - Colorbar Z-Score label could be more descriptive such as Expression Z-Score
  - Dendrograms could be slightly more prominent or thicker for better visibility
