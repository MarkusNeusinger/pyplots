review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes and line widths for high-resolution
    output
  - Proper lift curve calculation methodology with clear documentation in comments
  - Good use of decile markers with lift value annotations to highlight key insights
  - Reference baseline at y=1 clearly distinguishes model performance from random
    selection
  - Realistic marketing campaign scenario with appropriate 10% base response rate
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is used minimally - only for sns.lineplot and theming; the core visualization
    could be done entirely in matplotlib
  - First decile annotation appears slightly cramped near the top of the curve
  - Y-axis label could clarify that lift is a ratio
