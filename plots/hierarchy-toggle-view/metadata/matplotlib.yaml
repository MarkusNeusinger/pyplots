review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with consistent colors across both views
  - Creative use of matplotlib pie chart with width parameter to create sunburst rings
  - Clean KISS-style code structure with well-organized sections
  - Realistic organizational structure data demonstrating the visualization purpose
  - Proper use of FancyBboxPatch for visually appealing rounded rectangles in treemap
  - Adaptive text color (white on dark backgrounds, black on light)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing the interactive toggle control specified in the spec - shows static side-by-side
    comparison instead
  - Operations label is truncated in the sunburst inner ring
  - Some outer ring labels in sunburst could be slightly larger for better readability
  - No animation/transition capability (spec mentions smooth animated transitions)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a side-by-side comparison of two hierarchical
    visualization methods for company department data. On the left is a Treemap View
    with nested rectangles representing 4 main departments (Engineering in Python
    blue #306998, Sales in yellow #FFD43B, Operations in sea green #2E8B57, and HR
    in burnt orange #E07B39) and their sub-departments. Each rectangle shows the department
    name and value in parentheses, with area proportional to value. On the right is
    a Sunburst View showing the same data as concentric rings - the inner ring displays
    the 4 main departments, while the outer ring shows 13 sub-departments in matching
    colors. Both views share a horizontal legend at the bottom with 4 color-coded
    department labels. The main title "hierarchy-toggle-view · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in large bold text.'
