review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean data labels positioned on top of each bar for easy reading
  - Appropriate single-color scheme that is colorblind-safe
  - Realistic retail sales scenario with meaningful category names
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of Highcharts configuration options (borderRadius, pointPadding, marginBottom)
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid lines are slightly too prominent (gridLineWidth: 1 with #e0e0e0 could be
    more subtle)'
  - Uses raw dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python library classes
  - Bar height variation could be more pronounced to better demonstrate ranking differences
