review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of conditional text colors (white on dark cells, dark gray on light)
    for optimal readability across all intensity levels
  - Hand-crafted diverging palette with smooth blue to white to red progression, well-calibrated
    symmetric range
  - Clean removal of all chart chrome (grid, axis lines, outline) with white cell
    borders creating a polished, modern look
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML with HoverTool) leverages Bokeh interactive strengths
  - Data tells a coherent geographic/seasonal story without requiring annotations
  - construct_color_bar from renderer is idiomatic modern Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Color bar title Anomaly (°C) is slightly cramped at the right edge — could benefit
    from more right margin or repositioning
  - Blue-red diverging palette could be replaced with a more colorblind-safe alternative
    (e.g., blue-orange or a perceptually uniform diverging scheme)
  - Only 10 months shown (Jan-Oct) instead of full 12 — the data would be more complete
    with all months
  image_description: The plot displays a heatmap of monthly temperature anomalies
    (°C) for 7 cities (Oslo, Berlin, Madrid, Cairo, Mumbai, Tokyo, Sydney) across
    10 months (Jan–Oct 2024). A hand-crafted diverging blue-to-red color palette maps
    negative anomalies (blue/cool) to positive anomalies (red/warm), centered on white
    at zero. Each cell contains a value annotation with +/- sign, using conditional
    text colors — white text on dark cells and dark gray text on light cells for readability.
    A vertical color bar on the right shows the "Anomaly (°C)" scale from -2.5 to
    2.5. The title reads "heatmap-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top left. The
    x-axis is labeled "Month (2024)" and the y-axis "City". Grid lines, axis lines,
    and outlines are removed. White borders separate cells. The background is a subtle
    off-white (#fafafa) with white plot borders. Northern cities (Oslo, Berlin) show
    clear cold-winter/warm-summer seasonal patterns in blue-to-red, while Sydney shows
    a reversed Southern Hemisphere pattern. Mumbai shows consistently warm anomalies.

        passed: false
        comment: Blue-red diverging palette is standard but not one of the recommended
          colorblind-safe palettes. Works for most colorblind types but deuteranopia
          could find subtle mid-range values harder to differentiate.

          slightly cramped at right edge.
