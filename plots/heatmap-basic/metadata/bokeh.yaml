review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Smart adaptive text colors (white on dark, black on light cells) for optimal readability
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and all spec requirements met
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output leveraging Bokeh interactivity capability
  - Well-sized text elements for 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include more context (e.g., Month 2024 or Product Category)
  - Could add HoverTool for enhanced interactivity in HTML version
  - Random data does not show clear patterns/clusters typical in real sales data
