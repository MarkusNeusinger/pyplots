review:
  strengths:
  - Clean four-panel layout with well-differentiated components using distinct colors
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for authentic time series decomposition
  - 'Title follows required format exactly: timeseries-decomposition · plotly · pyplots.ai'
  - Excellent use of Plotly subplots with shared x-axes for time alignment
  - Realistic airline passenger data scenario with clear trend and seasonality
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label for Original subplot says Passengers (thousands) but other subplots
    lack units context
  - Trend subplot y-axis label just says Trend without indicating the unit is still
    passengers
