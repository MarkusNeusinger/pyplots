review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept with proper radial axis arrangement
    at 120-degree intervals
  - Beautiful curved bezier edges through center point create visually appealing connections
  - Good color scheme using Python blue, yellow, and teal that is accessible and distinctive
  - Realistic software module dependency example that exactly matches the specification
    suggested scenario
  - Edge transparency (alpha=0.4) prevents visual clutter while maintaining connection
    visibility
  - White edge borders on nodes provide good contrast against axis lines
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a helper function node_to_cartesian() instead of inline calculation (minor
    KISS violation)
  - Figure size is 12x12 instead of recommended 16x9 default from library rules
  - Node labels could benefit from slightly larger font size (18pt instead of 16pt)
    for better readability
  image_description: 'The plot shows a hive plot with three radial axes arranged 120
    degrees apart in a triangular configuration. The axes are labeled "Core" (top,
    in Python blue #306998), "Utility" (bottom-left, in Python yellow #FFD43B), and
    "Interface" (bottom-right, in teal #4ECDC4). Each axis contains nodes represented
    as colored circles with white edge borders. Node labels are positioned adjacent
    to their respective markers (Engine, Config, Logger, Cache on Core axis; Parser,
    Validator, Formatter, Converter, Helper on Utility axis; API, Web, CLI, SDK on
    Interface axis). Curved edges connect nodes through the center point, with edge
    colors matching their source axis color at reduced opacity (alpha ~0.4). A small
    white center point marks the origin. The title "Software Module Dependencies"
    appears at the top with subtitle "hive-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A legend
    at the bottom shows the three module categories with their corresponding colors.'

        comment: uses LineCollection for efficient edge rendering and bezier curves,
          but doesn't leverage more advanced matplotlib features like FancyBboxPatch
          or custom transforms
  verdict: APPROVED
