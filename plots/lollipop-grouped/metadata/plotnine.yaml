review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable lollipop chart with proper grouping using position_dodge
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Realistic business data scenario with appropriate regional variation
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics (geom_segment + geom_point layering)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order is alphabetical rather than matching visual order or value order
  - Could use scale_color_brewer for more idiomatic plotnine usage
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across 4 regions (Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America,
    North America). Each region has 3 lollipops positioned side by side representing
    Hardware (blue #306998), Services (yellow #FFD43B), and Software (orange/red #E85D04).
    The lollipops consist of thin vertical stems extending from y=0 to circular markers
    at the value. The y-axis shows "Revenue (Million USD)" ranging from 0 to 100.
    The x-axis shows "Region" with the 4 categorical labels. A legend titled "Product
    Line" is positioned on the right side. The title "lollipop-grouped · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The background is white with subtle horizontal
    gridlines. Values vary appropriately: Software consistently highest (~65-100M),
    Hardware middle (~38-85M), Services lowest (~42-65M), with North America showing
    highest values and Latin America lowest.'
