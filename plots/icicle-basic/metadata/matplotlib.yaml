review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart label truncation prevents overlap while keeping labels readable where space
    permits
  - Colorblind-safe palette with appropriate contrast (black text on yellow, white
    on others)
  - Good use of file system metaphor as realistic, neutral example data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with inline data processing
  - Level labels on right side provide helpful context for hierarchy depth
  weaknesses:
  - Item-level (depth 3) labels are heavily truncated to 1-2 characters, making them
    difficult to identify
  - No random seed statement (though data is deterministic, adding np.random.seed(42)
    comment would clarify intent)
  - Could use matplotlib colormap instead of manual color list for better scalability
