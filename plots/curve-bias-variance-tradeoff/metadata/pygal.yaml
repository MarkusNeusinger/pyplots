review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of the fundamental ML concept with all four error components
  - Effective use of distinct line styles (dashed, dotted, solid) to differentiate
    curves
  - Optimal complexity point clearly marked with a prominent dot
  - Y-axis title cleverly includes the formula Total = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible
  - Good color choices that are mostly distinguishable
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Missing shaded regions for underfitting (left of optimal) and overfitting (right
    of optimal) zones as suggested in spec
  - No direct on-plot annotations labeling each curve (spec requests annotations to
    label each curve directly on the plot)
  - Irreducible error line is less prominent than other curves due to different dash
    pattern
  image_description: 'The plot displays the bias-variance tradeoff with four distinct
    curves on a white background. The title "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The X-axis is labeled "Model Complexity (Low
    → High)" ranging from 0 to 11, and the Y-axis is labeled "Prediction Error | Total
    = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible" ranging from 0 to 4.5. Four curves are shown
    with distinct colors and line styles: Bias² (blue dashed, decreasing from ~2.9
    to ~0.5), Variance (orange dashed, increasing from ~0 to ~3.2), Total Error (red
    solid, U-shaped with minimum around x=3.1), and Irreducible Error (teal dotted,
    constant at 0.5). A purple dot marks the optimal point at approximately (3.1,
    2.2). The legend is positioned at the bottom with colored squares for each series.
    The curves are smooth with 100 data points, and the distinct dash patterns help
    differentiate each curve clearly.'

          Could use more pygal-specific features like tooltips or value labels.
