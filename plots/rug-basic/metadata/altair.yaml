review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data choice that clearly demonstrates clustering patterns and
    gaps, fulfilling the spec core purpose
  - Proper use of Altair declarative grammar with mark_rule and y/y2 encoding to create
    tick marks
  - Good semi-transparency (opacity=0.6) to handle overlapping points in dense regions
  - Clean, simple code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with proper scale_factor for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Measurement Value lacks units (could be more specific like Response
    Time (ms) for a realistic scenario)
  - Large empty space above rug marks reduces canvas utilization, though inherent
    to standalone rug plots
