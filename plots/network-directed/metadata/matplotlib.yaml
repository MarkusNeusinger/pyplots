review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent directed graph visualization with clear arrow directions showing import
    dependencies
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good distinction between Core (blue), Api (yellow),
    Utils (green), and Tests (purple) groups
  - Well-positioned nodes using manual layout that minimizes edge crossings
  - Curved arrows effectively handle overlapping paths and clearly show direction
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with no functions or classes
  weaknesses:
  - Some node labels are slightly cramped within circles (e.g., validators, test_routes)
  - Node radius could be slightly larger to better accommodate longer labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a directed network graph representing software
    module dependencies. It shows 13 nodes (modules) connected by curved arrows indicating
    import direction. The nodes are colored by group: Core modules (main, config,
    database) in Python blue (#306998), Api modules (auth, routes, handlers) in Python
    yellow (#FFD43B), Utils modules (validators, helpers, logger, cache) in green
    (#4DAF4A), and Tests modules (test_auth, test_routes, test_db) in purple (#984EA3).
    The main module sits at the top with arrows flowing downward to its dependencies.
    Arrows are gray with appropriate arrowheads showing direction clearly. A legend
    in the upper-left explains the color coding by Module Type. The title "network-directed
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold.'
