  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with grade-range plotBands, mean/median plotLines,
    and bimodal peak annotations that guide the viewer through the distribution
  - Native use of Highcharts HistogramSeries with the histogram-bellcurve module —
    idiomatic and leveraging library-specific functionality
  - Bimodal data design (main group + high achievers) effectively showcases histogram
    capabilities
  - All font sizes explicitly set for the 4800x2700 canvas, ensuring perfect readability
  - Connector-style annotations via the Highcharts Annotations API add professional
    polish
  - Subtitle provides narrative context that enriches the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - The primary peak annotation connector points to approximately x=66 rather than
    the actual peak bin center near 72-75, creating slight visual misalignment
  - Mean (75.3) and Median (75.8) labels are very close together, causing minor visual
    crowding despite being placed on opposite sides
  image_description: The plot shows a histogram of university exam score distribution
    rendered with Highcharts. The chart uses deep blue (#306998) bars with dark borders
    against a light gray (#fafbfc) background. There are approximately 20 bins spanning
    scores from ~30 to ~100. The x-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)" with tick
    marks every 5 points, and the y-axis shows "Number of Students" from 0 to 60.
    A red dashed vertical line marks the Mean (75.3) and a blue dotted line marks
    the Median (75.8), with styled labels on each. The chart title reads "Exam Score
    Distribution · histogram-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold dark text, with
    a subtitle providing narrative context about 500 students. Color-coded plotBands
    at the top delineate grade ranges (D/F in red, C in orange, B in green, A in blue,
    A+ in purple) with subtle background shading. Two connector-style annotations
    call out the "Primary peak" (~72 pts, main group 80%) and "Secondary peak" (~88
    pts, high achievers 20%). The bimodal distribution is clearly visible with the
    main cluster around 65-80 and a secondary bump around 85-92. Bars have no gaps
    between them and feature subtle drop shadows.
