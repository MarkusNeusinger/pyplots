review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent strip plot overlay on box plots showing individual data points — a seaborn-idiomatic
    pattern
  - Well-chosen realistic salary scenario with meaningful variation across departments
  - Clean, modern seaborn API usage (hue parameter, legend=False)
  - Professional formatting with currency-formatted y-axis labels
  - All text sizes explicitly set for the target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: could add annotations highlighting key insights (e.g.,
    highest median, widest spread, summary statistics)'
  - Strip plot points are slightly small (size=4) — increasing to 5-6 would improve
    visibility
  - Notable empty space in upper canvas region; y-axis range extends well beyond data
    density
  - Per-category data generation uses verbose if/elif chain instead of a cleaner dictionary
    mapping
  - Could use more distinctive seaborn features (e.g., sns.set_context, sns.despine
    instead of manual spine removal)
  image_description: 'The plot displays five box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one for each department: Engineering (dark blue), Marketing (golden/amber), Sales
    (green), HR (coral/orange), and Finance (purple). Each box shows the median as
    a horizontal black line, with the box spanning Q1 to Q3. Whiskers extend to approximately
    1.5×IQR. Individual data points are overlaid as a semi-transparent strip plot
    (jittered) in matching colors, making outliers and the full distribution visible.
    The y-axis is labeled "Salary ($)" with formatted tick labels ($40K–$160K). The
    x-axis is labeled "Department". The title reads "box-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    in medium weight. Top and right spines are removed, and a subtle horizontal grid
    assists value reading. The layout is clean with good use of canvas space.'

        comment: stripplot overlay is seaborn-specific but relies heavily on matplotlib
          for styling. Could use sns.despine(), sns.set_context().
