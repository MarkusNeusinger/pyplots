review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of mosaic layout concept with 5 diverse chart types showing
    different spanning patterns (2×2, 1×1, 2×1)
  - Creative solution using PIL to composite multiple pygal charts into a cohesive
    dashboard
  - Well-designed custom style with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Bonus HTML output with interactive SVG grid demonstrates pygal web-native strength
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with coherent data narrative
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (render_chart_to_image, get_svg_content) which violates
    KISS principle for plot implementations
  - Does not demonstrate empty cell placeholder feature mentioned in spec
