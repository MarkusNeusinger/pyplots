review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately sized fonts for the high-resolution
    output
  - Perfect spec compliance including all required radar chart features
  - Colorblind-accessible palette choice enhances accessibility
  - Clean, professional visual presentation with subtle grid styling
  - Realistic employee performance comparison scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is only used for theming/styling, not for actual plotting - the radar
    chart is built entirely with matplotlib polar subplot
  - Legend positioned at bbox_to_anchor=(0.95, 0.95) places it outside the main plot
    area, creating slight visual imbalance
