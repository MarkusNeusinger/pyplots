review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of damped harmonic oscillator phase portrait with clear
    spiral convergence to equilibrium
  - Effective use of color gradient to show time evolution (blue to yellow)
  - Well-marked start and end points with distinct markers (circle and square)
  - Reference lines at x=0 and dx/dt=0 help identify equilibrium and zero-crossing
    points
  - Clean, professional appearance with proper plotnine grammar of graphics implementation
  - Mathematically correct derivative calculation for damped oscillator
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include physical units (e.g., Position x (m), Velocity dx/dt
    (m/s))
  - Only single trajectory shown; spec notes that multiple trajectories from different
    initial conditions could reveal basin of attraction structure
