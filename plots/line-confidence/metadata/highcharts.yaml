review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
    (72px title, 48px axis titles, 36px labels)
  - Correct implementation of confidence band using AreaRangeSeries with appropriate
    fill opacity (0.3)
  - Growing uncertainty is well-demonstrated through widening confidence interval
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines for Selenium-based PNG
    export
  - Colorblind-safe single-hue color scheme (#306998)
  - Proper use of highcharts-more.js module for arearange functionality
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Day" could include context, "Predicted Value" could
    specify units)
  - Legend positioned relatively far from the data area; could be positioned closer
    for better association
  - Does not leverage interactive Highcharts features (though this is acceptable for
    static PNG output)
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with a confidence interval on
    a white background. A dark blue (#306998) central line represents the "Prediction"
    values, showing an upward trend with sinusoidal oscillations over 50 days. The
    light blue semi-transparent shaded band (30% opacity) represents the "95% Confidence
    Interval" which visibly widens as time increases, illustrating growing uncertainty.
    The title "line-confidence · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold,
    with a subtitle "Model Predictions with 95% Confidence Interval" below it. The
    Y-axis is labeled "Predicted Value" (ranging from ~80-280), and the X-axis is
    labeled "Day" (1-50). A vertical legend in the top-right corner identifies both
    series. Dashed gray grid lines enhance readability.
