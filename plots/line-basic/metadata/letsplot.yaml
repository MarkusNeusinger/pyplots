review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature pattern that clearly demonstrates line plot trends
  - Perfect title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800×2700 output with scale=3
  - Good use of theme_minimal() and custom theme elements for professional appearance
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated as expected for interactive library
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent (dashed style helps but alpha could be lower)
  - Does not leverage lets-plot specific interactive features like tooltips or hover
    effects
  - Markers (size=5) are slightly large for 12 data points; size=4 would be more proportionate
