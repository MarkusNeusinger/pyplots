review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of dependency arrows with custom arrowheads using geom_segment
  - Clear visual hierarchy with group headers (thicker bars) and indented task labels
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geom_segment calls
  - Appropriate color scheme that distinguishes phases clearly
  - Well-structured data preparation for mapping tasks to y-positions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays phases in alphabetical order instead of intended project phase
    order despite using CategoricalDtype and limits parameter
  - Legend title shows Phase instead of Project Phase as defined in code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart for a software development project
    with 4 phases (Requirements, Design, Development, Testing). Each phase has a thicker
    aggregate bar showing the overall phase duration, with thinner individual task
    bars nested below. Dependency arrows with arrowheads connect tasks showing finish-to-start
    relationships. Colors: dark blue (#306998) for Requirements, light blue (#4B8BBE)
    for Design, yellow (#FFD43B) for Development, and gray (#646464) for Testing.
    The y-axis shows hierarchical task labels with "▸" prefix for group headers and
    indentation for tasks. The x-axis displays dates from January to March 2024 with
    rotated labels. Legend on the right shows "Phase" with the 4 categories, though
    displayed in alphabetical order rather than project sequence. Title correctly
    formatted as "gantt-dependencies · plotnine · pyplots.ai".'
