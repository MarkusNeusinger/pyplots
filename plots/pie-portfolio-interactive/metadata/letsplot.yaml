review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot geom_pie with donut hole (hole=0.35) and rich tooltips
  - Well-structured drill-down capability with ggbunch for HTML export showing all
    category breakdowns
  - Realistic portfolio data with meaningful asset names and plausible allocations
  - Clean visual design with white stroke separating slices and center label
  - Good use of layer_tooltips with formatted numbers and drill-down hints
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart to reduce whitespace
  - Wildcard imports with noqa comments reduce code clarity
  - Static PNG does not demonstrate the interactive drill-down capability (only visible
    in HTML)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart showing portfolio allocation
    across 4 asset classes. Fixed Income (blue, #306998) takes the largest share at
    38.0%, followed closely by Equities (yellow, #FFD43B) at 37.0%, Alternatives (red,
    #DC2626) at 21.0%, and Cash (green, #059669) at 4.0%. The donut has a white center
    with "Portfolio 100%" label displayed in a semi-transparent white box. Each slice
    displays its percentage value with clear, readable text (size 20). A legend titled
    "Asset Class" is positioned on the right side (at x=0.82) listing all four categories
    with color-coded markers. The title reads "pie-portfolio-interactive · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" in bold centered text with a subtitle "Hover for details | Click
    category to drill down" in gray. White stroke (width 2.5) separates the slices
    cleanly. The overall layout uses theme_void for a clean, minimal appearance without
    axes or gridlines.'
