review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn clustermap function with all key parameters (method,
    metric, row_colors, col_colors)
  - Well-designed synthetic data with three distinct gene clusters showing different
    response patterns to treatment
  - Clean diverging colormap (RdBu_r) centered at zero, appropriate for expression
    data
  - Informative legends for both gene groups and experimental conditions
  - Proper dendrogram display on both axes demonstrating hierarchical relationships
  - Realistic gene expression analysis context with Control/Treatment experimental
    design
  weaknesses:
  - The Condition legend placement partially overlaps with the Genes y-axis label,
    creating visual clutter
  - The two separate legends (Gene Group and Condition) could potentially be better
    positioned
