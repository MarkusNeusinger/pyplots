review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of center space for total budget display
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate ring width
  - Percentage labels are bold white and highly readable inside segments
  - Category labels well-positioned outside the ring without overlap
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai standards
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with sensible departmental values
  - Square figure size appropriate for circular chart
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features (relies on matplotlib pie for the actual
    chart)
  - Could benefit from more extreme variation in segment sizes to better demonstrate
    donut chart capabilities
