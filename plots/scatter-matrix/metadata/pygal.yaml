review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using PIL composite to build a scatter matrix from individual
    pygal charts
  - Excellent use of pygal.Histogram for diagonal cells showing univariate distributions
  - Good transparency handling (opacity=0.55) makes overlapping points distinguishable
  - Clean Iris-like dataset with visible positive and negative correlations
  - Proper title format following pyplots convention
  - Variable labels positioned on both left (rotated) and bottom edges as per spec
  - Square 3600x3600 format is appropriate for matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis tick labels within cells are somewhat small relative to the overall image
    size
  - Could benefit from subtle grid lines within scatter cells for reference
