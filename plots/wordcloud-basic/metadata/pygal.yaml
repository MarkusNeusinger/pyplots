review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using pygal XY chart as canvas with custom SVG text injection
  - Excellent spiral placement algorithm that distributes words without overlap
  - Good color palette using pyplots brand colors (blue/yellow)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with word sizes proportional to frequency
  - Correct title format and clean white background
  - Tech buzzwords provide relatable, realistic example data
  weaknesses:
  - Word cloud occupies only center portion of canvas; bottom 30% is mostly empty
    white space
  - Some smaller words (GraphQL, Terraform) have reduced visibility due to size
  - Heavy reliance on SVG manipulation rather than native pygal features
