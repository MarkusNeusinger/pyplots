review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a geographic heatmap in pygal despite the library
    not having native support
  - Creative use of custom Graph subclass to extend pygal capabilities for geographic
    visualization
  - Smooth Gaussian-blurred heatmap with proper transparency for basemap visibility
  - Well-designed colorbar with gradient segments and appropriate tick labels
  - California coastline approximation adds valuable geographic context
  - Three distinct density clusters clearly demonstrate the spatial density concept
  - Clean color interpolation for smooth gradients
  - Good use of YlOrRd sequential colormap which is colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure uses a custom class (GeoHeatmap) instead of KISS pattern - necessary
    for this complex visualization but deviates from guidelines
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently at 0.5 opacity, could be 0.3)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic heatmap of California showing
    spatial density of environmental monitoring stations. The visualization features
    a light blue (#e8f4f8) background representing the geographic area with California''s
    coastline rendered as dark gray polylines. A continuous color gradient heatmap
    is overlaid, using a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red) colormap where yellow represents
    low density (0.0) and deep red represents high density (105.5). Three distinct
    hotspot clusters are clearly visible: one in Northern California around 38.5°N/-122.5°W,
    one on the Central Coast around 36.5°N/-121.5°W, and one in Southern California
    around 34°N/-118°W. Blue circular markers (r=12) with dark borders represent individual
    station locations, scattered across the heatmap. The colorbar on the right shows
    the "Density" scale with 5 tick values. A legend below the colorbar identifies
    the blue markers as "Station". Axis labels show "Longitude (°)" and "Latitude
    (°)" with appropriate tick marks. The title follows the correct format: "heatmap-geographic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
