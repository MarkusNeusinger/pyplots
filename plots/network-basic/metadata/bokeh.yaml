review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (HoverTool with name and connection
    count)
  - Well-implemented force-directed layout algorithm that clearly separates communities
  - Node degree-based sizing effectively highlights more connected individuals
  - Clean, readable code structure with good comments
  - Colorblind-safe palette with four distinct colors
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is far too small and poorly positioned - needs much larger text (currently
    nearly illegible at 4800x2700)
  - 'Title format incorrect: shows "Social Network · network-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    but spec requires "network-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"'
  - Layout is diagonally biased, leaving significant empty space in top-right and
    bottom-left corners
