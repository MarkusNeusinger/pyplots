review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean stacking logic with proper bottom position calculation
  - Well-styled for large canvas with appropriate font sizes (36pt title, 28pt labels,
    24pt ticks)
  - White line borders between segments enhance visual clarity
  - Proper use of Bokeh Legend and LegendItem for positioned legend
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output as expected for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool to show values on hover, which is a key Bokeh interactive feature
  - Legend positioned on right creates some visual imbalance with empty space between
    plot and legend
