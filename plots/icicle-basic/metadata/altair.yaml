review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships visible
    through spatial adjacency
  - Smart label hiding for narrow rectangles prevents text overlap
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax with mark_rect and transform_calculate
  - Interactive tooltips enhance usability
  - File system example matches specification suggested application perfectly
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with iterative tree building
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses only blue hues which may reduce accessibility for some colorblind
    users; consider using more distinct hues across levels
  - Some leaf nodes appear very narrow making the hierarchy harder to read in that
