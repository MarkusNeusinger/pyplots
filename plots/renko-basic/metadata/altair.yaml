review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Renko chart implementation using mark_rect with x2/y2 encoding
  - Colorblind-friendly teal/coral color scheme
  - Good use of tooltips showing brick details (open, close, direction)
  - Clean brick separation with 0.85 width creating visual gaps
  - Proper data generation showing realistic price action with trend reversals
  - Correct title format and well-labeled axes with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from interactive zoom/pan using .interactive() which is a distinctive
    Altair feature
  - Data scenario is generic rather than a specific realistic context
  image_description: The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 60 bricks
    showing stock price movements from around $88 to $126. The chart uses teal/green
    (#26A69A) colored rectangular bricks for bullish (upward) price movements and
    coral/red (#EF5350) colored bricks for bearish (downward) movements. The title
    "renko-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The Y-axis is labeled
    "Price ($)" ranging from 86 to 130, and the X-axis shows "Brick Index" from 0
    to 60. A legend in the top-right corner indicates "Direction" with Bullish and
    Bearish categories. The bricks are uniform in height ($2 each), appropriately
    separated with small gaps, and clearly show trend patterns - a downtrend from
    brick 0-14 reaching a low around $88, followed by an uptrend to approximately
    $126 at brick 52, then a small pullback. A subtle gray grid helps identify price
    levels.
