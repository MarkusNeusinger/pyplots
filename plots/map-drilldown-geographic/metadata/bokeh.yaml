quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data structure with 3 levels (countries, states, cities)
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, patches, HoverTool, TapTool,
    CustomJS'
  - Proper breadcrumb navigation implementation
  - Clean color scale with Blues9 palette
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Value labels defined in code are not visible in the PNG output
  - Color bar is partially cut off at the right edge despite min_border_right setting
  - Significant empty space on the left side of the plot creates unbalanced layout
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic drilldown map showing 5 countries
    in the Americas (Canada, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina) as simplified
    rectangular polygons. Each country is colored using a sequential blue color scale
    based on sales values. Canada appears in dark blue (high value), United States
    in medium-dark blue, Brazil in medium blue, Mexico in light blue, and Argentina
    in very light blue/white. The title "map-drilldown-geographic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. A breadcrumb showing "📍 World" appears in the top-left
    corner. The color bar legend labeled "Sales ($M)" is positioned on the right side
    showing values from 0-800. Axis labels show "Longitude" (x-axis) and "Latitude"
    (y-axis). An instruction text at the bottom reads "Click on a region to drill
    down into its subdivisions. Currently showing: Countries → States (US) → Cities
    (California)". Country names are visible inside each polygon but value labels
    are NOT visible in the static PNG output.'
