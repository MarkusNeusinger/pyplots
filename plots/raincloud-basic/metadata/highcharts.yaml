review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three raincloud components (cloud, rain, box plot)
    positioned correctly relative to each other
  - Creative use of Highcharts polygon series to create smooth half-violin density
    curves with inline KDE calculation
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B effectively demonstrates the visualization
    power to reveal hidden distribution characteristics
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Proper whisker calculation using IQR method for box plots
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-right creates slight layout imbalance; could be positioned
    closer to the plot area
  - Box plot fill colors use rgba calculation that could be simplified
  - Individual points marker size could be slightly larger for better visibility at
    this canvas scale
