review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent two-panel layout effectively demonstrates the navigator concept
  - Good use of color differentiation between full dataset and selected range in navigator
  - Proper use of pygal styling with custom Style objects
  - HTML output includes both charts with proper SVG embedding
  - Realistic sensor data with trend, seasonality, and noise components
  - Appropriate proportions between main chart and navigator (~80/20 split)
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels slightly overlap due to density
  - Navigator panel text/labels are quite small relative to the canvas
  - Legend label Detail View in main chart could be more descriptive
  - The white strip between charts in combined PNG could be eliminated for cleaner

  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a two-panel visualization for a line chart with mini navigator. The main chart (top, ~80% height) shows "Detail View" data as a blue line (#306998) representing sensor readings over time, spanning approximately from 2023-02-05 to 2023-08-04 (the selected range). The Y-axis shows "Sensor Reading" values ranging from ~50 to 92, and the X-axis shows "Date" with rotated labels at regular intervals. The title follows the correct format: "line-navigator · pygal · pyplots.ai".

    The navigator panel (bottom, ~20% height) displays the full 3-year dataset with two overlaid series: "Full Dataset" shown as a blue filled area and "Selected Range" highlighted in yellow/gold (#FFD43B). This effectively shows which portion of the full data is being viewed in the main chart. The navigator has a gray background (#f5f5f5) to visually distinguish it from the main chart. The legend at the bottom shows "Full Dataset" and "Selected Range" labels.
