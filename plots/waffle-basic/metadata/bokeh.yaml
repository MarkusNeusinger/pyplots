review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the waffle chart concept with proper 10×10 grid layout
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with clear comments
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and Legend API
  - Good color choices with Python blue as primary color
  - Title follows the correct format specification
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output as expected for Bokeh
  - Appropriate square sizing (0.88) creates nice visual gaps between cells
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned far from the chart creating visual disconnect; could be placed
    closer or inside the plot area
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show category info
    on hover
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) and orange (#E34F26) could be more distinct for better colorblind
    accessibility
