review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule of thumb for bandwidth
    selection
  - Rug plot nicely shows individual observations as recommended in spec
  - Bimodal distribution effectively demonstrates density plot's ability to reveal
    distribution characteristics
  - Good use of Plotly's interactive features (hover templates, HTML export)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800×2700px output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label "Test Score" could include units for full VQ-06 credit
  - Could use more specific realistic context (e.g., "SAT Math Scores" instead of
    generic "Test Score")
  - Does not leverage Plotly's built-in density/histogram functions (ff.create_distplot
    or histogram with histnorm)
  image_description: The plot shows a density curve (KDE) for test scores ranging
    from approximately 30 to 120. The curve is rendered in a blue color (#306998)
    with a semi-transparent light blue fill under the curve. The distribution is slightly
    bimodal with a main peak around 75-78 and a secondary shoulder/peak around 85-88.
    A rug plot is displayed along the x-axis showing individual observations as vertical
    gray tick marks - these are densely clustered in the 60-95 range with sparse outliers
    below 50 and above 100. The title "density-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. Axis labels are "Test Score" (x-axis) and "Density" (y-axis). A legend
    in the upper right shows "Density" (line) and "Observations" (tick mark). The
    background uses the plotly_white template with subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Good use of hover templates for interactivity, HTML export for interactive
          version. However, manually computes KDE instead of using plotly's built-in
          histogram with histnorm='probability density' or ff.create_distplot. Still
          uses plotly features like fill='tozeroy' and custom hover templates.
  verdict: APPROVED
