review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: regression line, confidence
    band, R² value, and equation annotation'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good color contrast between blue scatter points and yellow regression line
  - Realistic educational scenario with plausible data distribution
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and Band for the confidence interval
  weaknesses:
  - Some exam scores exceed 100% which is unrealistic for percentage scores
  - Legend positioned far from the annotation; could be consolidated or moved closer
    to the statistical information
  - Does not leverage Bokeh distinctive interactive features (hover tooltips showing
    point values would enhance the visualization)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with 80 blue data points showing
    the relationship between Study Hours (x-axis, range 1-10) and Exam Score % (y-axis,
    range ~35-105). A golden/yellow regression line runs diagonally from bottom-left
    to top-right, surrounded by a light blue semi-transparent 95% confidence interval
    band. The regression equation "y = 5.40x + 42.85" and "R² = 0.791" are annotated
    in the upper-left area with a white background. The title "scatter-regression-linear
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in the bottom-right corner
    identifies "Linear Regression" (line) and "Data Points" (scatter). The overall
    layout uses a white background with subtle gray gridlines.

  verdict: APPROVED
