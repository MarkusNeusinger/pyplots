review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear step function representation of cumulative
    distribution
  - Thoughtful addition of percentile reference lines (25th, 50th, 75th) with dashed
    yellow styling that enhances understanding
  - Custom hover templates provide informative tooltips showing exact proportions
  - Proper use of shape=hv for authentic step function appearance
  - Good color scheme using Python Blue and Yellow with appropriate contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Uses manual histogram calculation with np.histogram instead of Plotly native go.Histogram
    with cumulative_enabled=True
  - Legend position in upper-left could be moved to avoid potential visual overlap
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram showing test score distribution.
    The main cumulative distribution curve is rendered as a step function in Python
    Blue (#306998) with a light blue fill beneath it (tozeroy fill). The x-axis shows
    "Test Score (points)" ranging from 0 to 100, and the y-axis shows "Cumulative
    Proportion" ranging from 0% to 100%. Three horizontal dashed yellow lines mark
    the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, with corresponding vertical dashed lines
    dropping down to the x-axis. Yellow circular markers with blue outlines are placed
    at each percentile intersection point, labeled with "25%", "50%", and "75%" text.
    The title "histogram-cumulative · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    A legend in the upper-left corner identifies the "Cumulative Distribution" trace.
    The background uses the plotly_white template with subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Grid is subtle at 0.1 alpha (good), but legend could be better positioned
          (top-left overlaps with visual area slightly)

        comment: Good use of hover templates with custom formatting, but doesn't leverage
          Plotly's built-in histogram with cumulative=True parameter which would be
          more idiomatic
  verdict: APPROVED
