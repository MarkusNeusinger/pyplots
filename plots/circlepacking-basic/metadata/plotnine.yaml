review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with three distinct color levels (gray root, blue departments,
    yellow teams)
  - Clean implementation using geom_polygon to draw circles - creative use of plotnine
    grammar
  - Proper area encoding (radius proportional to sqrt of value) for accurate visual
    perception
  - Well-organized code with clear data structure and manual positioning
  - Professional layout with centered title and horizontal legend
  - Realistic company organizational data that demonstrates the concept well
  weaknesses:
  - Lower half of the root circle has noticeable empty space - departments could be
    positioned more centrally
  - Team label font sizes are relatively small compared to department labels
  - Size differences between similarly-valued teams are not visible
