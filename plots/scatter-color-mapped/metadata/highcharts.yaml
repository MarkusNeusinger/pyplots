review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis colormap implementation that is colorblind-safe
  - Custom colorbar with gradient rendering demonstrates advanced Highcharts usage
  - Clean tooltip showing all three data dimensions (X, Y, Temperature)
  - Appropriate marker sizing with subtle outlines for point visibility
  - Good use of Highcharts renderer API for the colorbar
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function (interpolate_color) instead of pure sequential
    KISS structure
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., X Position (km) for the geographic scenario)
  image_description: The plot displays a color-mapped scatter plot with approximately
    150 data points distributed across the canvas. Points are colored using the viridis
    colormap, transitioning from dark purple (~0°C) in the bottom-left to bright yellow
    (~68°C) in the upper-right region. The title "scatter-color-mapped · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The X-axis is labeled "X Position" (range 0-98)
    and Y-axis "Y Position" (range 0-84). A colorbar on the right shows "Temperature
    (°C)" with tick marks at 0, 14, 27, 41, 55, and 68. The scatter points have subtle
    dark outlines and are appropriately sized for the data density. Grid lines are
    visible but subtle.
