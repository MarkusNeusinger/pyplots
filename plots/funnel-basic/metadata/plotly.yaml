review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native go.Funnel trace type for optimal funnel visualization
  - Clear value and percentage labels inside each segment using textinfo=value+percent
    initial
  - Well-chosen color palette with Python Blue as primary creating visual distinction
    between stages
  - Proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with good margins and font sizing
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs leveraging Plotly interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The blue color gradient (4 shades of blue + yellow) could be improved for better
    accessibility - consider using a more varied colorblind-safe palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical funnel chart with 5 stages: Awareness
    (dark blue, #306998), Interest (steel blue, #4682B4), Consideration (teal, #5F9EA0),
    Intent (light blue, #6CA6CD), and Purchase (yellow, #FFD43B). Each trapezoidal
    segment shows both count and percentage of initial (1000/100%, 600/60%, 400/40%,
    200/20%, 100/10%). Stage names appear on the left y-axis, with "Stage" as the
    axis label. Gray connector lines separate segments. The title "funnel-basic ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The funnel progressively narrows
    from top to bottom, clearly illustrating the conversion drop-off at each stage.'
