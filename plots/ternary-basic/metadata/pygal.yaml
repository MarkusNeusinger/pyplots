review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of ternary plot using pygal XY chart type since pygal
    lacks native ternary support
  - Excellent use of SVG manipulation to add vertex and percentage labels that pygal
    cannot natively produce
  - Realistic soil composition data with meaningful variation across the ternary space
  - Proper ternary coordinate transformation from compositional data to Cartesian
    coordinates
  - Clean grid lines at 20% intervals with appropriate styling
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only Soil Samples which adds little value for a single-series plot
  - Some whitespace below the plot area could be better utilized
  - Percentage labels along edges are relatively small compared to vertex labels
