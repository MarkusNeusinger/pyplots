review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper layering
  - Excellent bimodal data generation showing both main distribution and high achievers
  - Proper use of theme customization for text sizing and grid styling
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scaling for 4800x2700 output
  - Good color choice with appropriate alpha for fill transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Test Score (points)" or "Density (probability)")
  - Test score values exceeding 100 are unrealistic for typical grading scales
  - Could benefit from a rug plot to show individual observations as suggested in
    spec notes
  image_description: The plot displays a smooth kernel density estimation curve showing
    the distribution of test scores. The x-axis shows "Test Score" ranging from approximately
    30 to 120, while the y-axis shows "Density" ranging from 0 to about 0.026. The
    density curve is filled with Python blue (#306998) with appropriate transparency,
    and the outline is the same color. The distribution is bimodal, with a primary
    peak around 75 and a secondary peak around 88, reflecting the mixture of a main
    student group and high achievers. The title "density-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is positioned at the top. The background is clean with subtle gray gridlines on
    a minimal theme. The overall layout has good proportions in 16:9 aspect ratio.

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar correctly with geom_density, theme_minimal,
          and proper ggsize for scaling, but doesn't leverage lets-plot specific interactive
          features or advanced density options
  verdict: APPROVED
