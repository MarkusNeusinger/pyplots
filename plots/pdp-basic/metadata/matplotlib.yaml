review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PDP with ICE lines using sklearn partial_dependence
    function with kind=both
  - Proper confidence band visualization using fill_between with mean ± 1.96*std
  - Rug plot effectively shows training data distribution along x-axis
  - Clean, readable code that follows KISS principles
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme with Python blue and yellow
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper left slightly overlaps with ICE lines - consider frameon=True
    with white background
  - Rug plot markers (s=100) could be larger (s=150-200) for better visibility on
    high-resolution canvas
  - Y-axis range dominated by wide confidence band making PDP line variation appear
    minimal
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) with a blue
    color scheme. The main PDP line is a thick dark blue line (#306998) showing a
    gentle upward slope from approximately -50 at feature value -2 to +40 at feature
    value +1.7. A light blue 95% confidence band surrounds the main line, spanning
    from about -300 to +250 in the middle range. Faint ICE (Individual Conditional
    Expectation) lines are visible as semi-transparent blue curves within the confidence
    band. A yellow/gold rug plot at the bottom of the chart (at y ≈ -290) shows the
    distribution of training data values as vertical tick marks, concentrated between
    -1 and +1 feature values. The title reads "pdp-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. X-axis is labeled "Feature Value" and Y-axis is labeled "Partial Dependence
    (Predicted Value)". A legend in the upper left shows three items: 95% Confidence
    Interval, Partial Dependence, and Data Distribution. The grid is subtle with dashed
    lines at alpha=0.3.'

        comment: Shows PDP with ICE lines showing individual variation, confidence

        comment: Uses matplotlib's fill_between for confidence band, scatter for rug
          plot, but could leverage more matplotlib-specific features like ax.axhline
          for a reference line at y=0
  verdict: APPROVED
