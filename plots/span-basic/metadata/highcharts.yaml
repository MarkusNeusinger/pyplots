review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of BOTH vertical and horizontal spans in a single plot
  - Real-world scenario (2008-2009 recession) makes the visualization immediately
    understandable
  - Perfect use of Highcharts plotBands feature with labeled regions
  - Semi-transparent fills (0.25 alpha) allow data to remain visible as spec requires
  - Clean intersection where spans overlap shows thoughtful data design
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title "Date" is configured but not visible in the output (Highcharts behavior
    with categories)
  - Stock price values are somewhat generic; could reference a specific index for
    more realism
