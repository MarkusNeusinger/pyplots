# line-basic: Basic Line Plot

## Description

A basic line plot connects data points with straight lines to show how a continuous variable changes over a sequence or time. It's ideal for revealing trends, patterns, and changes in data over ordered intervals. The simplicity of a single-line design makes it easy to interpret at a glance.

## Applications

- Tracking stock prices or financial metrics over trading days
- Monitoring website traffic or user engagement over time
- Visualizing temperature changes throughout a day or season

## Data

- `x` (numeric/datetime) - Sequential or time values representing the independent variable
- `y` (numeric) - Continuous values representing the measured quantity
- Size: 10-200 points (enough to show trends without clutter)
- Example: Daily temperature readings, monthly sales figures

## Notes

- Clean, minimal design with a single line
- Clear axis labels for both X and Y axes
- Grid lines for improved readability
- Markers on data points are optional but can enhance visibility
