review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of event annotation pattern using plotLines with alternating
    label positions
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with blue line and yellow event markers
  - Proper use of Highcharts datetime axis with appropriate label formatting
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with proper Selenium screenshot
    workflow
  - Realistic business scenario with 5 distinct milestones across 180-day period
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Could leverage Highcharts native annotation module for more sophisticated event
    labels
  - Event marker scatter points could have tooltips showing event details for better
    interactivity in HTML output
