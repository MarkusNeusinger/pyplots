review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following KISS principle with clear data→plot→save structure
  - Correct Y-axis inversion (rank 1 at top) as required by spec
  - Effective use of Category10 colorblind-safe palette
  - Good marker and line sizing for data density
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for Bokeh best practices
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for maximum usability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend label font size (18pt) appears small in the rendered image relative to
    other text elements
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show team name and rank on hover for better interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing sports league standings
    over 6 weeks. Five teams (Team Alpha, Team Beta, Team Gamma, Team Delta, Team
    Epsilon) are represented by colored lines (blue, orange, green, red, purple respectively)
    using the Category10 palette. The Y-axis shows "Rank Position" from 1-5 with rank
    1 at the top (inverted axis). The X-axis shows "Week" labels from Week 1 to Week
    6. Each team''s trajectory is shown with connected lines and circular dot markers
    at each week. A legend is positioned on the right side. The title follows the
    required format: "bump-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai". The background is a subtle
    light gray (#fafafa) with dashed grid lines.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, Legend model, proper categorical x_range setup,
          export_png + HTML output. Could leverage more interactive features like
          HoverTool for a bump chart.
  verdict: APPROVED
