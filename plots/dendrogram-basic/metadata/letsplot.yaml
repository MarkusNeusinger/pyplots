review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of dendrogram from scratch using geom_segment - creative
    solution since lets-plot does not have built-in dendrogram support
  - Clear hierarchical structure with proper Ward distance calculations using scipy
  - Good color threshold system distinguishing major clusters (blue) from subclusters
    (yellow)
  - Appropriate text sizing and angled labels prevent overlap
  - Realistic iris flower dataset demonstrates meaningful clustering results
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis extends into negative territory (to -2) when all distance values are non-negative;
    should start at 0 or slightly below label positions
  - X-axis label Sample is generic; could be more descriptive like Iris Samples or
    simply removed since individual labels are shown
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical dendrogram showing clustering
    of 15 iris flower samples across three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
    The tree structure uses two colors: blue (#306998) for the top-level merge connecting
    the Setosa cluster to the Versicolor/Virginica cluster at distance ~10, and yellow/gold
    (#FFD43B) for all lower-level merges. The Y-axis shows "Distance (Ward)" ranging
    from -2 to 12, and the X-axis shows "Sample" with individual sample labels (e.g.,
    Setosa-1, Versicolor-3, Virginica-5) displayed at a 35-degree angle. The title
    "dendrogram-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The hierarchical
    structure clearly shows Setosa samples clustering together on the left, while
    Versicolor and Virginica samples form a separate major branch on the right, which
    is scientifically accurate for iris data.'

        comment: Good use of geom_segment, geom_text, scale_color_manual, and theme
          customization. However, doesn't leverage lets-plot's interactive features
          in the HTML export or more advanced theming capabilities.
  verdict: APPROVED
