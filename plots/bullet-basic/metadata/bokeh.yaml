review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear grayscale qualitative bands that do not distract
    from the primary measure
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling following the specification
  - Realistic sales dashboard scenario with varied performance levels (above/below
    target)
  - Clean implementation showing all required bullet chart components (actual bar,
    target marker, ranges)
  - Good use of Bokeh Label model for metric annotations
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the grayscale bands (poor/satisfactory/good)
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
