review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent mosaic layout implementation using Plotly make_subplots with colspan
    specifications to achieve the AAB/CCD/EFG pattern
  - Well-designed business dashboard scenario with coherent data narrative
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear comments explaining
    the layout pattern
  - Good visual hierarchy with larger panels for primary data and smaller panels for
    supporting metrics
  - Proper use of Plotly white template and consistent color scheme
  - Correctly implements both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter plot markers in Product Performance panel are slightly small (size=12)
    for 80 data points at this canvas size
  - Missing demonstration of empty cell/gap feature using placeholder mentioned in
    spec
  - Bottom row metric panels feel slightly cramped; row_heights could be adjusted
    for better balance
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a dashboard-style mosaic layout with 7 subplots arranged in a 3-row structure. The title "subplot-mosaic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.

    **Row 1:** A wide "Revenue Trend (Overview)" line chart with blue fill spans 2 columns on the left, showing an upward trend from ~50k to ~62k over Jan-Apr 2024. A narrower "Monthly Sales" bar chart (yellow bars) occupies the right column, displaying Jan-Jun sales data.

    **Row 2:** A "Product Performance" scatter plot with blue markers spans 2 columns showing Feature X vs Feature Y distribution (80 points). A "Category Distribution" horizontal bar chart with multi-colored bars (blue, yellow, gray, brown) shows Electronics, Clothing, Food, Books, Sports categories on the right.

    **Row 3:** Three smaller metric panels - "Efficiency" (blue area chart, 0-100%), "Quality Score" (yellow area chart, 0-70 Score), and "Response Time" (blue line chart, 0-60 ms), each showing 30-day trends.

    Colors are consistent (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B). All text is legible. Layout shows clear visual hierarchy with larger panels for primary data.
