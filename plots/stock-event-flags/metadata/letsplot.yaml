review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the flag-style markers with dashed connector lines
  - Good use of alternating heights for flags to avoid overlap
  - Proper color coding for different event types with accessible palette
  - Interactive tooltips add value for exploring event details
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap in crowded regions (Q2 Earnings Miss area)
  - Event labels could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Could use more distinctive shapes beyond diamond for different event types
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price chart spanning January 2024
    to September 2024. The main price line is rendered in blue (#306998) showing price
    movement from ~150 to a peak of ~163 in early February, then declining to ~122
    in June before recovering to ~149 by September. Nine event flags are positioned
    above the price line with dashed vertical connector lines linking them to the
    corresponding price points. Event types are color-coded: Earnings (blue diamonds),
    Dividend (green), News (orange/yellow), and Split (red). Event labels appear above
    each diamond marker (e.g., "Q4 Earnings Beat", "Dividend $0.25", "Product Launch").
    The title follows the correct format "stock-event-flags · letsplot · pyplots.ai".
    The legend on the right shows the four event types. Axis labels read "Date" (x-axis)
    and "Stock Price ($)" (y-axis). The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gridlines.'
