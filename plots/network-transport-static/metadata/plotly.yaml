review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex network diagram using Plotly graph objects
  - Good use of color coding to distinguish route types (Express, Regional, Local)
  - Offset calculation for multiple routes between same stations prevents overlap
  - Hover tooltips provide detailed route information (route ID, stations, times)
  - Clean visual presentation with white nodes, clear labels, and directional arrows
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper left could be closer to the network visualization
  - Edge labels are rotated to follow edge direction which can make some times harder
    to read at certain angles
  image_description: 'The plot displays a regional rail network diagram with 11 station
    nodes (A through K) connected by directed edges representing train routes. Stations
    are shown as white circular nodes with blue borders, each labeled with a single
    letter inside and the full station name below. The network includes three route
    types distinguished by color: Express (Python Blue #306998), Regional (Python
    Yellow #FFD43B), and Local (Medium Slate Blue #7B68EE). Each edge shows an arrow
    indicating travel direction, and route labels display the route identifier and
    departure/arrival times (e.g., "RE 10 | 06:15→06:32"). The title "Regional Rail
    Network · network-transport-static · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    A legend in the upper left shows the three route types. Multiple routes between
    the same station pairs are offset to avoid overlap.'
