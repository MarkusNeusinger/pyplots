review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario demonstrating energy consumption vs temperature
    with realistic U-shaped relationship
  - R² value and polynomial equation prominently displayed with proper formatting
  - Clean use of plotnine geom_smooth with formula parameter for polynomial regression
  - Confidence band adds valuable statistical context
  - Color scheme provides excellent contrast and accessibility
  - Text sizing follows recommended guidelines perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Annotation text size (14pt) is slightly small compared to axis labels; could be
    more prominent at 16-18pt for better visibility
  - The confidence band uses the same color as the regression line which reduces visual
    distinction
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with a polynomial regression
    curve showing the relationship between Temperature (°C) on the x-axis (ranging
    from 0 to 40) and Energy Consumption (kWh) on the y-axis (ranging from approximately
    50 to 110). The scatter points are blue (#306998) with moderate transparency (alpha
    ~0.65). A golden-yellow (#FFD43B) polynomial curve fits through the data showing
    a clear U-shaped (quadratic) relationship, with a semi-transparent confidence
    band around it. The equation "y = 0.154x² - 6.204x + 111.68" and "R² = 0.980"
    are annotated in the upper right corner. The title follows the correct format
    "scatter-regression-polynomial · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The background is minimal
    with subtle grid lines.

        comment: Uses geom_smooth with formula syntax which is plotnine-specific,
          uses grammar of graphics approach; could have used more advanced features
          like scale_* customization
