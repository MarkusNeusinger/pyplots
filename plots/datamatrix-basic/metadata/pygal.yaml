review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with high-contrast black/white modules
  - Correct implementation of Data Matrix ECC 200 standard features (L-shaped finder,
    timing patterns)
  - Proper quiet zone implementation around the barcode
  - Good use of pygal SVG capabilities through custom Graph subclass
  - Clear labeling showing encoded content and matrix dimensions
  - Realistic use case with serial number encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses functions and a custom class instead of KISS structure (imports, data,
    plot, save)
  - Reed-Solomon and Galois field implementation is complex; could note this is a
    simplified demonstration
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Data Matrix 2D barcode on a white background
    with a light gray border. The barcode is an 18x18 matrix of black and white squares/modules.
    The characteristic L-shaped finder pattern is visible - solid black on the left
    edge and bottom edge. The top and right edges show the alternating timing pattern
    (black-white-black-white). The data matrix is well-centered on the square canvas
    with adequate quiet zone (white border) around it. Below the barcode, there is
    a blue text label reading "Content: SERIAL:12345678" and a smaller gray subtitle
    "Matrix: 18 x 18 | ECC 200". The title at the top correctly reads "datamatrix-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
