review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of clustered heatmap using pure plotnine grammar of graphics
  - 'Creative solution: manually constructing dendrograms with geom_segment since
    plotnine lacks native clustermap'
  - Proper use of scipy hierarchical clustering with Ward method
  - Diverging color scheme correctly centered at zero with Python-branded colors
  - Clean visual layout with well-proportioned dendrograms relative to heatmap
  - Realistic gene expression scenario demonstrating clear clustering patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Sample labels at bottom could be slightly larger for better readability at full
    resolution
  - Code is necessarily complex due to manual dendrogram coordinate calculation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered heatmap showing gene expression
    data for 12 genes (rows) across 8 samples (columns). The visualization features:

    - **Color scheme**: Diverging palette using Python Blue (#306998) for low expression,
    white for zero, and Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for high expression

    - **Dendrograms**: Row dendrogram on the left showing hierarchical gene clustering;
    column dendrogram on top showing sample clustering

    - **Labels**: Gene names (Gene1-Gene12) on the right side; sample names (SampleA-SampleH)
    at the bottom, rotated 45°

    - **Title**: "heatmap-clustered · plotnine · pyplots.ai" centered at top

    - **Legend**: Colorbar labeled "Expression Level" showing scale from -2 to 2

    - **Clustering patterns**: Clear groupings visible - genes 1-4 cluster together
    (high in samples A-D), genes 5-8 form another cluster (opposite pattern), genes
    9-12 show mixed patterns'

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_tile, geom_segment,
          geom_text, and scale_fill_gradient2. Manual dendrogram construction is necessary
          since plotnine lacks native clustering support.
  verdict: APPROVED
