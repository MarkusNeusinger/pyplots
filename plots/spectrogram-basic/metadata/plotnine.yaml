review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of chirp signal with frequency increasing over time
  - Proper use of dB scale for power representation
  - Well-formatted title following spec format exactly
  - Good axis labels with units as specified
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Clean, readable KISS code structure
  - Appropriate colormap that is perceptually reasonable
  weaknesses:
  - Custom color gradient could use a more perceptually uniform colormap like viridis
    (spec recommends viridis/inferno)
  - No grid lines to aid in reading specific time-frequency values
  - Frequency axis filtered to 500 Hz when chirp only reaches 200 Hz - could be tighter
    range for better visualization
  image_description: The spectrogram displays a time-frequency heatmap on a 16:9 canvas
    with a clean minimal theme. The x-axis shows "Time (s)" ranging from 0.0 to 2.0
    seconds, and the y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" ranging from 0 to 500 Hz. A colorbar
    on the right labeled "Power (dB)" shows the scale from approximately -70 dB (dark
    blue) to -20 dB (light yellow/cream). The plot clearly shows a chirp signal with
    frequency increasing linearly from about 50 Hz at t=0 to about 200 Hz at t=2,
    visible as a bright diagonal band sweeping upward across the time axis. The background
    noise appears as a mottled blue-green pattern at frequencies outside the chirp.

        comment: Uses geom_tile appropriately for heatmap, but custom color gradient
          instead of plotnine's scale functions; theme_minimal is good but basic usage
          overall
  verdict: APPROVED
