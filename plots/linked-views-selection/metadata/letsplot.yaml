review:
  strengths:
  - Clean multi-panel layout using gggrid
  - Consistent color encoding across all views
  - Good use of tooltips on scatter plot
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - KISS code structure
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: No linked selection functionality - The core requirement of this spec
    is that selecting data in one view automatically highlights or filters corresponding
    data points in all other views. This is completely missing.'
  - Does not use lets-plot selection features - lets-plot supports linked brushing
    via element_id_select() and selection aesthetics but these are not implemented
  - 'Two blue colors (Group A: #306998 and Group C: #4B8BBE) are too similar and hard
    to distinguish'
  - Custom legend panel wastes space - should use standard legend placement
  - Histogram stacking makes it hard to see individual group distributions
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 2x2 grid layout with an overall title "linked-views-selection · letsplot · pyplots.ai" at the top. The four panels are:

    1. Top-left: Scatter Plot - Shows 200 data points across four distinct clusters (Group A-D) with colors: dark blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), light blue (#4B8BBE), and gray (#646464). X-axis labeled "Measurement X", Y-axis labeled "Measurement Y". Title indicates "Select Points".

    2. Top-right: Histogram - Shows "Value Distribution" with stacked bars in the same four colors, displaying the distribution of values (ranging ~20-120) across all groups.

    3. Bottom-left: Bar Chart - "Category Distribution" showing equal counts (~50) for each of the four groups.

    4. Bottom-right: Legend - A custom legend panel showing the four groups with their corresponding colors and labels.

    The layout is clean with consistent color encoding across all views. Text is legible. The plots use minimal styling with subtle grids. However, there is NO interactive selection functionality visible - this is a static visualization that does not implement the linked selection behavior required by the specification.
