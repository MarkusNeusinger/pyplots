review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent gradient fill implementation using imshow clipped to the area polygon
    — visually appealing and demonstrates advanced matplotlib techniques
  - Data is well-crafted with realistic upward trend and periodic weekend dips that
    showcase the area chart purpose
  - Perfect text sizing following library guidelines (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Colorblind-safe blue palette (#306998) consistent with pyplots recommended colors
  - Clean readable code with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starting at 0 with data in 4000-7500 range leaves significant empty space
    at bottom, slightly reducing visual impact
  - Data could include one more interesting feature such as a notable spike or event
    for maximum feature coverage
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over a 30-day month. The x-axis shows "Day of Month" (1–30), and the y-axis shows
    "Daily Visitors (count)" (0–~8500). The area beneath the line is filled with a
    vertical gradient transitioning from light blue (#d6e6f5) at the bottom to a deeper
    blue (#306998) at the top, with alpha transparency of 0.6. The line itself is
    a solid dark blue (#306998) at linewidth 3. The data shows a clear upward trend
    from ~5000 visitors to ~7500 visitors, with periodic dips approximately every
    7 days corresponding to weekends. Gridlines are subtle dashed lines at alpha 0.3.
    The title reads "area-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format.
    Layout is clean with balanced margins and good canvas utilization via tight_layout.
