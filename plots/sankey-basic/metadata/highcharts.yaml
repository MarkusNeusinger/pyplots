review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world energy flow scenario with realistic TWh values
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe dark palette ensuring white text contrast on all
    nodes
  - Good link opacity (0.5) allowing visualization of crossing flows
  - Correct title format and informative subtitle with units
  - Well-configured Highcharts Sankey with custom node colors and link styling
  - Clean code structure with proper margin handling to prevent label cutoff
  weaknesses:
  - numpy imported but only used for random seed (could use deterministic data instead)
  - Library version shown as unknown in header comment
