review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (ribbon under
    line)
  - Confidence interval correctly widens over time demonstrating forecast uncertainty
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper figure sizing (16x9) and font scaling for high-resolution output
  - Legend clearly identifies both the confidence band and forecast line
  - Realistic business context (monthly sales forecast)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows two separate entries due to using both fill and color aesthetics
    - could be combined into single legend item
  - X-axis label Month lacks temporal context
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with a confidence interval band
    showing monthly sales forecast data over 24 months. The central trend line is
    a solid dark blue (#306998) line that shows an upward trend with seasonal fluctuations,
    starting around 55 and ending near 105 thousand. The confidence interval is rendered
    as a semi-transparent light blue shaded band (alpha 0.3) surrounding the central
    line. The band widens progressively as months increase, correctly representing
    growing uncertainty in forecasts over time. The title "line-confidence · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large text. Axis labels show "Month" (x-axis,
    0-25 range) and "Sales (thousands)" (y-axis, 60-120 range). A legend on the right
    side displays "95% CI" for the shaded band and "Forecast" for the line. The plot
    uses a clean minimal theme with subtle grid lines.
