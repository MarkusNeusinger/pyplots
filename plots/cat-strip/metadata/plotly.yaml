review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario with plant growth across soil types - realistic and scientifically
    relevant
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue/Yellow
  - Clean implementation of jitter using numpy random uniform
  - Custom hover templates enhance interactivity
  - Proper output in both PNG and HTML formats
  - Different distributions per category (varying means and standard deviations) plus
    explicit outliers demonstrate strip plot capabilities well
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is redundant with x-axis labels (both show Clay, Sandy, Loam, Peat, Chalk)
    - consider removing legend or using it for a different variable
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is perhaps too subtle - 0.2-0.3 would be more visible while
    still unobtrusive
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical strip plot showing plant height
    measurements (in cm) across five soil types: Clay, Sandy, Loam, Peat, and Chalk.
    Each category has its own distinct color: Clay in Python Blue (#306998), Sandy
    in Python Yellow (#FFD43B), Loam in coral red (#E15759), Peat in teal (#76B7B2),
    and Chalk in green (#59A14F). Individual data points are scattered vertically
    within each category with horizontal jitter applied to prevent overlap. The title
    "cat-strip · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The y-axis shows "Plant
    Height (cm)" ranging from ~10 to ~80, and the x-axis shows "Soil Type" with the
    five category labels. A legend in the upper right identifies each soil type by
    color. The background is clean white with subtle horizontal gridlines.'

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with custom hover templates which is good, but could
          leverage px.strip() for more idiomatic plotly usage; interactivity via HTML
          is included
  verdict: APPROVED
