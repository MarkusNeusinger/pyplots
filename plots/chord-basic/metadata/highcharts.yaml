review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts dependency wheel for chord diagram visualization
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with distinct colors for each continent
  - Comprehensive bidirectional migration flow data between all 6 continents
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS structure with well-organized code flow
  weaknesses:
  - Europe label is missing from the visible portion of the diagram - label may be
    positioned outside visible area or obscured
  image_description: 'The plot displays a chord/dependency wheel diagram showing migration
    flows between 6 continents. The diagram is circular with entities arranged around
    the perimeter: Oceania (orange) at the top, Europe (blue, arc visible but label
    missing), South America (green) on the left, Africa (purple) on the lower-left,
    Asia (yellow) at the bottom, and North America (cyan) on the right. Colored ribbons/chords
    connect the continents, with ribbon width proportional to migration flow magnitude.
    The title "chord-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    "Migration Flows Between Continents (Millions)". The background is white and all
    visible labels are clearly readable.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts dependency wheel which is native chord diagram support,
          includes tooltips configuration, but could leverage more interactive features
          in HTML output
  verdict: APPROVED
