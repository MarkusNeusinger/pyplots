review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn heatmap function with all appropriate parameters (mask,
    annot, cmap, center, vmin/vmax, square, linewidths, cbar_kws)
  - 'Perfect implementation of all spec requirements: diverging colormap centered
    at zero, 2-decimal annotations, upper triangle masked, fixed -1 to 1 colorbar
    range'
  - Realistic real estate dataset with meaningful variable relationships showing variety
    of correlation strengths
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - RdBu_r colormap is an excellent choice for correlation matrices - intuitive and
    colorblind accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units where applicable (e.g., Price ($), Sq Ft, Age
    (years), Distance (miles)) for additional context
