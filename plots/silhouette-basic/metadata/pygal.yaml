review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of horizontal bar chart to display silhouette values sorted by cluster
  - Good color scheme with Python-themed colors (blue, yellow) plus complementary
    red
  - Proper demonstration of negative silhouette values indicating poor cluster membership
  - Clean code structure with clear data generation for overlapping clusters
  - Legend includes cluster averages for quick reference
  - Uses pygal Style for consistent theming
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very faint and the average reference line (dashed) is not prominent
    enough for easy reading
  - Title format includes extra line with metadata instead of clean single-line format
  - Cluster separation in the plot could be more visually distinct (spacing between
    cluster groups)
