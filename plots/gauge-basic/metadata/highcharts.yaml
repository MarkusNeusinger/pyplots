review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using purple/yellow/blue instead of red/yellow/green
  - Clean implementation of Highcharts native gauge chart with proper pane configuration
  - Value display (72) is prominent and clearly readable at 64px
  - Three-zone color bands correctly implemented at specified thresholds
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific dial and pivot styling options
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas sizing with appropriate font scaling
  weaknesses:
  - Tick labels on outer edge could be slightly larger (28px may be small for 4800px
    canvas)
  - Title format uses middle dot separators correctly but position could be higher
    for better spacing
