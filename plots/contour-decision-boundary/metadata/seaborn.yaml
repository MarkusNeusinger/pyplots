review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent decision boundary visualization with clear class separation using make_moons
    data
  - Comprehensive legend showing class regions, correctly classified points, and misclassified
    points with distinct markers
  - Accuracy metric displayed prominently in upper-left corner adds value
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot for training points overlay with appropriate styling
  - Clean color scheme with blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) provides good contrast
    and accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (Feature X1/X2 rather than describing the specific feature
    dimensions)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a decision boundary visualization for a 2-class
    SVM classifier trained on make_moons data. The feature space is divided into two
    colored regions: a blue region (Class 0) on the left/top portion and a yellow
    region (Class 1) on the right/bottom portion. A dark blue curved line marks the
    decision boundary between the two classes. Training points are overlaid as circular
    markers - blue circles for Class 0 and yellow circles for Class 1. Misclassified
    points are shown with red X markers with red edges, clustered primarily near the
    decision boundary where the two moon shapes overlap. The title "contour-decision-boundary
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, axis labels show "Feature X1" and
    "Feature X2", and an "SVM Accuracy: 94.0%" box is displayed in the upper-left
    corner. A comprehensive legend in the upper-right explains all visual elements.'
