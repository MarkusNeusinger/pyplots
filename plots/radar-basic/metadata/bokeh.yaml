review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent radar chart implementation with proper polar-to-cartesian coordinate
    conversion
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.25) for overlapping polygon visibility as spec
    requires
  - Smart text alignment logic for category labels based on position around the circle
  - 'Clean color scheme with Python colors (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B) that are
    distinguishable'
  - Proper square aspect ratio (3600x3600) for radar chart symmetry
  - Grid circles at correct intervals (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) as spec requests
  weaknesses:
  - Grid scale values (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) are not labeled on the chart, making it
    harder to read exact values
  - Legend is positioned in corner far from the chart - could be integrated better
  - No hover interactivity despite Bokeh being an interactive library
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/spider chart comparing two employees
    across 6 competency dimensions: Communication, Technical Skills, Teamwork, Problem
    Solving, Leadership, and Creativity. Employee A is represented by a blue polygon
    with blue markers, Employee B by a yellow/gold polygon with darker gold markers.
    The chart has 5 concentric grid circles (representing 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 scale)
    in light gray. Six axis lines extend from the center to each category label. The
    title "radar-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend in
    the top-right corner identifies the two employees. Both polygons are filled with
    ~25% alpha transparency, allowing overlap visibility. The chart uses a square
    1:1 aspect ratio with clean white background.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, Legend with LegendItem, patch for filled polygons.
          Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like hover tooltips or interactive
          callbacks
