review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of consistent color families per department with darker inner ring
    and lighter outer variations
  - Clean hierarchical data structure with proper aggregation from outer to inner
    ring
  - Good visual separation between rings using white stroke and radius gap
  - Appropriate use of Altair layered chart composition
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with sensible values
  - Smart label filtering showing only segments >=100 to avoid clutter
  weaknesses:
  - Outer ring labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full size
  - No explicit legend for smaller segments that do not have labels
  - The Engineering label in the inner ring slightly clips at the edge of its segment
