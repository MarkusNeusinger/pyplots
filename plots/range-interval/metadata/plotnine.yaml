review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_linerange combined with geom_point markers at endpoints
    - idiomatic plotnine/ggplot2 approach
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Color scheme provides strong visual contrast and accessibility
  - Data tells a clear seasonal temperature story
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling only shows horizontal lines; vertical grid lines removed entirely
  - Endpoint markers (size=4) are slightly small relative to the thick line ranges
    (size=8)
  - Could use Brewer palettes or other plotnine-native color scales instead of hardcoded
    hex colors
  image_description: The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges. Each month (Jan-Dec) is represented on the x-axis, with temperature in
    °C on the y-axis (ranging from approximately 2°C to 30°C). Blue vertical bars
    (geom_linerange) show the temperature range for each month, with yellow circular
    markers at both the minimum and maximum endpoints. The chart follows a clear seasonal
    pattern with narrower ranges in winter months (Jan, Feb, Dec) and wider ranges
    in summer months (Jun, Jul, Aug). The title "range-interval · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top. The background is minimal with a light gray theme and
    horizontal grid lines only.
