review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native drilldown module with proper breadcrumb configuration
  - Well-structured hierarchical data with realistic company revenue breakdown
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between slices
  - Proper data labels showing both absolute values and percentages
  - Interactive HTML version saved alongside PNG for full drilldown functionality
  - Good accessibility configuration with announceNewData and valueSuffix
  weaknesses:
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the core drilldown interactivity (inherent limitation)
  - Legend positioned far right could be closer to the chart for better visual grouping
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart showing "Company Revenue by Department"
    with 5 slices. The title "pie-drilldown · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top with a subtitle indicating click-to-drill-down functionality. The slices
    are colored: dark blue (Engineering: $4,500,000, 34.6%), golden yellow (Sales:
    $3,200,000, 24.6%), purple (Marketing: $1,800,000, 13.8%), cyan (Operations: $2,100,000,
    16.2%), and brown (Research: $1,400,000, 10.8%). Data labels with name, dollar
    value, and percentage are positioned outside each slice with connector lines.
    A vertical legend on the right lists all departments with color indicators. The
    pie chart is well-sized and centered, using approximately 50-60% of the canvas
    area.'
