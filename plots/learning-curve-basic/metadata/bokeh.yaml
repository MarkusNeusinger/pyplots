review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper use of Bokeh's Band model for confidence intervals
  - Interactive HoverTool provides detailed information on hover (training vs validation,
    exact values, std range)
  - Good color scheme using Python's signature blue (#306998) and complementary orange
    (#E6A800)
  - Proper ColumnDataSource usage for both data series
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) preserves Bokeh's interactive capabilities
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in bottom-right corner could be moved closer to the curves (e.g.,
    top_left inside plot area would be near the training curve)
  - Text sizes, while adequate, are on the lower end for the 4800x2700 canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a model learning curve with two distinct lines
    on a light gray background. The **blue line** (Training Score) remains consistently
    high at approximately 0.97-0.98 across all training set sizes, with a narrow light
    blue confidence band. The **orange/yellow line** (Validation Score) starts at
    around 0.68 for small training sets and curves upward asymptotically, reaching
    approximately 0.89 at 900 samples, with a wider yellow confidence band that narrows
    as sample size increases. The title "learning-curve-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. The x-axis is labeled "Training Set Size (samples)" (range
    50-900) and the y-axis is labeled "Accuracy Score" (range 0.6-1.0). A legend in
    the bottom-right corner identifies both curves. The grid uses dashed lines with
    subtle alpha.

        comment: Uses HoverTool for interactivity (good), Band for confidence intervals,
          ColumnDataSource. HTML output preserved. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific
          features.
  verdict: APPROVED
