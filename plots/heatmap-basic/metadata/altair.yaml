review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging colormap (blueorange) with domainMid=50 to center the
    color scale
  - Smart conditional text coloring (white on dark cells, black on light cells) for
    optimal readability
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax combining heatmap + text layers
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity in HTML export
  - Well-proportioned 8x8 matrix with clear diagonal pattern demonstrating heatmap
    utility
  weaknesses:
  - Data could include negative values to fully showcase the diverging colormap potential
  - Generic row/column labels (Row A, Col 1) could be more realistic (e.g., correlation
    matrix with variable names)
  - X-axis labels appear slightly rotated which is unnecessary for short labels
