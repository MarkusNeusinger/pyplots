review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual hierarchy with excellent text sizing at all levels (title, axis labels,
    ticks)
  - 'Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics: layered geoms, annotations, and
    theme customization'
  - The yellow dashed vertical line with annotation clearly highlights the optimal
    k value
  - Clean, professional appearance using theme_minimal with subtle grid
  - Good color contrast between the blue data line and yellow annotation
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows decimal values (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0) instead of integers (1, 2, 3,
    ..., 10) which would be more appropriate for discrete k values
  - The realistic context is somewhat generic - could use a more specific domain scenario
