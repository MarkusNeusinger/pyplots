review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper KISS structure and reproducibility
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.6) to show point density
  - Horizontal reference line at y=0 implemented with dashed styling
  - Outliers are clearly visible demonstrating diagnostic capability
  - Color scheme is accessible and professional
  weaknesses:
  - Marker dots appear slightly small for 100 data points at 4800x2700 resolution;
    could increase dots_size
  - Legend positioned in top-left corner could potentially overlap with outlier data
    points
  - Y-axis range is stretched due to outliers, creating some visual imbalance
  - Font sizes in the custom style are quite large but the rendered output appears
    smaller than expected
