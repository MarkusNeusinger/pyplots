review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and clean layout
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (box plot inside violin, median
    line, mirrored density)
  - Realistic salary distribution data that demonstrates violin plot advantages (different
    spreads, means)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses two similar blues and two similar yellows which slightly reduces
    category distinction
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates
  - Data could include one bimodal distribution to better showcase violin plot capabilities
    over box plots
