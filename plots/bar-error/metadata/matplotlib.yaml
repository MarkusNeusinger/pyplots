review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for all elements
  - Clear, realistic A/B test scenario with plausible conversion rate data
  - Error bar caps are clearly visible with good sizing (capsize=10, capthick=3)
  - Clean annotation explaining what error bars represent (95% CI requirement from
    spec)
  - Good color choice with consistent dark blue theme
  - KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars are all symmetric; demonstrating asymmetric errors would better showcase
    the plot type capabilities
  - Annotation box placement in bottom-right corner floats in empty space rather than
    being more integrated with the plot
  - Basic library usage without leveraging advanced matplotlib features like bar_label()
    for showing values
