review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of sparkline minimalism with proper removal of all chart
    chrome (axes, ticks, gridlines, legend)
  - Smart use of colored markers to highlight min (red), max (green), and first/last
    (blue) points
  - Perfect aspect ratio (4:1) achieved with figure_size=(16, 4)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of plotnine theme system to strip away all unnecessary elements
  weaknesses:
  - Line could be slightly thinner for a more authentic sparkline appearance at very
    small sizes
