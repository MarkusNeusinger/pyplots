review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the silhouette plot using plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Clean use of geom_segment for horizontal bars with proper aesthetics
  - Well-annotated with cluster averages and overall average line
  - Uses real iris dataset for meaningful demonstration
  - Proper font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/green)
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: annotation positioning extends into negative x territory'
  - No negative silhouette values shown to demonstrate misclassification aspect
  image_description: 'The plot displays a silhouette plot with three clusters (Cluster
    0, 1, and 2) from the iris dataset clustering. Horizontal bars represent individual
    samples'' silhouette coefficients, sorted within each cluster. Cluster 0 (blue)
    is at the bottom with avg: 0.42, Cluster 1 (yellow/gold) is in the middle with
    avg: 0.80, and Cluster 2 (green) is at the top with avg: 0.45. A vertical red
    dashed line marks the overall average silhouette score (0.55) with a label "Avg:
    0.55". The title follows the correct format: "silhouette-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai".
    The x-axis shows "Silhouette Coefficient" (0.0 to 0.8 visible range), and the
    y-axis is labeled "Sample Index (sorted within cluster)" but tick marks are hidden.
    Each cluster is annotated with its name and average score on the left side. A
    legend on the right identifies the three clusters by color.'
