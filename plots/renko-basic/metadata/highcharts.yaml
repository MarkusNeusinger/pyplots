quality_score: 87
review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Renko brick calculation algorithm with proper price tracking
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean separation of bullish/bearish series with borders
  - Proper HTML export with inline scripts for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Good use of subtitle to show brick size parameter
  weaknesses:
  - Uses red-green color scheme which fails colorblind accessibility - should use
    colorblind-safe alternatives like blue/orange or blue/red with different saturations
  - Does not leverage Highcharts stock module or specialized financial chart features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart showing stock price movements
    using columnrange bars. Green bricks represent bullish (upward) price movements
    and red bricks represent bearish (downward) movements. The chart shows approximately
    70 bricks tracking price from around $86 to $114. The title reads "renko-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Stock Price Movement | Brick Size:
    $2". The X-axis is labeled "Brick Index" (0-70) and Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from $84 to $116 with dollar sign formatting. A legend in the top-right corner
    identifies "Bullish (Up)" in green and "Bearish (Down)" in red. Subtle grid lines
    help identify price levels. The chart clearly shows trend patterns with extended
    runs of same-direction bricks followed by reversals.'
