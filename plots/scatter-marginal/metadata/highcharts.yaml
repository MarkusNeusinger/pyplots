review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent axis alignment between main scatter and marginal histograms
  - Good use of multi-chart composition to achieve the marginal distribution layout
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with appropriate temperature/humidity correlation
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme with consistent styling across all chart panels
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Top-right corner is empty white space that could be utilized better
  - Could use Highcharts chart linking features for synchronized crosshairs/tooltips
  - Library version in header shows unknown instead of actual version
