review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements (24/20/16pt)
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: shows central line with shaded confidence band exactly
    as specified'
  - Realistic data scenario (monthly sales forecast) with growing uncertainty over
    time
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of contrasting but related colors (dark blue line, light blue band)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between instead of seaborn native confidence interval features
    (sns.lineplot can compute CI automatically from raw data)
  - Legend position slightly overlaps with early confidence band data
