review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizon chart implementation with proper band folding technique showing
    positive (blue) and negative (red) values
  - Good use of subplots for multiple series comparison with shared x-axis
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color intensity progression (light to dark)
    for magnitude encoding
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic server CPU monitoring scenario with 6 servers over 24 hours
  - Good legend annotation explaining color interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Series labels (Server A-F) could be larger for better readability at full resolution
  - X-axis tick font size (16) is slightly below optimal for 4800x2700 output
  - Color legend annotation text is small and could be more prominent
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizon chart with 6 server CPU load time
    series (Server A through Server F) arranged vertically as subplots over a 24-hour
    period. Each series uses the horizon chart folding technique: positive deviations
    from baseline are shown in blue (light to dark shades indicating increasing magnitude
    across 3 bands), while negative deviations are shown in red (light to dark). The
    title reads "Server CPU Load (24h) · horizon-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered
    at the top. The x-axis shows "Hour of Day" from 0 to ~24, with tick marks at 0,
    5, 10, 15, 20. Series labels appear on the left side of each subplot. A color
    interpretation legend is positioned in the top-right corner. The layout uses a
    clean white background with no gridlines, and each series row has consistent height.'
