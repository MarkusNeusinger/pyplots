review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed packing simulation implemented inline - bubbles are tightly
    packed without overlap
  - Correct area-based scaling (sqrt transformation) for accurate visual perception
    of values
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with good visual separation between divisions
  - Appropriate use of theme_void for packed bubble charts where axes are meaningless
  - Labels abbreviated intelligently to fit inside bubbles
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows Division but could show bubble size scale to help interpret values
  - Some smaller bubbles (QA, Legal, Security) have labels that are slightly cramped
  - Does not utilize lets-plot interactive tooltip features which would be valuable
    for this chart type
