review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of interactive range selector buttons using Bokeh CustomJS
    callbacks
  - Realistic stock price data with proper random walk generation showing upward drift
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource pattern and Range1d for dynamic range manipulation
  - Correct implementation of all 6 required buttons with visual highlighting for
    active state
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - HoverTool provides additional interactivity in HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - Button labels in the PNG output appear very small and hard to read at the displayed
    size
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent; could use more subtle alpha
  - Legend label Daily Price could be more descriptive
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series line chart showing daily stock-like
    price data from January 2022 to January 2025 (approximately 3 years). The main
    chart area shows a blue line (#306998) representing price movements ranging from
    approximately $80 to $240. At the top of the visualization, there are 6 range
    selector buttons arranged horizontally: "1M", "3M", "6M", "YTD", "1Y", and "All"
    - with the "All" button highlighted in blue (primary style) indicating it is the
    currently selected range. The x-axis shows dates labeled at 6-month intervals
    (Jan 2022, Jul 2022, Jan 2023, etc.) with the label "Date". The y-axis shows "Price
    ($)" with values from 80 to 240. A legend in the top-left reads "Daily Price".
    The line shows realistic stock behavior with upward drift, periods of consolidation,
    and volatility.'

        comment: Good use of ColumnDataSource, CustomJS callbacks for interactivity,
          Button widgets, Range1d for dynamic x-range, HoverTool, DatetimeTickFormatter.
          However, the interactive features are the main strength of Bokeh and they
          shine in the HTML output rather than static PNG
