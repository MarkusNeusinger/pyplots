# chessboard-basic: Chess Board Grid Visualization

## Description

A classic 8x8 chess board with alternating light and dark squares, labeled with standard algebraic notation (columns a-h, rows 1-8). This clean grid visualization serves as a foundation for chess diagrams, game position displays, and educational chess materials.

## Applications

- Chess game analysis and position diagrams for players and coaches
- Educational materials for learning chess notation and board orientation
- Game documentation and move visualization in chess publications
- Interactive chess applications and puzzle displays

## Data

- `rows` (integer) - Fixed at 8 rows (labeled 1-8)
- `columns` (integer) - Fixed at 8 columns (labeled a-h)
- Size: 64 squares (8x8 grid)
- Example: Standard chess board with white square at h1

## Notes

- Light squares traditionally appear at h1 and a8 corners
- Column labels (a-h) appear at bottom, row labels (1-8) appear on left side
- Color scheme should use classic light/dark contrast (e.g., cream/brown or white/gray)
- Square borders optional but can enhance clarity
- Board should maintain 1:1 aspect ratio for proper square proportions
