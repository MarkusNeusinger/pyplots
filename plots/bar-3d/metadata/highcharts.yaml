review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts 3D rendering with proper alpha/beta viewing angles
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette that distinguishes all four quarters effectively
  - Professional title format and descriptive subtitle explaining the data context
  - Proper use of z-axis configuration for depth dimension
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good data generation logic
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - The z-axis Quarter label appears isolated at bottom-right corner of the chart
  - Some bars in the back are partially occluded by taller front bars - transparency
    could help
  - The interactive HTML version could include drag-to-rotate functionality for better
    exploration
