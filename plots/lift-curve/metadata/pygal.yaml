review:
  strengths:
  - 'Clean, professional visualization with appropriate pyplots color scheme (#306998
    blue, #FFD43B yellow)'
  - Correct lift curve implementation showing model performance vs baseline
  - Excellent realistic data scenario (customer response prediction) that matches
    spec applications
  - Good use of pygal style customization with custom Style configuration
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas size with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output leveraging pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Legend font appears relatively small compared to axis labels
  - Missing value annotations at key decile points as suggested in spec
  - Does not fully leverage pygal interactive tooltip features
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve visualization on a white background.
    A blue line labeled "Model Lift" starts at approximately 1.68 lift at the 10%
    population mark and gradually decreases, approaching the baseline of 1.0 as it
    reaches 100% of the population. Each decile point is marked with a visible dot.
    A yellow horizontal line at y=1 represents "Random (No Lift)" as the baseline
    reference. The title "lift-curve · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The
    X-axis is labeled "Population Targeted (%)" with decile markers (10% through 100%),
    and the Y-axis is labeled "Lift (Model Rate / Baseline Rate)" with a range from
    0.9 to 2.2. The legend is positioned at the bottom with two entries. The overall
    layout is clean with good use of canvas space.
