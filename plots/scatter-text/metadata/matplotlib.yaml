review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent concept: programming languages as named entities in embedding space
    is creative and immediately understandable'
  - Clean color scheme with four distinct, colorblind-friendly colors
  - Legend correctly explains categories with appropriate patch styling
  - Proper axis labels and title format following spec requirements
  - Good code structure following KISS principles with seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Text overlap in dense regions (around x=2-3, y=5-5.5) makes some labels hard to
    read
  - Yellow text (#FFD43B) has reduced contrast against white background
  - Font size of 14 could be increased to 16-18 for better legibility at 4800x2700
    resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot where programming language
    names serve as data points instead of traditional markers, positioned on a 2D
    embedding space. The title "scatter-text · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in appropriate font size. X-axis labeled "Embedding Dimension 1" (range
    0-8) and Y-axis labeled "Embedding Dimension 2" (range 0-7.5). Languages are color-coded
    by category: blue (#306998) for Dynamic/Scripting (Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.),
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Functional (Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, etc.), teal (#4ECDC4)
    for Systems (C++, Go, Rust, Zig, etc.), and coral (#FF6B6B) for JVM-based (Java,
    Kotlin, Scala, Groovy). A legend in the upper right clearly explains the color
    mapping. Grid lines are subtle (dashed, alpha). Languages cluster logically: functional
    languages cluster top-left, systems languages spread along the right side. Some
    text overlap is visible in the dense center region (around coordinates 2-3, 5)
    where "Python", "F#", "Crystal", "Julia" overlap.'
