review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot with cumulative=True and stat=proportion for
    native cumulative histogram support
  - Realistic web API response time scenario perfectly demonstrates percentile analysis
    use case
  - Well-designed percentile reference lines with both horizontal and vertical markers
    make it easy to read threshold values
  - Clean annotation styling with white background boxes and colored borders for excellent
    readability
  - Good color progression for percentile lines (yellow to orange to red) indicating
    increasing severity
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: The grid lines could be further reduced (alpha 0.2) as they compete slightly
    with the percentile reference lines'
  - 'Minor: Right-side whitespace after data ends (~500ms) could be reduced by setting
    xlim closer to the actual data range'
