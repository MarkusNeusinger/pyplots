review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the bump chart concept with proper Y-axis inversion
  - Smart use of direct labeling (geom_text) instead of legend for cleaner visualization
  - Well-chosen Set2 color palette provides good distinction and colorblind accessibility
  - Data tells a compelling story with varied ranking patterns (leader Alpha Corp,
    volatile Gamma Tech, stable underperformer Epsilon Labs)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha) for a cleaner look
  - Axis labels are functional but could be more descriptive
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing tech company rankings
    over 6 quarters (Q1-Q6). Five companies are tracked: Alpha Corp (teal), Gamma
    Tech (green), Beta Inc (coral/salmon), Delta Systems (blue/periwinkle), and Epsilon
    Labs (pink). The Y-axis shows ranks 1-5 with rank 1 at the top (inverted). Lines
    connect each company''s rank across quarters with dot markers at each data point.
    Company names appear as labels on the right side at their final Q6 positions.
    The title "bump-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The background
    is minimal with a subtle grid.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar properly with geom_line, geom_point, geom_text,
          scale_y_reverse, theme customization; solid plotnine usage but no advanced
          features like faceting
  verdict: APPROVED
