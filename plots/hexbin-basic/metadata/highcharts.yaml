review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis color palette with custom stops for perceptual uniformity
  - Clean well-structured code with manual hex binning preserving density concept
  - Realistic seismic monitoring data context with three distinct activity zones
  - Good visual refinement with hidden axes, subtle hex borders, disabled credits/tooltips
  - Proper Selenium screenshot workflow with inline JS for headless Chrome
  weaknesses:
  - Axes completely hidden with no spatial reference for interpreting coordinates
  - Grid coordinates displayed instead of original data values
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python SDK
  - Data storytelling relies on colormap alone without zone labels or emphasis
  - Low-density areas lack differentiation in dark purple range
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal tilemap representing "Seismic
    Activity Density" on a white background. The title "Seismic Activity Density ·
    hexbin-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in medium-weight 44px
    text. Hexagonal bins are colored using a viridis-like gradient defined with custom
    stops: dark purple (#440154) for low density, transitioning through blue (#3b528b),
    teal (#21918c), green (#5ec962), to bright yellow (#fde725) for high density.
    Three density clusters are visible: an upper-center zone in green/teal tones,
    a lower-right zone with the brightest yellow and green hexagons representing the
    highest event counts (~350), and a broader lower-left zone in mostly dark purple
    indicating low density. A vertical color axis legend labeled "Event Count" is
    positioned on the right side, ranging from 0 to approximately 350. No x/y axis
    labels or tick marks are present — axes are completely hidden. Hexagons have subtle
    white borders (rgba(255,255,255,0.3)) separating them. Some isolated hexagons
    appear at the far edges of the distribution.'

        comment: Highcharts tilemap with hexagon tileShape is the closest native approach.
          Manual Python binning preserves hex aggregation. Grid indices shown instead
          of original coordinates.
