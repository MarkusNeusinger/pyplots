review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar coordinates in Altair despite lack of native
    polar support
  - Clean manual construction of polar gridlines (circles and spokes) as separate
    chart layers
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Realistic wind data with meaningful prevailing directions and appropriate speed
    distributions
  - Well-formatted direction labels with both cardinal names and degree values
  weaknesses:
  - Missing traditional axis labels - while direction/radius labels exist, could add
    descriptive text like Wind Speed (m/s) near radius labels
  - Does not leverage Altair interactive features (zoom, pan, brush selection) which
    are a key library strength
  - Some point overlap in dense clusters could be improved with slightly smaller markers
    or stronger alpha
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar scatter chart of wind observations
    on a square canvas. Four concentric gray circles mark radii at 5, 10, 15, and
    20 m/s. Eight radial spokes extend from the center at 45° intervals, labeled with
    cardinal/intercardinal directions and degree values (e.g., "N (90°)", "SE (315°)").
    Data points are colored by time of day: blue for Morning, yellow for Afternoon,
    and coral/pink for Evening. The Morning (blue) points cluster strongly in the
    SE quadrant with higher speeds, the Afternoon (yellow) points cluster in the NW
    quadrant with moderate-to-high speeds, and Evening (coral) points are scattered
    more diffusely with lower speeds. The title "Wind Observations · polar-scatter
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center, and a legend in the upper right
    shows the "Time of Day" categories.'
