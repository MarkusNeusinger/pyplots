review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine native style="left-right" parameter for true split violins
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic and meaningful data scenario (employee satisfaction before/after training)
  - Perfect title format and clear axis labels with units
  - Colorblind-accessible color palette (blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines makes it harder to read exact values from the violins
  - Could benefit from inner quartile markers or box plots as suggested in spec notes
