review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent physics application with analytically correct damped harmonic oscillator
    equations
  - Three distinct trajectories from different initial conditions clearly demonstrate
    basin of attraction
  - Fixed point marked prominently with distinctive red diamond marker
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple) provides good visual distinction
  - Interactive HTML version also saved for exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Position x (m)" and "Velocity dx/dt (m/s)")
  - Specification suggests adding direction arrows or color gradient to show time
    evolution - not implemented
  - Y-axis tick labels are somewhat crowded with 0.25 increments
