review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data choice that clearly demonstrates density histogram purpose
  - Clean layering of histogram with density curve overlay
  - Proper density normalization using y=..density..
  - Good color contrast between blue histogram and yellow density line
  - Appropriate figure sizing and text scaling for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Uses deprecated ..density.. syntax instead of modern after_stat(density)
  - Grid styling incorrectly uses element_text for panel_grid_major_y (should be element_line)
  - Axis labels lack units where applicable
  image_description: The plot displays a density histogram showing a bimodal distribution
    of test scores. Blue bars (#306998) with white edges represent the histogram bins,
    normalized to show density on the y-axis. A smooth yellow/gold density curve (#FFD43B)
    is overlaid on the histogram, clearly showing two peaks around scores of 65 and
    85. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score" ranging from approximately 40 to 100, and
    the y-axis shows "Density" from 0.00 to about 0.035. The title correctly reads
    "histogram-density · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The plot uses a minimal theme with
    subtle grid lines and good use of whitespace.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_histogram and geom_density overlay,
          theme_minimal, but could leverage more plotnine-specific features like scale
          adjustments
  verdict: APPROVED
