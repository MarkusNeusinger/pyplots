review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging colormap (blue-white-yellow) that is colorblind-safe
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean and readable correlation matrix with appropriate annotation formatting
  - Good use of square aspect ratio (3600×3600) ideal for correlation matrices
  - Proper numeric formatting (2 decimal places) for correlation values
  - Realistic financial indicators context for the correlation data
  - White cell borders provide clear visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw JSON/JavaScript approach instead of highcharts-core Python library as
    documented in prompts/library/highcharts.md
  - Annotation font size could be slightly larger for better readability at a distance
  - Colorbar legend labels are small relative to the chart size
