review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clearly distinguishable thick (3×3 box) and thin
    (cell) lines
  - Numbers are large, bold, and perfectly centered using Arial Black font
  - Clean monochrome design ideal for printing as specified
  - Uses proper square aspect ratio (1:1) appropriate for Sudoku
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs, leveraging Plotly dual-output capability
  - Real, solvable Sudoku puzzle data rather than random numbers
  weaknesses:
  - Output size 3600×3600 differs from standard 4800×2700 landscape format (though
    square is appropriate for Sudoku)
  - Could add subtle hover tooltips showing cell coordinates to leverage Plotly interactivity
  - Thin line width (1.5) could be slightly thicker (2.0) for better print visibility
    at smaller sizes
