review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using XY chart with manual arrow construction (shaft + arrowhead
    lines)
  - Proper circular rotation pattern demonstrating vector field behavior
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  - Good use of the 4800x2700 canvas size with appropriate styling
  - Arrows properly scaled by magnitude with arrowheads showing direction
  weaknesses:
  - Arrows are thin and the blue color is subtle, making the visualization less impactful
  - No color encoding for magnitude (optional per spec but would enhance the visualization)
  - Data context is abstract mathematical rather than a real-world application
  - Font sizes could be larger for better readability at this resolution
