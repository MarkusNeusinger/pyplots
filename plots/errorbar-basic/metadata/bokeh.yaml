review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's Whisker and TeeHead components for professional error
    bar caps
  - Clean implementation using ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Demonstrates asymmetric error bars as mentioned in the spec
  - Realistic experimental scenario with control and treatment groups
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good use of grid styling with dashed lines and appropriate alpha
  weaknesses:
  - Text sizes could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas (title 36pt is good,
    but axis labels at 28pt could be 32pt)
  - The Bokeh toolbar in the corner adds visual clutter to the static PNG output
