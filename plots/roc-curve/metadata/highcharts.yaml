review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of AreaSeries with gradient fill to visually represent the AUC area
    under the ROC curve
  - Clean implementation following the library rules for Highcharts with inline JS
    embedding
  - Proper manual ROC curve calculation demonstrating the algorithm
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (Python Blue and olive yellow)
  - Correctly formatted title following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position causes slight overlap with the x-axis 1 tick label
  - Could leverage Highcharts tooltip feature to show threshold values at each point
    on the curve
  - Example data shows only one high-performing classifier; could include comparison
    with a second model to better demonstrate ROC curve usage
  image_description: 'The plot shows a ROC curve on a white background. The main ROC
    curve is displayed as a blue area chart (Python Blue #306998) with a gradient
    fill from darker blue at the top to lighter blue at the bottom, representing the
    area under the curve. The curve shows excellent classifier performance, starting
    near the top-left and reaching the top quickly. A dashed olive/yellow diagonal
    line represents the random classifier reference (y=x). The title "roc-curve ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The subtitle "Binary Classifier
    Performance" is shown below. The X-axis is labeled "False Positive Rate" (0 to
    1), Y-axis is labeled "True Positive Rate" (0 to 1). A legend in the bottom-right
    shows "ROC Curve (AUC = 0.967)" and "Random Classifier (AUC = 0.5)". Grid lines
    are subtle light gray. The layout fills the canvas well with proper margins.'
