review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with excellent text legibility
  - Correct ECDF implementation with proper step function
  - Perfect title format following spec requirements
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with theme customization
  - Appropriate figure sizing (16x9) and DPI (300)
  weaknesses:
  - Manual ECDF computation instead of using plotnine native stat_ecdf() which would
    be more idiomatic
  - Axis label Values is generic and lacks units or more descriptive context
  image_description: The plot displays an ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) as a blue step function on a clean minimal background. The title "ecdf-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is positioned at the top center. The x-axis is labeled
    "Values" and shows data ranging from approximately 0 to 90, with tick marks at
    25, 50, and 75. The y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" with values from
    0.0 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments. The step function shows a classic S-shaped cumulative
    distribution, starting near 0 on the left and rising to 1.0 on the right, with
    the steepest increase around the median value of 50. Light gray grid lines aid
    in reading values. The blue color (#306998) provides good contrast against the
    white background.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3), but no legend needed for single series
          - minor deduction for grid being slightly less visible than optimal

        comment: Uses plotnine's ggplot grammar correctly with geom_step, theme_minimal,
          and proper element_text styling; however, could leverage stat_ecdf() for
          native ECDF computation instead of manual calculation
  verdict: APPROVED
