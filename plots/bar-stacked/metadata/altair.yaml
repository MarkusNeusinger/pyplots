review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (O, Q,
    N)
  - Clean stacking implementation using Order encoding with custom sort
  - White stroke separators enhance segment visibility
  - Tooltips provide interactive data exploration
  - Well-configured axis and legend font sizes for readability
  - Realistic quarterly sales data with meaningful variation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing total value labels above each stack (mentioned in spec as consideration)
  - Could use a more colorblind-optimized palette
  - Legend configuration could be refined
