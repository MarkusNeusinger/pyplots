  strengths:
  - Excellent gradient fill using Altair's native alt.Gradient() with GradientStop
    — a distinctive and visually appealing feature
  - Strong data storytelling with the marketing campaign spike annotation (red circle
    + bold label)
  - Realistic, well-crafted data with weekly patterns, growth trend, and spike — demonstrates
    area chart capabilities fully
  - All font sizes explicitly set to appropriate values for the output resolution
  - Dual output (PNG + interactive HTML) leverages Altair's strength as a Vega-Lite
    wrapper
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code using declarative layer composition
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label 'Daily Visitors' lacks units (could be 'Daily Visitors (count)' for
    full VQ-06 marks)
  - Annotation font size (16pt) is slightly below the recommended minimum for tick
    text, though still readable at full resolution
  - Could benefit from additional visual refinement such as custom background color
    or weekend shading to enhance the weekly pattern narrative
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 days). The area is filled with a linear gradient transitioning
    from nearly transparent at the bottom (rgba 0.05 opacity) to a more opaque blue
    near the line (rgba 0.45 opacity). The line itself is a solid Python Blue (#306998)
    with a stroke width of 2.5. The X-axis shows dates from Jan 01 to Jan 29 with
    labels angled at -30 degrees. The Y-axis shows "Daily Visitors" ranging from 0
    to approximately 11,000. The title "area-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in large font. A prominent red circle marks the Jan 15 traffic spike
    (~9,300 visitors) with bold red text "Marketing campaign spike" as an annotation.
    The data exhibits a clear weekly pattern with dips on weekends, an upward growth
    trend, and realistic noise. Gridlines are present but subtle (0.2 opacity), and
    the chart frame/border is removed for a clean look.
