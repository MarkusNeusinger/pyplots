review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent wind rose visualization with properly stacked bars for three wind speed
    categories
  - Clean polar layout with N correctly positioned at top using rotation=90 and clockwise
    direction
  - Good color scheme with white bar separators enhancing readability
  - Proper use of Plotly Barpolar trace for polar bar charts
  - Realistic coastal wind pattern data with believable directional distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis tick labels are slightly small and angled, could be larger for better
    legibility
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive features like custom hover templates
  - Legend text could benefit from slightly better styling to match overall polish
