review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of LOWESS algorithm from scratch with proper tricube
    weighting
  - Clear visual distinction between scatter points (blue, transparent) and LOWESS
    curve (yellow, solid line)
  - Perfect title format and professional plotly_white template
  - Good font sizes throughout ensuring readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Well-chosen smoothing fraction (0.3) that captures the trend without overfitting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or more descriptive context (e.g., could use domain-specific
    labels)
  - Manual LOWESS implementation is educational but verbose; could leverage statsmodels
    for production code
