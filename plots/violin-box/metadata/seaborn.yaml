review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing four distinct distribution shapes (normal, bimodal,
    right-skewed, left-skewed) that perfectly demonstrate the value of violin plots
  - Clean use of seaborn inner=box parameter for embedded box plots
  - Modern API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Professional color palette with good contrast and accessibility
  - Appropriate font sizes and clear labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only on y-axis, though acceptable for categorical x-axis
  - Legend disabled which is fine since batch names are on x-axis, but a small legend
    could enhance standalone viewing
