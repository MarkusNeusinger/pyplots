review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of the spec-required features: percentage labels on slices, distinct
    colorblind-safe colors, legend, and slight explosion on Engineering slice for
    emphasis'
  - Clean, professional appearance with white slice borders adding visual separation
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that clearly demonstrates parts-to-whole
    relationship
  - Proper use of plotly graph_objects API with appropriate sizing (4800x2700)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with more whitespace on left side compared to right
    where legend is positioned
  - Could use plotly hovertemplate for richer interactivity in the HTML version
  - Slice size distribution is fairly uniform (35/25/20/12/8) - more extreme variation
    would better demonstrate the plot type ability to show disparate proportions
