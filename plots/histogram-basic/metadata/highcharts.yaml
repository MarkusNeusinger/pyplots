review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent histogram representation with no gaps between bars (pointPadding: 0,
    groupPadding: 0)'
  - Clear bell-curve distribution that demonstrates the purpose of a histogram
  - Well-formatted title following the required format
  - Good use of rotated X-axis labels to prevent overlap
  - Proper Y-axis starting at zero for accurate visual comparison
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label "Value Range" could be more descriptive with units (e.g., "Score
    Range" or context-specific label)
  - Data is purely generic normal distribution without a specific real-world context
    in the visualization
  - Could leverage Highcharts tooltips or data labels for enhanced interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram showing a normal distribution centered
    around 65. The chart uses a solid blue color (#306998) for the bars with a darker
    blue border. The title "histogram-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in large bold text. The Y-axis is labeled "Frequency" and ranges from
    0 to 102. The X-axis shows bin ranges (e.g., 16-23, 23-31, ..., 116-123) with
    labels rotated at approximately 315 degrees. The bars have no gaps between them,
    correctly representing histogram bins. The distribution peaks at the 66-73 bin
    with a frequency of ~96, showing a classic bell curve shape with 500 data points.
