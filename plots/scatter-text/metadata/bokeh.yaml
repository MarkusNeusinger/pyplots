review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of LabelSet for text-based scatter plot - idiomatic Bokeh approach
  - Well-designed clustering creates realistic embedding visualization
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  - Clean, readable code structure with thoughtful comments explaining clusters
  weaknesses:
  - Minor overlap between COBOL and Erlang labels could be improved with additional
    jitter
  - Axis labels lack units (though dimensionless is acceptable for embeddings)
  - Could leverage HoverTool for interactive exploration in HTML output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with text labels instead of
    markers, showing 30 programming language names positioned in a 2D embedding space.
    The title "scatter-text · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner.
    The x-axis is labeled "Embedding Dimension 1" (ranging from -4 to 6) and the y-axis
    is labeled "Embedding Dimension 2" (ranging from -6 to 4). All text labels are
    rendered in a blue color (#306998, Python Blue) with slight transparency. The
    labels are distributed across the canvas showing visible clustering patterns:
    systems languages (C++, Assembly, Rust, Swift, Go) in the upper-left, modern general-purpose
    languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript) in the upper-right, functional
    languages (Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, F#) in the lower-left to middle, and
    scientific/data languages (R, Julia, MATLAB, Ruby) in the lower portion. The background
    is a light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines. The layout effectively
    uses the canvas space and all labels are legible without significant overlap.'

        comment: All text labels readable at full size. Title 28pt, axis labels 22pt,
          tick labels 18pt, data labels 22pt - clear but could be slightly larger
          for optimal readability.
