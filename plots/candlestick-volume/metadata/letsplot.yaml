review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 70/30 vertical split matching spec requirements
  - Clean candlestick implementation using geom_segment for both wicks and bodies
  - Volume bars correctly color-coded to match candlestick direction
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot grammar and gggrid for combining plots
  - Realistic synthetic stock data with proper OHLC relationship
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Subtle grid lines that do not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green color scheme is not colorblind-safe; should use colorblind-friendly
    alternatives
  - Missing crosshair/cursor feature spanning both panes as specified in the requirements
  - No legend explaining what green and red colors represent (up/down days)
  - X-axis shows numeric index instead of actual dates which would be more meaningful
