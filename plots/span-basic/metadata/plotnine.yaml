review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_rect for span regions
  - Clean layering with spans drawn first so line appears on top
  - Realistic recession period scenario with stock price data
  - Both vertical (time-based) and horizontal (threshold-based) spans demonstrated
  - Proper figure sizing and text scaling for high-resolution output
  - Good color choices with meaningful legend
  weaknesses:
  - The horizontal Risk Zone span (60-80) does not intersect with the actual data
    (price range ~150-210), making it visually disconnected and less educational
  - Optional text labels within span regions (mentioned in spec notes) are not implemented
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing stock price over time
    (2006-2016) with two span regions highlighted. The title "span-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" is at the top. The x-axis shows "Year" and the y-axis shows "Price
    ($)". A blue line (#306998) traces stock price starting around $200 and declining
    to around $155. A yellow/cream vertical span marks the "Recession Period" (2008-2009),
    and a pink/salmon horizontal span at the bottom marks the "Risk Zone" (price range
    60-80). The legend on the right side shows "Highlighted Region" with both span
    types labeled. The background is clean with subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Shows both vertical and horizontal spans, but the horizontal span

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_rect for spans, proper layering, scale_fill_manual.
          Could have used annotate() for text labels within spans as mentioned in
          spec notes.
  verdict: APPROVED
