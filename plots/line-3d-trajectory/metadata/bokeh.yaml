review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of Lorenz attractor as example data - canonical chaotic system
    perfect for 3D trajectories
  - Creative 3D-to-2D projection with custom axis arrows and labels
  - Good use of Bokeh HoverTool showing original 3D coordinates at hover points
  - Viridis colormap with gradient line segments effectively shows time progression
  - Clean code structure with inline physics simulation
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar values show 0-1 instead of 0-15 seconds as specified in code (possible
    rendering mismatch)
  - Axis labels in rendered image appear simpler than code specifies
  image_description: The plot displays a Lorenz Attractor trajectory in a 3D-to-2D
    isometric projection. The characteristic butterfly wing pattern of the Lorenz
    system is clearly visible with two spiral lobes. The trajectory line uses a Viridis
    colormap gradient transitioning from dark purple (time=0) through blue, green,
    to yellow (time=1) to show temporal progression. Three coordinate axes (X, Y,
    Z) with arrowheads are drawn from the origin at the center of the plot. The colorbar
    on the right side shows "Time Progression" with values ranging from 0 to 1. The
    title "Lorenz Attractor · line-3d-trajectory · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top left. The background is a subtle off-white (#f9f9f9) with very faint dashed
    grid lines. The plot is well-centered with good use of the canvas space.
