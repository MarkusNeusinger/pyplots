review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly stackgroup with groupnorm=percent for proper 100% stacking
  - Clean professional visual appearance with well-sized fonts
  - Realistic energy market share scenario showing energy transition story
  - Good use of hovertemplate for informative tooltips
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  - Proper normalization logic in data preparation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order reversed from visual stacking order - Hydro first in legend but at
    top of stack
  - Two green shades (Hydro olive and Wind bright) may be difficult to distinguish
    for colorblind users
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing energy source
    market share evolution from 2015 to 2024. Five energy sources are represented:
    Coal (dark blue, bottom), Natural Gas (yellow/gold), Wind (bright green), Solar
    (magenta/pink), and Hydro (olive green, top). The chart clearly shows Coal declining
    from ~40% to ~22%, while renewable sources (Wind, Solar) grow over time. Natural
    Gas remains relatively stable around 30-32%. The title "area-stacked-percent ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A horizontal legend sits above the
    plot area. The Y-axis shows "Market Share (%)" with percentage suffixes (0%-100%),
    and the X-axis shows "Year" (2015-2024). The layout uses a clean white background
    with subtle gridlines.'
