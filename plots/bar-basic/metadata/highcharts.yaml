review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with subtitle narrative, Top Seller callout annotation,
    and average reference line — three layers of insight
  - 'Strong visual polish: rounded bar corners, subtle shadows, dotted grid lines,
    color hierarchy for top performer'
  - All text sizes explicitly configured for 4800x2700 canvas — nothing relies on
    defaults
  - Clean idiomatic usage of highcharts-core Python API including Annotation and plotLine
    features
  - Sorted descending data with realistic retail scenario makes the chart immediately
    interpretable
  weaknesses:
  - Average line label is positioned at the far right edge and appears slightly cramped
    against the margin
  - The 4,800 data label and Top Seller annotation on Electronics are very close together
    vertically, creating slight visual crowding
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical column chart with 6 product categories
    on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys) sorted
    in descending order by sales. The y-axis shows "Sales (Units)" ranging from 0
    to 5,000. All bars are rendered in Python Blue (#306998) except the Electronics
    bar which uses a darker shade (#1a4971) to highlight the top performer. Data labels
    appear above each bar showing exact values (4,800, 3,100, 2,200, 1,700, 950, 480).
    A red dashed horizontal line indicates the average at ~2,205 units with an italic
    label on the right. A callout annotation with a star emoji reads "Top Seller"
    pointing to the Electronics bar. The title "bar-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is bold at the top, with a subtitle "Electronics dominates with 4,800 units —
    10× more than Toys" providing narrative context. Bars have rounded corners and
    subtle shadow effects. The grid uses dotted lines for a clean look. White background
    with generous margins.
