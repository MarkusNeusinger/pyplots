review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper candlestick representation
  - Professional title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good data generation showing realistic OHLC price movements with both bullish
    and bearish days
  - Proper handling of doji candles (minimum body height)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use any seaborn plotting functions - only styling (sns.set_theme, sns.set_context);
    all actual plotting uses matplotlib directly
  - Legend overlaps data area slightly in the upper left corner
  - Green/red color scheme is finance-standard but not colorblind-accessible
