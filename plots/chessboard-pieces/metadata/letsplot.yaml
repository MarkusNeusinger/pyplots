review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot grammar of graphics for creating the chess board
  - Clean, educational example with the famous Scholar's Mate position
  - Proper chess board orientation and coloring conventions
  - Unicode chess symbols render clearly and are easily recognizable
  - Well-structured code that is easy to understand and modify
  - Correct handling of lets-plot file output location quirk
  weaknesses:
  - Could explore lets-plot hover tooltips for piece names in interactive HTML output
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 chess board showing the Scholar's Mate
    position. The board uses traditional chess colors with tan (#F0D9B5) light squares
    and brown (#B58863) dark squares, with subtle brown border lines between squares.
    Chess pieces are rendered using Unicode symbols - white pieces appear as outlined
    symbols (♔♕♖♗♘♙) and black pieces as filled symbols (♚♛♜♝♞♟). The board is properly
    oriented with white at the bottom (ranks 1-2) and black at the top (ranks 7-8),
    with h1 being a light square per chess standards. File labels (a-h) appear below
    the board and rank labels (1-8) appear on the left side, both in bold text. The
    title "Scholar's Mate · chessboard-pieces · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top in bold. The position shows the famous 4-move checkmate with the white
    queen on f7 delivering checkmate to the black king on e8.
