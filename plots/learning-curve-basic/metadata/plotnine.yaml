review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_ribbon for confidence
    bands
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Color scheme is visually appealing and colorblind-safe (blue/gold contrast)
  - Legend positioning works well within the plot area
  - Realistic ML learning curve behavior accurately depicted
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines which would help read exact values from the plot
  - Y-axis label could include units or range indicator
  image_description: 'The plot shows a learning curve with two lines and confidence
    bands. The training score (blue, #306998) starts at ~0.88 and quickly rises to
    ~0.99, remaining stable. The validation score (yellow/gold, #FFD43B) starts at
    ~0.70 and gradually improves to ~0.89. Both lines have shaded confidence bands
    showing variability. The x-axis shows "Training Set Size" from approximately 50
    to 800, and the y-axis shows "Accuracy Score" ranging from 0.6 to 1.0. The title
    follows the correct format: "learning-curve-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The
    legend is positioned in the lower right area of the plot, clearly distinguishing
    "Training Score" and "Validation Score". The overall layout uses a clean minimal
    theme with good proportions.'
