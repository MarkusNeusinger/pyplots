review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual execution with step-function curves, CI bands, and censoring
    marks all clearly visible and properly layered
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue vs yellow) with good contrast
  - Correct implementation of Kaplan-Meier algorithm including Greenwood formula for
    variance estimation
  - Proper use of Altair layered chart composition and mark types (line, area, tick)
  - Clinically realistic data scenario with appropriate sample sizes and event rates
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a kaplan_meier() function definition which violates the KISS structure
    requirement (imports → data → plot → save, no functions)
  - Y-axis scale extends to 1.10 creating unnecessary whitespace above the survival
    probability ceiling of 1.0
  - Legend placed inside plot area (upper-right) could overlap data in some scenarios;
    consider placing outside
  image_description: The plot displays a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis comparing
    two treatment groups over a 36-month follow-up period. Treatment A is shown in
    blue (#306998) and Treatment B in yellow/gold (#FFD43B). Both survival curves
    follow a step-function pattern starting at 1.0 survival probability and declining
    over time. Treatment A (blue) shows better survival with approximately 40% survival
    at 36 months, while Treatment B (yellow) drops to approximately 20% survival.
    Shaded bands represent 95% confidence intervals around each curve, with appropriate
    transparency. Small tick marks perpendicular to the curves indicate censored observations.
    The title "survival-kaplan-meier · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The
    y-axis shows "Survival Probability" (0.00-1.10) and x-axis shows "Time (Months)"
    (0-40). A legend in the upper right identifies the two treatment groups. Grid
    lines are subtle with dashed styling.

        comment: Good use of Altair's layered chart composition with + operator, step-after
          interpolation, area marks for CI bands, and tick marks for censoring. However,
          could leverage Altair's tooltip interactivity or selection features more.
  verdict: APPROVED
