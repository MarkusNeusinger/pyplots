review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent FiveThirtyEight-inspired visual design with custom background, removed
    spines, and horizontal-only grid
  - 'Strong data storytelling: three named annotations guide the viewer to key outliers
    with curved arrow connections and path effects'
  - Four-dimensional data encoding (x, y, size, color) with both a size legend and
    sector color legend — all clearly labeled
  - Realistic tech company dataset with plausible values across revenue, growth, and
    market cap
  - 'Smart use of matplotlib-specific features: dual legends via add_artist, patheffects
    for text readability, axhline for growth baseline reference'
  - Clean code structure with concise outlier construction using numpy array concatenation
  weaknesses:
  - Minor bubble overlap in the upper-left cluster (low-revenue, high-growth area)
    reduces individual readability slightly
  - The Market Leader annotation arrow points into a dense cluster on the right side
    where several bubbles overlap, making it less clear which specific bubble is being
    highlighted
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bubble chart of tech company metrics on
    a light gray (#FAFAFA) background with a FiveThirtyEight-inspired aesthetic. The
    X-axis shows "Annual Revenue ($B)" ranging from 0 to 140, and the Y-axis shows
    "Revenue Growth Rate (%)" from approximately -15% to 60%. Four sectors are color-coded:
    Cloud/SaaS (steel blue), E-Commerce (orange), Semiconductors (teal/green), and
    Social Media (purple). Bubble sizes represent market capitalization, with a size
    legend in the lower left corner showing reference sizes for $25B, $100B, and $300B.
    Three annotations with arrows highlight notable outliers: "High-Growth Unicorn"
    in the upper-left cluster, "Breakout Performer" in the center, and "Market Leader"
    on the right side. All spines are removed, only horizontal grid lines are displayed
    at low opacity, and a thin reference line sits at 0% growth. A subtle "pyplots.ai"
    watermark appears in the lower-right corner. The sector color legend is positioned
    in the upper right. Approximately 41 bubbles are plotted with white edge highlighting
    and alpha transparency of 0.65.'
