review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex ternary diagram from scratch using matplotlib
    primitives
  - Proper use of scipy gaussian_kde with Silverman bandwidth selection
  - Clear visual separation of three density clusters representing different sediment
    types
  - Perceptually uniform viridis colormap as specified
  - Clean contour lines help interpret density levels
  - Grid lines appropriately subtle beneath density layer
  - Correct title format with spec-id and library
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function ternary_to_cartesian() slightly deviates from strict KISS principle,
    though it improves readability
  - Grid percentage labels along triangle edges could better indicate which component
    they measure
  - Figure uses square aspect ratio (12x12) which is acceptable but does not match
    the 16:9 or 1:1 sizing guidance exactly
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density visualization for sediment
    composition analysis showing Sand, Silt, and Clay percentages. The triangular
    diagram has three clearly labeled vertices: "Sand (%)" at the bottom-left, "Silt
    (%)" at the bottom-right, and "Clay (%)" at the top. The density is visualized
    using a viridis colormap (purple to yellow gradient) with values ranging from
    0.0 to approximately 5.4. Three distinct density clusters are visible: a high-density
    yellow region near the Sand vertex (bottom-left), another high-density yellow
    region near the Clay vertex (top), and a moderate-density region near the Silt
    vertex (bottom-right). White contour lines clearly delineate the density levels.
    Dashed gray grid lines at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% intervals are visible beneath
    the density layer. Percentage tick labels appear along each edge of the triangle.
    A colorbar on the right shows the "Density" scale. The title includes both a descriptive
    name "Sediment Composition Analysis" and the required format "ternary-density
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
