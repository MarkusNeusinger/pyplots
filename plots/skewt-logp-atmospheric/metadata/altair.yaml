review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements the skew transformation for temperature isotherms mathematically
  - Proper logarithmic, inverted pressure scale
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with appropriate temperature/dewpoint profiles
  - Temperature and dewpoint profiles are visually distinct and prominent
  - All required reference line types are implemented (isotherms, dry adiabats, moist
    adiabats, mixing ratios)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output - the invisible rule approach for
    creating a combined legend does not work
  - X-axis domain extends far beyond the actual data range, creating excessive empty
    space on the right side
  - Y-axis label lacks units (should be Pressure (hPa) not pressure)
  - Reference line colors could have better contrast for distinguishing moist adiabats
    from mixing ratio lines
  image_description: The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a logarithmic
    pressure axis (inverted, showing 1000 hPa at bottom to 100 hPa at top). The temperature
    profile is shown as a solid red (crimson) line with circle markers, while the
    dewpoint profile is displayed as a dashed blue line with circle markers. The background
    includes gray dashed isotherms (temperature lines skewed diagonally), green solid
    dry adiabats, light purple/dashed moist adiabats, and blue dashed mixing ratio
    lines. The title "skewt-logp-atmospheric · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed at
    the top. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C, skewed)" and the y-axis shows "pressure".
    However, the legend panel that should appear on the right side is not visible
    in the rendered output - only the plot area is shown without the intended legend
    explaining the 6 line types.
