review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib stackplot with wiggle baseline to create authentic
    streamgraph appearance
  - Well-chosen color palette starting with Python blue/yellow, all colors visually
    harmonious and colorblind-safe
  - Realistic music streaming scenario with thoughtful trends (growing Hip-Hop, seasonal
    Electronic peaks in summer)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with appropriate font sizes for
    4800x2700 output
  - Smart removal of y-axis ticks emphasizing relative proportions rather than absolute
    values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the top stream area - could be positioned outside
    the plot or in a less intrusive location
  - X-axis label Month is minimal - could include the date range for context
  - Streams could show more dramatic variation to better demonstrate the visual power
    of streamgraphs
