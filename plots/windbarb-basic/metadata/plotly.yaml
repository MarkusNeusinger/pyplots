review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wind barb meteorological notation with proper half/full
    barbs and pennants
  - Informative Wind Barb Key annotation explaining the symbology to users
  - Clean, professional appearance with good color choice and grid styling
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing U, V components and wind speed
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Wind Barb Key annotation in bottom right may overlap with some barbs at edge positions
  - Pennant triangles could be more visually distinct (filled triangles would be clearer)
  image_description: The plot displays a 10x6 grid (60 points) of wind barbs representing
    meteorological wind observations from simulated weather stations. Wind barbs are
    rendered in blue (#306998) on a clean white background with subtle gray grid lines.
    The title "windbarb-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The X-axis
    is labeled "Longitude (°E)" ranging from -2 to 11, and the Y-axis is labeled "Latitude
    (°N)" ranging from 0 to 6. Three calm wind indicators (open circles) are visible
    at coordinates around (0,0), (5,4), and (5,2). Various barb configurations show
    half barbs (5 kt) and full barbs (10 kt), with some stronger winds showing pennants
    (50 kt). A legend box labeled "Weather Stations" appears in the upper left corner,
    and an informative Wind Barb Key annotation in the bottom right explains the barb
    notation (calm, half barb, full barb, pennant). Station markers are visible as
    filled blue circles at each grid point.

        comment: Uses hover tooltips with customdata showing wind components and speed;
          generates HTML output for interactivity. Custom barb drawing via manual
          line segments rather than using plotly native vector/quiver capabilities.
