review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging color scheme with scale_fill_gradient2 centered at
    midpoint=0
  - Clean, readable annotations on each cell with proper formatting
  - Realistic financial portfolio data that demonstrates practical correlation analysis
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics (geom_tile + geom_text layering)
  - Appropriate square aspect ratio using coord_fixed for correlation matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Figure size is 12x12 inches instead of recommended 16x9 or proper 3600x3600 resolution
  - Axis labels are generic Variable - could be more descriptive given financial context
  - Does not implement triangle masking as suggested in spec (optional but would reduce
    redundancy)
