review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range selector buttons using geom_label with active/inactive
    visual distinction
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility and trend patterns
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of lets-plot specific features like scale_y_continuous(format="$") and
    ggtb() toolbar
  - Proper handling of lets-plot output file relocation
  weaknesses:
  - Buttons are positioned within data space rather than as proper UI elements; a
    dedicated button bar would be cleaner
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (alpha values visible but not configurable via
    legend)
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing stock price
    data over a 1-year period (January 2025 to January 2026). The line is rendered
    in a blue color (#306998) with a subtle light blue area fill beneath it. The price
    ranges from approximately $105 to $150, showing realistic stock-like volatility
    with a peak around March 2025 (~$150) and a trough in July 2025 (~$107). Six range
    selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, All) are displayed at the top of the chart.
    The "1Y" button is visually highlighted with a filled blue background and white
    text, while the other buttons have a light gray background with blue text. The
    x-axis shows dates formatted as "Mon YYYY" and is angled at 45 degrees. The y-axis
    shows price with dollar formatting ($105-$155). The title "line-range-buttons
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top.

          for interactive toolbar; could have leveraged more lets-plot specific interactivity
