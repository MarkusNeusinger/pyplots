review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizes and colorblind-safe viridis palette
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (temperature across geographic grid) that demonstrates
    the color-mapping concept effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Colorbar is well-positioned with clear label including units
  - Good use of alpha=0.8 for transparency to handle overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Size encoding duplicates the color encoding (both map to temperature) without
    adding informational value
  - Grid legend comment says disabled legend but size variation without legend may
    confuse viewers
  - Could leverage seaborn native hue legend capabilities instead of manually creating
    ScalarMappable
