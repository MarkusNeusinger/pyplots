review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors providing strong contrast
  - Proper implementation of grouped violins with custom positioning using x offsets
  - Clean swarm-like scatter implementation with alternating jitter pattern
  - Interactive HTML export with informative hover templates
  - Good data scenario showing meaningful differences between groups
  weaknesses:
  - Some swarm points extend beyond violin boundaries, particularly visible in the
    Complex-Novice group
  - Meanline is enabled but not highly visible due to low opacity
  image_description: The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm point overlay
    showing response times across three task complexity levels (Simple, Moderate,
    Complex) and two expertise levels (Novice and Expert). The violins are semi-transparent
    with Novice shown in blue (#306998) and Expert in yellow (#FFD43B). Each violin
    is accompanied by scattered data points that match the violin color. The x-axis
    shows "Task Complexity" with three categories, and the y-axis displays "Response
    Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to approximately 1400. A legend titled "Expertise Level"
    is positioned in the upper right corner with a semi-transparent white background.
    The title "violin-grouped-swarm · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The plot effectively demonstrates that response times increase with task complexity,
    and novice users consistently have higher response times than experts. The swarm
    points are visible and show the underlying data distribution within each violin,
    with points jittered horizontally to avoid overlap. The violins show the kernel
    density estimation of the data distribution, with visible mean lines. The plot
    uses a clean white background with subtle gridlines.
