review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with excellent color choices using Python Blue
    as primary
  - Proper use of matplotlib pie chart API with explode feature
  - Good text sizing and positioning - all labels and percentages highly readable
  - Realistic market share data that demonstrates the exploded pie concept well
  - White edge separators between slices improve visual clarity
  - Legend properly positioned with title
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate exploding multiple slices (e.g., 2 slices) to better showcase
    the feature flexibility
  - Minor layout imbalance with legend placement causing slight asymmetry
