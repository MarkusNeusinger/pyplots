review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world data scenario showing energy mix by country with meaningful
    variation
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Clean percentage labels positioned within each bar segment
  - Well-balanced layout with good use of canvas space at 4800x2700
  - Proper normalization of values to 100% even though input data already sums to
    100
  - Legend placement at bottom with 3-column layout is clean and non-intrusive
  weaknesses:
  - Nuclear segment shows limited variation (1-8% across all countries) - more diversity
    would better demonstrate the chart type
  - Font sizes in the library rules suggest smaller values (title_font_size=28) but
    implementation uses much larger (60) - while readable, it deviates from guidelines
