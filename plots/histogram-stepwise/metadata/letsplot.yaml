review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram concept using manual bin calculation
    and geom_line
  - Two overlaid distributions clearly demonstrate the key use case of comparing distributions
    without visual overlap
  - Strong color contrast between blue and yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of ggplot grammar with clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic temperature comparison scenario that makes immediate sense
  - Text sizing and layout are publication-quality
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for the HTML output
  - Legend title is slightly generic compared to a more descriptive label
