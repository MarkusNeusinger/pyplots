review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper stacking via position=stack
  - Comprehensive theme customization with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic and engaging data scenario (plant growth across soil types)
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - White bar borders enhance visual separation between stacked segments
  weaknesses:
  - Could use scale_fill_brewer for more colorblind-safe colors instead of manual
    hex values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked histogram showing plant height distributions
    across three soil types. The x-axis shows "Plant Height (cm)" ranging from 10
    to 50, and the y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to about 68. Three distinct colors
    represent the soil types: dark blue (#306998) for Clay Soil, yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Loamy Soil, and teal (#4ECDC4) for Sandy Soil. The bars are stacked on top
    of each other, with white borders separating segments (alpha=0.85). The distributions
    show different peaks: Sandy Soil peaks around 25cm, Loamy Soil around 30cm, and
    Clay Soil around 22cm. The legend is positioned on the right side. The title "histogram-stacked
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. The plot uses a
    minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines on a white background.'
