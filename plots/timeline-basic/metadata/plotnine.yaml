review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents text overlap entirely
  - Colorblind-safe palette with four distinct, accessible colors for phases
  - Clean implementation of timeline using ggplot grammar of graphics
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic software development project scenario with meaningful milestones
  weaknesses:
  - Event spacing is very uniform (roughly monthly) - more varied spacing would better
    demonstrate timeline capabilities
  - Axis label Date could be more descriptive (e.g., Project Timeline 2024)
