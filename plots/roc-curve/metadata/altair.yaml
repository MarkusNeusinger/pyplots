review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme with blue/yellow/gray that is accessible and visually appealing
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types (:Q, :N)
  - AUC values prominently displayed in legend for easy comparison
  - Diagonal reference line clearly distinguished with dashed style
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for ROC curves
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs saved
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned using absolute pixel coordinates which could be fragile
  - Y-axis has excessive tick density making it appear cluttered
  - No interactivity or tooltips added despite Altair's strength in this area
  - Grid lines could be styled more subtly with smaller dash pattern
