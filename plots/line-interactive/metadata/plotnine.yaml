review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of interactive concepts (tooltip, zoom region, controls)
    adapted for static plotnine output
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with appropriate temporal patterns and anomaly
    spikes
  - Clean grammar-of-graphics structure with properly layered geoms and annotations
  - 'Good use of plotnine-specific features: scale_x_datetime, element_text styling,
    geom_rect for highlighting'
  - Clear visual hierarchy with main data, anomaly markers, and reference lines distinguished
    by color and shape
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is defined in code but not visible in the rendered output - may need legend_position
    adjustment or the legend is being cut off
  - The instructional text at bottom could be more prominent or better positioned
