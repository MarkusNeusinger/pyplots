review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear stepped area chart representation of
    the PR curve
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette using blue and yellow
  - AP score prominently displayed in both subtitle and legend
  - Baseline reference line correctly positioned at positive class ratio
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features (AreaSeries with step, custom margins)
  - Clean HTML export with embedded Highcharts JS for reliable rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions instead of following KISS principle (inline code
    preferred)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity)
  image_description: The plot displays a Precision-Recall curve with a blue stepped
    area chart. The title "precision-recall · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in bold, with a subtitle showing "Average Precision (AP) = 0.926". The
    X-axis is labeled "Recall (Sensitivity)" ranging from 0 to 1, and the Y-axis is
    labeled "Precision (Positive Predictive Value)" also ranging from 0 to 1. The
    main PR curve shows a characteristic stepped descent from high precision at low
    recall to lower precision at high recall, with the area underneath filled in light
    blue with transparency. A horizontal dashed yellow line at y=0.30 represents the
    random baseline (positive class ratio). A legend in the top-right corner shows
    "Classifier (AP = 0.926)" and "Random Baseline (ratio = 0.30)". The grid is subtle
    gray, and the overall layout is clean with good use of space.
