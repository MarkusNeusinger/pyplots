review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves using plotnine native
    grammar of graphics
  - 'All spec requirements met: step functions, confidence intervals, censored marks,
    group comparison'
  - Custom KM estimator with proper Greenwood formula for variance estimation
  - Strong colorblind-accessible color contrast between treatment groups (blue vs
    yellow)
  - Professional appearance with appropriate text sizing for 16:9 format
  - Proper handling of censored observations displayed as tick marks on curves
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of flat KISS structure (imports → data → plot
    → save)
  - Legend position overlaps with data region
  image_description: The plot displays a Kaplan-Meier survival curve comparing two
    treatment groups. Treatment A is shown in blue (#306998) and Treatment B in yellow/gold
    (#FFD43B). Both curves start at 100% survival probability at time 0 and decrease
    over time using characteristic step functions. The blue Treatment A curve extends
    to approximately 75 months with final survival around 20%, while the yellow Treatment
    B curve ends around 35 months reaching close to 0% survival. Shaded confidence
    interval bands surround each curve (blue and yellow respectively, with alpha transparency).
    Vertical tick marks indicating censored observations are visible along both curves.
    The title reads "survival-kaplan-meier · plotnine · pyplots.ai". X-axis shows
    "Time (months)" ranging from 0-75, Y-axis shows "Survival Probability" with percentage
    labels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). A legend in the upper right identifies both
    treatment groups.
