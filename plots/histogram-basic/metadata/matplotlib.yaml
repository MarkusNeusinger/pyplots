review:
  strengths:
  - Intensity-graded bar coloring via patch manipulation is an effective and distinctive
    matplotlib technique
  - Mean and median annotations with boxed labels, arrows, and color-coding provide
    clear statistical storytelling
  - High-performer cluster annotation with curved arrow and axvspan highlight adds
    narrative depth
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed and all font sizes explicitly
    set
  - Realistic exam score data with appropriate left skew and secondary cluster
  weaknesses:
  - The axvspan beige highlight (80-100 region) is somewhat heavy-handed and creates
    slight visual imbalance on the right side — reducing its alpha or narrowing its
    scope would improve balance
  - Data storytelling could be strengthened with one additional insight (e.g., annotating
    the percentage of students scoring above 80)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of exam scores (x-axis: ~30–100
    points, y-axis: 0–45 count). 25 blue (#306998) bars with white edges are rendered
    with intensity-graded opacity — taller bars appear more saturated, shorter bars
    more transparent. A red dashed vertical line marks the Mean (73.7) with a boxed
    annotation connected by an arrow. A blue dotted vertical line marks the Median
    (74.1) with a similarly styled boxed annotation. A "High-performer cluster" italic
    annotation with a curved arrow points to the 80–100 region, which is highlighted
    by a subtle yellow axvspan. Top and right spines are removed, subtle y-axis gridlines
    are present, and the title reads "histogram-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    The distribution shows a slight left skew with a visible secondary cluster in
    the 80–100 range.'
