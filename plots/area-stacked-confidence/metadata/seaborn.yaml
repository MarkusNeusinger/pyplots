review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with three distinct stacked areas and matching confidence
    bands
  - Realistic energy consumption scenario with widening uncertainty over time for
    projections
  - Clean code structure with proper cumulative stacking calculations
  - Title and legend properly formatted with CI explanation
  - Good use of alpha transparency for confidence bands (0.25) and main areas (0.8)
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib fill_between rather than seaborn-native functions
    (though seaborn lacks native stacked area support)
  - Grid legend comment says it shows 90% CI but the legend could have a separate
    entry for bands rather than in title
  image_description: The plot displays a stacked area chart showing energy consumption
    by source (Solar, Wind, Hydro) over quarterly periods from 2020 to 2026. Solar
    is shown in deep blue (#306998) at the bottom, Wind in yellow (#FFD43B) in the
    middle, and Hydro in teal (#4A90A4) at the top. Each stacked area is surrounded
    by lighter semi-transparent confidence bands (approximately 25% opacity) that
    widen over time, representing growing uncertainty in future projections. The y-axis
    shows "Energy Consumption (TWh)" ranging from 0 to approximately 450, and the
    x-axis shows "Quarter" with yearly markers. The title follows the correct format
    "area-stacked-confidence · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left explains
    the energy sources and notes that bands show 90% CI. The grid is subtle with dashed
    lines and appropriate transparency.
