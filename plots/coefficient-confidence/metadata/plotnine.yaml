review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal layout with variables ordered by coefficient magnitude for
    easy comparison
  - Clear visual distinction between significant and non-significant coefficients
    using color
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geoms (vline, errorbarh,
    point)
  - Good sizing and typography for high-resolution output
  - Realistic housing price regression context with diverse predictor types
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow color for non-significant coefficients could have slightly higher contrast
    against white background
  - Grid styling could be slightly more subtle (alpha could be lower)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot with confidence
    intervals for 12 housing price regression predictors. Variables are listed on
    the y-axis, ordered by coefficient magnitude from bottom (Crime Index with the
    most negative effect) to top (Living Area with the most positive effect). Horizontal
    error bars show 95% confidence intervals, with blue (#306998) used for statistically
    significant coefficients (those whose CIs do not cross zero) and yellow/gold (#FFD43B)
    for non-significant coefficients. A vertical dashed gray reference line at x=0
    clearly marks the null hypothesis threshold. The x-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate
    (Standardized)" and the y-axis shows "Predictor Variable". The legend on the right
    distinguishes "Significant" vs "Not Significant" categories. The title follows
    the required format: "coefficient-confidence · plotnine · pyplots.ai".'
