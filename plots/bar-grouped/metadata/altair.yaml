review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative xOffset encoding for creating grouped bars
    without manual position calculation
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between product lines
  - Appropriate font sizes ensure readability at target resolution
  - Tooltips enhance the interactive HTML version
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful quarterly revenue data showing clear
    trends
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-right overlaps slightly with the plot area; consider orient
    right outside the plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    by product line. There are 4 quarters (Q1-Q4) on the x-axis, each with 3 side-by-side
    bars representing Software (dark blue #306998), Hardware (yellow #FFD43B), and
    Services (teal #4ECDC4). The y-axis shows "Revenue (thousands USD)" ranging from
    0 to 180. The title "bar-grouped · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.
    A legend labeled "Product Line" is positioned in the top-right corner. The bars
    have subtle rounded corners at the top. Software consistently has the highest
    revenue across all quarters (120→145→132→168), Hardware is mid-range (85→78→92→105),
    and Services is lowest but growing (45→52→68→75). The grid is very subtle with
    low opacity.'

        comment: Uses xOffset for grouping (Altair-specific), cornerRadius for styling,
          tooltips for interactivity, declarative encoding. Could have added selection/interactivity
          features.
  verdict: APPROVED
