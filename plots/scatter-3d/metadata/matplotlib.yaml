review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent scientific context using protein structure data with realistic Angstrom
    units
  - Clear three-cluster visualization demonstrates spatial relationships effectively
  - Good use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - White edge color on markers helps distinguish overlapping points
  - Clean, well-commented code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar placement on left side creates slight visual asymmetry; consider right
    side or adjusting padding
  - Axis label font size at 18pt is slightly below the recommended 20pt for optimal
    legibility
  - Could benefit from subtle grid lines to help viewers judge positions in 3D space
