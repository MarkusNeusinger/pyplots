review:
  strengths:
  - Clear hierarchical tree layout with root at top
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for Bokeh-native data handling
  - Appropriate color-coding by level with distinct, accessible colors
  - Realistic organizational chart data with meaningful labels
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (16pt) and level annotations (20pt) are too small for 4800x2700 resolution;
    should be at least 24pt and 28pt respectively
  - Level 3 node markers (size=34) appear too small compared to parent nodes; consider
    increasing to 45+
  - Level annotations on left side could be larger and more prominent to serve as
    an effective legend
  - Missing hover tooltips which would showcase Bokeh interactive capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart representing
    a software project team with 24 employees across 4 management levels. At the top
    (Level 0) is a dark blue CEO node (#306998). Level 1 shows 3 yellow VP nodes (#FFD43B)
    - VP Engineering, VP Product, and VP Operations. Level 2 contains 6 light blue
    Director/Manager nodes (#4B8BBE) - Frontend Dir., Backend Dir., PM Lead, UX Lead,
    IT Manager, and HR Manager. Level 3 has 14 green team member nodes (#8BC34A) representing
    individual contributors like developers, designers, and support staff. Gray lines
    (#666666) with 60% opacity connect parent-child relationships showing the reporting
    structure. Level annotations appear on the left side in matching colors indicating
    "Level 0: CEO", "Level 1: VPs", "Level 2: Directors", and "Level 3: Team". The
    title "network-hierarchical · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in 32pt
    font. Node labels are positioned above each circular marker using a y_offset of
    35 pixels.'
