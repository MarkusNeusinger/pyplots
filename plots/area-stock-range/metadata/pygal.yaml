review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic stock price data with proper random walk simulation over 500 trading
    days
  - Clean professional color scheme using pygal custom Style
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs are generated
  - Proper date filtering for selected range (1Y view)
  - Good use of semi-transparent fill (opacity=0.4)
  weaknesses:
  - The mini range navigator chart mentioned in spec is not clearly visible in the
    static PNG output
  - X-axis date labels still overlap despite filtering every 30th label
  - Custom date selection mentioned in spec is not implemented (only preset buttons)
  - The combined image with PIL composition adds complexity
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a stock area chart titled "area-stock-range · pygal · pyplots.ai". The main chart shows stock price data from January 2024 through November 2025 with:
    - Y-axis labeled "Price (USD)" ranging from approximately 120 to 235
    - X-axis labeled "Date" with monthly intervals (Jan 2024, Feb 2024, etc.)
    - A light blue filled area under a darker blue price line
    - The price shows realistic random walk behavior: starting around 150, dipping to ~120 in early 2024, then trending upward to peak around ~235 in August 2025, before declining to ~200
    - Legend at bottom showing "Stock Price"
    - Clean white background with subtle horizontal grid lines
    - The title shows the correct format: "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai"

    Note: The code generates a combined image with a mini range navigator chart below the main chart, but the static PNG appears to only show the main chart section. The HTML output includes interactive range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) and a mini chart with range indicator.
