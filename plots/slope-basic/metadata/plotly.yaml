review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color coding system using Python brand colors (blue for increase, yellow
    for decrease)
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Good use of Plotly annotation system for endpoint labels
  - Realistic business scenario with varied data showing both increases and decreases
  - Proper implementation of hover templates for interactive exploration
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend explaining what blue and yellow colors represent (increase vs
    decrease)
  - Some endpoint labels are positioned close together and could benefit from slight
    vertical adjustment to prevent near-overlap
