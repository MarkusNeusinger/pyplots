review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data representation with realistic primate evolutionary distances based
    on mitochondrial DNA
  - Clean horizontal dendrogram layout with good canvas utilization
  - Species labels are color-coded by clade for easy identification
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Scale annotation provides context for interpreting branch lengths
  weaknesses:
  - Legend colors do not match the actual branch colors in the dendrogram (legend
    shows 5 distinct clade colors but branches are green/gray from scipy default color_threshold)
  - Branch coloring should reflect the clade groups shown in the legend for visual
    consistency
  - Could benefit from thicker branch lines for improved visibility at full resolution
