review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic software development project scenario that demonstrates Gantt
    chart use case perfectly
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color coding by category (6 categories with
    distinct colors)
  - Today indicator line adds practical value and follows spec recommendation
  - Tasks sorted by start date for logical reading order
  - Good use of white edge color on bars for visual separation
  - Appropriate bar height and alpha for readability
  - X-axis date formatting with rotated labels prevents overlap
  weaknesses:
  - sns.set_style("whitegrid") is called AFTER plt.subplots(), which means it has
    no effect on the plot styling
  - The implementation uses matplotlib ax.barh() instead of seaborn plotting functions
    - while acceptable, this does not leverage seaborn distinctive features
  - Legend box overlaps the rightmost portion of the plot area; could be moved to
    lower right or outside the axes
  - Axis labels could include year context (Timeline 2025) for additional clarity
