review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution to render 3D surfaces in lets-plot (a 2D library)
    using polygon-based projection with painter's algorithm
  - Proper implementation of 3D-to-2D projection with configurable elevation and azimuth
    angles
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility and clear height
    encoding
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining each step of the transformation
  - Depth sorting (painter's algorithm) correctly handles polygon occlusion for realistic
    3D appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could better reflect the 3D nature (e.g., X and Y before projection,
    or note the projection in the label)
  - The Y-axis original dimension is lost in the final visualization (only X and Z
    are labeled)
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D surface visualization of z = sin(x) *
    cos(y) rendered as a 2D projection using filled polygons with the painter's algorithm.
    The surface shows characteristic wavy peaks and valleys with a smooth viridis
    colormap - yellow/green for positive Z values (peaks around +0.5) and purple/blue
    for negative Z values (valleys around -0.5). The wireframe edges are visible in
    a subtle blue color (#306998). The title "surface-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Axis labels show "X (projected)" on the horizontal axis and
    "Z (height)" on the vertical axis. A colorbar legend labeled "Z Value" is positioned
    on the right side. The surface appears properly rotated with elevation ~25° and
    azimuth ~45°, giving good depth perception of the 3D structure.
