review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent calendar layout with proper week numbering and month positioning
  - Realistic GitHub-style contribution data with clear weekday patterns (reduced
    weekend activity)
  - Clean sequential colormap that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of scale_y_reverse to position Monday at top (GitHub convention)
  - Well-sized tiles with white borders for clear cell separation
  - Good text sizing throughout for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are empty strings rather than descriptive (e.g., "Week of Year" for
    x, "Day of Week" for y)
  - Could use a more distinctive lets-plot feature like tooltips or flavor_high_contrast_dark
  image_description: The plot displays a calendar heatmap for the year 2024 with weekday
    labels (Mon-Sun) on the y-axis and month labels (Jan-Dec) on the x-axis. Each
    day is represented as a rectangular tile with white borders. The color scale uses
    a sequential gradient from light gray (#ebedf0) for zero/low values to blue (#306998)
    for high values, with the legend labeled "Activity" showing a range of 0-30. The
    data clearly demonstrates a GitHub-style contribution pattern with visibly reduced
    activity on weekends (Saturday and Sunday rows are notably lighter). High-activity
    days (darker blue tiles) are scattered throughout the year. The title correctly
    uses the format "heatmap-calendar · letsplot · pyplots.ai".

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_tile, scale_fill_gradient, scale_y_reverse,
          theme customization. Good use of lets-plot but nothing exceptionally distinctive
          beyond standard ggplot patterns.
  verdict: APPROVED
