review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent educational context (study hours vs exam scores) that is immediately
    relatable
  - Perfect title format following the required convention
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.7) and white edgecolors to distinguish overlapping
    points
  - Clean KISS code structure without unnecessary complexity
  - Appropriate marker size for data density
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha=0.3, dashed) aids readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage distinctive matplotlib features (e.g., annotations, colorbar,
    secondary elements)
  - Marker size s=180 slightly exceeds guidelines for this data density
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2D scatter plot with a clear positive correlation
    between study hours (x-axis, ranging from 1 to 12 hours per week) and exam scores
    (y-axis, ranging from approximately 45% to 100%). The data points are rendered
    as medium blue circles (#306998) with white edge outlines, using appropriate transparency
    (alpha=0.7) that reveals overlapping points. The title "scatter-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large text. Axis labels are clear: "Study
    Hours (per week)" on x-axis and "Exam Score (%)" on y-axis. A subtle dashed grid
    with low opacity helps with value estimation. The 16:9 landscape layout is well-balanced
    with good use of the plotting area. There are approximately 120 data points showing
    natural scatter around a linear trend, with some clustering visible at the score
    ceiling (100%).'
