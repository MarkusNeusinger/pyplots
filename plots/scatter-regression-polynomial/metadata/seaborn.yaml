review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polynomial regression with R² and equation annotation
  - Beautiful visual design with Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) color
    scheme
  - Proper use of confidence band with 95% CI
  - Realistic diminishing returns scenario that matches spec applications
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in lower right slightly overlaps the data region where points exist
  - Uses numpy polyfit instead of seaborn regplot(order=2) which would be more library-idiomatic
  - Generic units for axis labels rather than specific units (e.g., dollars, percentage)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 80 blue-gray data points
    (#306998 color) with white edges against a whitegrid background. A bright yellow
    (#FFD43B) quadratic polynomial curve smoothly fits through the data, showing a
    classic diminishing returns pattern that rises from ~5 at x=0 to peak around ~35
    at x≈6, then declining towards ~25 at x=10. A semi-transparent yellow confidence
    band (95% CI) surrounds the curve. The polynomial equation (y = -0.75x² + 9.54x
    + 5.29) and R² = 0.895 are prominently displayed in a white box in the upper left
    corner. The title correctly follows the format 'scatter-regression-polynomial
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai'. Axis labels show 'Investment (units)' and 'Profit (units)'.
    A well-placed legend in the lower right identifies all three elements.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot and set_style, but polynomial fitting is done
          with numpy. Could have used seaborn's regplot with order parameter for a
          more library-idiomatic approach.
  verdict: APPROVED
