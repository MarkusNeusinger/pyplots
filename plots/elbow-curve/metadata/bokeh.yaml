review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and markers for the high-resolution
    output
  - Clear elbow point annotation with both highlighted marker and vertical reference
    line
  - Realistic K-means inertia data that demonstrates the classic elbow pattern effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines exactly
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource as recommended in Bokeh guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned in the far top-right corner, isolated from the plot area
    with significant empty space
  - Does not utilize Bokeh-specific interactive features like HoverTool to show exact
    values on hover
