review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent STFT implementation from scratch using numpy FFT, demonstrating understanding
    of signal processing
  - Proper use of x/x2/y/y2 encoding for precise rectangle positioning without gaps
  - Good use of viridis colormap as recommended in the specification for perceptually
    uniform display
  - Clean dB scale conversion with appropriate epsilon to avoid log(0)
  - Interactive tooltips showing Time, Frequency, and Power values
  - Correctly limits frequency range to 0-1000 Hz for better visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing .interactive() call which would enable zoom/pan for detailed exploration
    of the spectrogram
  - Colorbar font sizes could be slightly larger for better visibility
  image_description: The plot displays a spectrogram showing a linear chirp signal
    sweeping from approximately 100 Hz to 800 Hz over 2 seconds. The title "spectrogram-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at the top. The x-axis shows "Time (s)"
    ranging from 0.00 to ~2.00 seconds, and the y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" ranging
    from 0 to ~1000 Hz. A bright yellow diagonal band represents the frequency sweep,
    clearly visible against a teal/green background with noise. The colorbar on the
    right shows "Power (dB)" ranging from approximately -60 dB (dark) to +30 dB (yellow/bright).
    The viridis colormap is used effectively, making the signal energy clearly distinguishable
    from the noise floor.
