review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform color representation
  - Realistic market research scenario with plausible customer data
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good bin resolution (25x25) that reveals density patterns clearly
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive interactive features (could have used
    tooltips or hover info)
  - Grid/legend styling could be refined - legend appears somewhat distant from main
    plot area
