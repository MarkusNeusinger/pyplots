review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent facet_grid implementation demonstrating lets-plot's ggplot2 grammar
  - Clean, professional visual design with theme_minimal
  - Realistic sales analysis scenario with meaningful variation across facets
  - Proper use of geom_smooth for trend lines within faceted panels
  - Good canvas utilization with ggsize(1600, 900) scaled 3x
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (yellow/red proximity)
  - Data generation uses for-loop which is less elegant than vectorized numpy/pandas
    operations
  image_description: The plot displays a 3x4 faceted grid showing the relationship
    between Unit Price ($) and Units Sold for a sales analysis scenario. The grid
    is faceted by Category (Clothing, Electronics, Home) on rows and Region (East,
    North, South, West) on columns. Each panel contains scatter points with linear
    regression trend lines. Colors are blue (#306998) for Electronics, yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Clothing, and red (#DC2626) for Home. The title "facet-grid · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Strip labels on the right show Category names, and column
    headers at the top show Region names. All panels show an inverse relationship
    between price and units sold, with trend lines clearly visible.
