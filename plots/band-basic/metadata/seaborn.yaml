review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with perfect text legibility and color accessibility
  - Data demonstrates expanding uncertainty over time, showcasing band plot capabilities
    effectively
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Title format and legend labels are accurate and informative
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.3) allowing visibility of overlapping
    elements
  weaknesses:
  - The fill_between function is from matplotlib rather than a seaborn-specific function;
    while seaborn does not have a native band/fill_between equivalent, the implementation
    correctly uses sns.lineplot for the central line
