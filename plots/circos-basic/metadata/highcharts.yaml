review:
  strengths:
  - Creative and effective implementation of Circos-style visualization using Highcharts
    dependency wheel combined with inner pie chart for additional data track
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct, easily distinguishable colors
  - Realistic trade flow scenario with appropriate data showing varied connection
    strengths between regions
  - Well-balanced layout on 3600x3600 canvas with properly positioned legend
  - Clean, reproducible code with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap at N.America segment where multiple ribbons converge
  - Inner pie chart percentage labels are somewhat small and could be more prominent
  - Missing explicit gaps between outer ring segments as mentioned in specification
  image_description: The plot displays a circular Circos-style visualization showing
    global trade flows between 8 regions. The outer ring is a dependency wheel chart
    with ribbons/chords connecting regions - segments include N.America (dark blue),
    S.America (yellow), Europe (purple), Africa (cyan), MidEast (brown), S.Asia (pink),
    E.Asia (green), and Oceania (olive). The inner track shows a donut/pie chart displaying
    GDP share percentages with white text labels (26%, 28%, 22%, etc.). The title
    "circos-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle "Global
    Trade Flows Between Regions (with GDP Inner Track)". A legend on the right side
    shows all 8 regions with their corresponding colors. The visualization effectively
    uses the dependency wheel chart type with an inner pie chart to create a Circos-like
    layout.

        comment: Shows multiple flow strengths (N.America-E.Asia strong, others varied),

        comment: Excellent use of Highcharts dependency wheel module with multiple
          series composition (wheel + pie). Could use more Highcharts-specific features
          like animations or tooltips in static export.
  verdict: APPROVED
