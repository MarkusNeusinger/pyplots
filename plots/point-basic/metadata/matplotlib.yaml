review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal layout following spec recommendation for readable category
    labels
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-sized markers and error bar caps
  - Reference line adds valuable context (overall mean) as suggested in spec
  - Varying confidence interval widths demonstrate real-world uncertainty patterns
  - Clean, professional appearance suitable for publication
  weaknesses:
  - Could add alpha transparency to markers for even better visual distinction (minor)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate chart showing customer
    satisfaction scores (1-10 scale) across 7 departments. Each department has a blue
    circular marker (#306998) with white edge representing the point estimate, and
    horizontal error bars with caps showing 95% confidence intervals. A yellow/gold
    dashed vertical reference line indicates the overall mean (6.8) with a text annotation.
    The title "point-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is clearly displayed at the
    top. The layout is clean with subtle gray grid lines on the x-axis and well-proportioned
    margins.
