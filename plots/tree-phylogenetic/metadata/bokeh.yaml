review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features including HoverTool with informative
    tooltips showing scientific names
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate color scheme (Python blue/yellow)
  - Well-structured clade annotations with italic styling for taxonomic names
  - Scale bar properly indicates evolutionary distance units
  - Comprehensive legend explaining node types
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in far top-right corner could be closer to the tree for better
    visual association
  - Title format includes descriptive prefix instead of strictly following spec-id
    format
  image_description: The plot displays a rectangular phylogenetic tree (cladogram)
    showing primate evolutionary relationships. The tree has a clean white background
    with blue (#306998) branch lines connecting nodes. Five leaf nodes are shown as
    yellow circles with blue outlines (Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutan, Gibbon),
    and four internal/ancestral nodes are shown as smaller solid blue circles. Species
    labels appear to the right of each leaf node in dark gray text. Clade annotations
    ("Hominini", "Homininae", "Hominidae") appear in italics near their respective
    ancestral nodes. A scale bar at the bottom left indicates "0.1 substitutions/site".
    The x-axis is labeled "Evolutionary Distance (substitutions per site)" with tick
    marks from 0 to 1. A legend in the top-right distinguishes "Extant Species (Leaf
    Nodes)" from "Ancestral Nodes (Internal)". The title "Primate Evolution · tree-phylogenetic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left.
