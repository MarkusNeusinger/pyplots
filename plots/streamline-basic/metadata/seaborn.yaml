review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using seaborn lineplot with units parameter to trace streamlines
    since seaborn lacks native streamline support
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and intuitive velocity
    encoding
  - Clean implementation of Euler integration for streamline tracing with proper bounds
    checking
  - Good use of seaborn set_theme and set_context for consistent styling
  - Directional arrows added using FancyArrowPatch to indicate flow direction
  - Square figure appropriately chosen for equal aspect ratio circular flow visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels display X Position and Y Position but units (m) only appear in code,
    not rendered in actual axis labels
  - Inner streamlines show some visual artifacts/overlap in the center region around
    radius 0.5
  - Implementation heavily relies on matplotlib primitives rather than showcasing
    more seaborn-specific features
