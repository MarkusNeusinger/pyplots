review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging colormap (blueorange) with domainMid=50 to center the
    color scale
  - Smart conditional text coloring (white on dark cells, black on light cells) for
    optimal readability
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax combining heatmap + text layers
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity in HTML export
  - Well-proportioned 8x8 matrix with clear diagonal pattern demonstrating heatmap
    utility
  weaknesses:
  - Data could include negative values to fully showcase the diverging colormap potential
  - Generic row/column labels (Row A, Col 1) could be more realistic (e.g., correlation
    matrix with variable names)
  - X-axis labels appear slightly rotated which is unnecessary for short labels
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 heatmap with rows labeled "Row A" through
    "Row H" and columns labeled "Col 1" through "Col 8". The colormap uses a blue-orange
    diverging scheme (blueorange) with blue representing low values (~8-25) and orange/brown
    representing high values (~100-110). Each cell displays its numeric value as text
    annotation - white text on dark cells and black text on light cells. A clear diagonal
    pattern is visible with higher values along the main diagonal descending from
    top-left to bottom-right. The title "heatmap-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. A vertical colorbar legend labeled "Value" shows the scale from approximately
    20 to 100.
