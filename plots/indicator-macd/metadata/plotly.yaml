review:
  strengths:
  - All three MACD components (MACD line, Signal line, histogram) are clearly visualized
    with distinct colors
  - Proper use of green/red histogram coloring for positive/negative values as specified
  - Zero reference line with annotation helps identify crossover points
  - Parameters annotation in the corner documents the standard 12/26/9 settings
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Good font sizing for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Initial data period shows MACD/Signal starting from large negative values due
    to EMA warm-up, which could confuse viewers
  - Legend placement in upper-left may overlap with histogram bars in that region
    during certain zoom levels
  - Could benefit from custom hover templates showing exact values for better interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a MACD technical indicator chart spanning
    approximately August 2025 to December 2025. The chart features three main components:
    (1) a dark blue MACD line showing the difference between 12-day and 26-day EMAs,
    oscillating between approximately -2.5 and +1.3; (2) a yellow/gold Signal line
    (9-day EMA of MACD) that follows the MACD line with a lag; (3) a histogram with
    green bars for positive values and red/pink bars for negative values, showing
    the difference between MACD and Signal lines. A dashed gray horizontal zero reference
    line is present with a "Zero Line" annotation on the left side. The title "indicator-macd
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The X-axis shows "Date" with monthly
    intervals, Y-axis shows "MACD Value". A legend in the upper-left corner identifies
    all three series. Parameters annotation "EMA(12), EMA(26), Signal(9)" appears
    in the lower-right corner. The chart shows clear bullish and bearish periods with
    multiple crossover signals visible.'
