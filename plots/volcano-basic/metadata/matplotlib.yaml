review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including threshold lines, color
    coding, and gene annotations
  - Scientifically accurate data simulation with p-values correlated to fold change
    magnitude
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper axis formatting with subscript notation (Log₂, Log₁₀)
  - Symmetric axis limits for better visual interpretation
  - Good alpha transparency for handling overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Marker sizes could be larger (s=100-200 recommended for 2000 points density)
  - No use of distinctive matplotlib features like PathEffects for label backgrounds
    or custom colormaps
  - Legend placement in upper right could potentially overlap with high-significance
    up-regulated points
  image_description: 'The plot shows a volcano plot displaying differential gene expression
    data. The x-axis shows "Log₂ Fold Change" ranging from approximately -6 to 6,
    and the y-axis shows "-Log₁₀ (p-value)" ranging from 0 to 6. Points are colored
    in three categories: gray for "Not significant" (centered in the middle below
    the threshold lines), blue (#306998, Python Blue) for "Down-regulated" genes (left
    side), and gold/yellow (#FFD43B, Python Yellow) for "Up-regulated" genes (right
    side). Three dashed threshold lines are present: one horizontal line at y≈1.3
    (p-value significance cutoff) and two vertical lines at x=±1 (fold change cutoffs).
    Top significant genes are labeled on both sides (Gene_1971, Gene_262, Gene_668,
    Gene_1591, Gene_1539 on the left; Gene_1957, Gene_1615, Gene_209, Gene_179, Gene_478
    on the right). The title follows the correct format "volcano-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai". Legend is positioned in the upper right. Grid lines are subtle
    with dashed style and low alpha.'
