review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layered syntax (ggplot
    + geoms + theme)
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that perfectly demonstrates line plot trend
    visualization capability
  - Well-sized visual elements (line width 2.5, point size 6) appropriate for the
    data density
  - Proper font sizing following library guidelines (24pt title, 20pt axis, 16pt ticks)
  - Clean, minimal aesthetic with subtle grid that does not distract from the data
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows decimal tick values (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5) instead of integer
    months (1-12); should use scale_x_continuous with breaks=range(1,13) for cleaner
    month representation
