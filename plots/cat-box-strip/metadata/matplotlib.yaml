  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing different distributions, spreads, and outliers across
    groups
  - Clean combination of boxplot and scatter overlay with proper jitter
  - Yellow median line provides excellent contrast against blue boxes
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for data density
  - Correct use of patch_artist for filled boxes
  - Code follows KISS principle perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Response Value (units)" or "Score")
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like custom boxplot statistics or violinplot
    overlay for more library-distinctive implementation
  image_description: The plot displays a box plot with strip overlay showing four
    treatment groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) on the x-axis
    and Response Value (0-100) on the y-axis. Each group has a light blue semi-transparent
    box with a yellow/gold median line. Individual data points are overlaid as blue
    circles with white edges and jitter applied for visibility. Treatment B notably
    shows outliers at both high (~80-82) and low (~15) values. The title uses the
    correct format "cat-box-strip · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle
    dashed lines on the y-axis only. All text is clearly readable with appropriate
    font sizes.
