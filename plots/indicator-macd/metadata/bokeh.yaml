review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three MACD components (MACD line, signal line,
    histogram)
  - Clean separation of positive/negative histogram bars with appropriate colors
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource and Bokeh models (Legend, Span)
  - Well-documented parameter values (12-26, 9) in the legend
  - Appropriately trimmed warmup period (starts from day 35)
  - Large, readable text sizes suitable for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red histogram colors not optimal for colorblind accessibility (consider
    using blue/orange or colorblind-safe palette)
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive data exploration - a key Bokeh strength
  - Axis labels lack units (could use MACD Value (points) or similar context)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) technical indicator chart spanning from July 2025 to November 2025. The chart includes four main components:

    - MACD Line (blue): Shows the difference between 12-day and 26-day EMAs, ranging from approximately -3.5 to +1.5
    - Signal Line (yellow/orange): The 9-day EMA of the MACD line, smoothly tracking the MACD
    - Histogram (green bars): Positive values above the zero line showing bullish momentum
    - Histogram (red bars): Negative values below the zero line showing bearish momentum

    A gray dashed horizontal zero reference line clearly marks the crossover point. The legend is positioned in the top-left corner with clear labels including parameter values (12-26) and (9). Background is light gray (#FAFAFA) with subtle gridlines. The data demonstrates clear MACD/signal crossovers and histogram expansion/contraction patterns typical of real trading scenarios.
