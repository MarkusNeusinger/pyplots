review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing four distinct distribution types (normal, right-skewed
    with outliers, bimodal, uniform)
  - Clean layering of geom_violin and geom_boxplot demonstrating plotnine grammar
    of graphics
  - Good color palette with Python-themed colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Perfect title format and professional appearance
  - Outliers visible in Product B demonstrating complete statistical representation
  weaknesses:
  - Does not showcase plotnine-specific features beyond basic geoms (could use faceting,
    stat_summary, or position adjustments)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Score (points) or Score (0-100))
