review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts built-in jitter feature for proper strip plot behavior
  - 'Thoughtful data design showing different distribution characteristics: tight
    vs wide spread, outliers, bimodal patterns'
  - Colorblind-safe palette following library guidelines
  - Clean rendering with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - White marker borders add visual clarity and separation between overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in top-right corner encroaches on the data visualization area
  - Points lack alpha/transparency which would help visualize density in overlapping
    areas
