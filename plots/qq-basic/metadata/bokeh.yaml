review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 resolution with clear legibility at all levels
  - Proper Q-Q plot implementation with correct theoretical quantile calculation using
    Abramowitz & Stegun approximation
  - Good use of Bokeh Slope model for the reference line
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate color scheme with good contrast and accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify what the dashed yellow line represents
  - Data could show more diverse distribution characteristics (heavy tails, outliers)
    to better demonstrate Q-Q plot interpretation
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactivity (hover tooltips showing exact quantile values)
