review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements a complex Skew-T Log-P diagram using plotnine grammar
    of graphics approach
  - Correct 45° skew transformation for temperature isotherms
  - Logarithmic and inverted pressure axis properly configured
  - Clear color differentiation between all reference line types using distinct colors
    and linetypes
  - Realistic synthetic atmospheric sounding data with proper meteorological physics
  - Thick profile lines make T and Td clearly distinguishable from reference grid
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only reference lines but not the Temperature and Dewpoint profiles
  - Isobars (horizontal pressure lines) defined in code but not visually prominent
    in rendered output
  - Profile data only covers ~1000-300 hPa range, leaving upper diagram empty of profile
    data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a
    white background. The Y-axis shows pressure levels from 100 hPa at the bottom
    to 1000 hPa at the top (logarithmic scale, properly inverted). The X-axis represents
    temperature with a skewed 45° transformation. Four types of reference lines are
    visible: blue solid isotherms (temperature lines at 45°), orange dashed dry adiabats,
    green dotted moist adiabats, and purple dash-dot mixing ratio lines. The temperature
    profile (T) is drawn as a thick red solid line, and the dewpoint profile (Td)
    as a thick blue dashed line, both clearly visible against the reference grid.
    Text annotations "T" and "Td" label the respective profiles. A legend titled "Reference
    Lines" appears on the right side showing all four reference line types. The title
    follows the correct format: "skewt-logp-atmospheric · plotnine · pyplots.ai".'
