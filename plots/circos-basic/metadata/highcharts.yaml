review:
  strengths:
  - Creative and effective implementation of Circos-style visualization using Highcharts
    dependency wheel combined with inner pie chart for additional data track
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct, easily distinguishable colors
  - Realistic trade flow scenario with appropriate data showing varied connection
    strengths between regions
  - Well-balanced layout on 3600x3600 canvas with properly positioned legend
  - Clean, reproducible code with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap at N.America segment where multiple ribbons converge
  - Inner pie chart percentage labels are somewhat small and could be more prominent
  - Missing explicit gaps between outer ring segments as mentioned in specification
