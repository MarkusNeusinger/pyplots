review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart label truncation that prevents overlap while keeping cells identifiable
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each hierarchy level
  - File system example provides intuitive, realistic context that demonstrates the
    chart type well
  - Proper top-to-bottom icicle layout matching the specification
  - Good use of tooltips for full node information
  - Level labels on the right side provide helpful context
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom has spacing issue causing Subcategory and Item labels to appear
    merged together
  - Heavy reliance on manual SVG construction (xml.etree.ElementTree) rather than
    pygal chart classes, since pygal lacks native icicle support
  - Some very narrow cells (like Icon_1, Icon_2) are barely visible
