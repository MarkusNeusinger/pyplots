review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis colormap implementation that is colorblind-safe
  - Custom colorbar with gradient rendering demonstrates advanced Highcharts usage
  - Clean tooltip showing all three data dimensions (X, Y, Temperature)
  - Appropriate marker sizing with subtle outlines for point visibility
  - Good use of Highcharts renderer API for the colorbar
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a helper function (interpolate_color) instead of pure sequential
    KISS structure
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., X Position (km) for the geographic scenario)
