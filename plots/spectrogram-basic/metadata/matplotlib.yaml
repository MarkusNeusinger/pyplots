review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spectrogram visualization with clear chirp signal and tone burst demonstration
  - Perfect use of viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe
  - Proper dB scale on colorbar with appropriate floor value (-80 dB)
  - Good NFFT (256) and overlap (200) parameters for reasonable time-frequency resolution
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle
  - Signal combination (chirp + burst + noise) effectively demonstrates time-varying
    frequency content
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more matplotlib-specific features such as adding a time-domain
    plot of the signal above the spectrogram
  - The burst signal at 500 Hz overlaps visually with the chirp in a way that could
    be clearer with different timing
