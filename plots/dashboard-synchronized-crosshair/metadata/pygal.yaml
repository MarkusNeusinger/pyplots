quality_score: 55
review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic stock trading scenario with price, volume, and RSI indicators
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Title format is correct
  - HTML implementation includes JavaScript for synchronized crosshair
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: PNG shows single overlaid chart instead of three stacked panels with
    independent Y-axes as required by spec'
  - Normalization defeats the purpose of showing metrics at their natural scales (price
    in $, volume in millions, RSI 0-100)
  - The specification explicitly requires stacked vertical layout with independent
    y-axis scales - neither is present in the PNG
  - No synchronized crosshair annotation visible in the static PNG
  image_description: 'The PNG shows a single combined line chart with three overlaid
    series: Price (blue), Volume (yellow), and RSI (red) - all plotted on the same
    Y-axis with a "Normalized Value" scale from 0-100. The X-axis shows "Trading Day"
    from Day 1 to Day 200 with rotated labels. There is a legend at the bottom identifying
    the three series. The title reads "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai". Notably, the image does NOT show the three separate stacked panels
    as described in the specification - instead all series share a single plot area
    which defeats the purpose of independent Y-axis scales for each metric.'
