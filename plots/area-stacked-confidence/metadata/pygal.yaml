review:
  strengths:
  - Good KISS code structure with clear data generation
  - Appropriate business context with realistic revenue forecasting scenario
  - Uses pygal custom Style class effectively for font sizes and colors
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, readable code with helpful comments
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence bands are implemented incorrectly - they are stacked as separate series
    rather than visually surrounding each product series
  - The stacking approach means confidence bands add to the total stack height rather
    than showing range around each series
  - Legend is cluttered with 9 series entries and confusing CI labels
  - Semi-transparency for bands is not visible or effective in the current implementation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart with white background
    showing quarterly revenue forecasts (Q1''24 to Q4''25) for three product lines.
    The chart has three main stacked areas: Product A (Core) in dark blue at the bottom,
    Product B (Growth) in yellow in the middle, and Product C (New) in red/coral at
    the top. Each product has associated "confidence interval" series shown as separate
    thin stacked bands above and below the main series. The y-axis shows Revenue ($M)
    from 0-400+, and the x-axis shows Quarter. Data points are marked with small dots.
    A legend at the bottom displays all 9 series in three columns. The title correctly
    shows "area-stacked-confidence · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
