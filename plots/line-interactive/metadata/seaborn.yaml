review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with proper text sizing and colorblind-safe colors
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed
  - Realistic temperature data with believable seasonal patterns
  - Proper title format and well-labeled axes with units
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Seaborn is a static plotting library and CANNOT provide the interactive
    features required by this spec (hover tooltips, zoom/pan, range selection, reset
    button)'
  - The annotation and shaded region are static workarounds that do not satisfy the
    specification requirements
  - This spec explicitly requires interactivity which is only possible with plotly,
    bokeh, altair, highcharts, or letsplot
