review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of learning curve with appropriate training vs validation
    gap
  - Confidence bands shown as dashed lines effectively communicate uncertainty
  - Custom style properly scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue and gold)
  - Proper KISS code structure with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears slightly clipped/truncated, reducing readability
  - Lower portion of the plot (y < 0.7) is mostly empty white space
  - Does not fully leverage pygal interactive SVG features (tooltips, hover effects)
