review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a custom heatmap chart type by extending pygal Graph
    class
  - Uses viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended
    in the spec
  - Proper dB scale conversion for power representation
  - Smooth color interpolation between colormap stops
  - 'Includes all required outputs: PNG, SVG, and HTML'
  - Clean handling of scipy import path collision issue
  - Good signal generation with chirp plus harmonics showing time-frequency characteristics
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a class structure rather than KISS flat script (though necessary for
    extending pygal)
  - Grid opacity at 0.25 with white color may be slightly too visible on the colorful
    background
