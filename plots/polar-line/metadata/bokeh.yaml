review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent simulation of polar coordinates in Bokeh (which lacks native polar support)
    using manual Cartesian conversion
  - Clean, readable hour labels around the perimeter with good spacing
  - Appropriate data scenario (wind speed pattern) that naturally fits polar/cyclical
    visualization
  - Good color contrast between the two series (blue/yellow)
  - Properly closed loops connecting back to starting point
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis label for radial dimension (could add Wind Speed m/s text annotation)
  - Radius labels (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) positioned only on positive X-axis could be more
    prominent
  image_description: 'The plot shows a polar line chart visualizing wind speed patterns
    over 24 hours for two days. The chart uses a circular layout with hour labels
    (0h-22h) positioned around the perimeter at 2-hour intervals. Concentric circles
    represent wind speed values (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 m/s). Two line series are displayed:
    Day 1 in blue (#306998) and Day 2 in yellow (#FFD43B), both with data markers.
    The lines form closed loops connecting back to the starting point. The plot has
    a light gray background (#fafafa) with subtle gray grid lines. A legend in the
    top-right corner identifies the two series. The title "polar-line · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and export_png, but doesn't leverage Bokeh-specific
          interactive features like HoverTool. However, for a PNG export this is acceptable.
  verdict: APPROVED
