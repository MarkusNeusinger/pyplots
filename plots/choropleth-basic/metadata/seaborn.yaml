review:
  strengths:
  - Creative tile grid approach that works within seaborn heatmap capabilities
  - 'Excellent use of seaborn heatmap features: mask for empty cells, dual annotations
    (state codes + values), colorbar customization'
  - Colorblind-safe YlGnBu palette with appropriate sequential coloring
  - Clean readable layout with proper title formatting
  - Good data with realistic GDP growth values showing appropriate variation
  weaknesses:
  - Not a true choropleth map - uses a tile grid heatmap instead of actual geographic
    shapes with boundaries
  - Missing map projection as specified (Robinson for world, Albers for US)
  - Specification asks for region boundaries to be clearly visible but not overwhelming
    - current white grid lines at width=3 are quite prominent
  - No handling of missing data scenario (showing gray or hatched pattern) as mentioned
    in spec Notes
  - Value annotation font size (13pt) is smaller than ideal for the 4800x2700 resolution
