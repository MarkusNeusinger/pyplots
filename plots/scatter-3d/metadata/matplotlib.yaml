review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for color-encoding z-values, adding effective
    4th dimension visualization
  - Well-structured clustered data that clearly demonstrates 3D spatial relationships
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=120) and transparency (alpha=0.7) for the data density
  - Professional styling with white edge markers and semi-transparent panes
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic ("X Dimension") without units or domain context - consider
    using a specific scenario like molecular coordinates or feature space dimensions
  - Colorbar placement creates slight layout imbalance with extra whitespace on the
    right side
