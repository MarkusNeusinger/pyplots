  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including reference line, ±2σ
    bands, outlier highlighting, and trend line
  - Deliberately generated data with quadratic component to demonstrate non-linear
    residual pattern detection
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with clear data generation
    logic
  - Good visual design with colorblind-safe colors (blue/yellow) and appropriate transparency
    levels
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all visual elements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context (e.g., "Fitted Values (ŷ)" or
    similar notation)
  - Could demonstrate heteroscedasticity more clearly with variance that changes across
    fitted values
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot with fitted values (ranging
    from approximately -5 to 50) on the x-axis and residuals (observed minus predicted,
    ranging from about -10 to 10) on the y-axis. The title reads "residual-plot ·
    matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in large font at the top. Regular residual points are
    shown as blue circles (#306998) with white edges, while outliers exceeding 2 standard
    deviations are highlighted in yellow (#FFD43B) with blue edges. A solid black
    horizontal reference line at y=0 represents perfect predictions. Dashed gray horizontal
    lines mark the ±2σ boundaries, with a light blue shaded band between them. A red
    polynomial trend line curves through the data, showing a clear U-shaped pattern
    indicating the non-linearity that the linear model fails to capture. The legend
    is positioned in the upper left corner with clear labels for all elements.

        comment: Markers sized appropriately (s=150) for 150 data points with good

        comment: Good use of matplotlib's axhline, fill_between, scatter with styling,
          and polyfit for trend line. Could leverage more advanced features like subplot
          with marginal distributions or custom tick formatting
  verdict: APPROVED
