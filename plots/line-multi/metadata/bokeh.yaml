review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing and readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean legend placement on right side avoids overlap with data
  - Good use of varying line styles (solid/dashed) for additional differentiation
  - Markers at data points improve readability for sparse data
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern idiomatic to Bokeh
  - Month labels using major_label_overrides for readability
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend glyph rendering appears small/inconsistent in PNG output
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive exploration of data points
  - Cyan and blue colors could be more distinct for accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 multi-line series comparing monthly sales
    data for different product categories over 12 months. Electronics (Python blue
    #306998) shows a strong upward trend from ~48k to ~79k with solid line and circular
    markers. Clothing (gold/yellow #FFD43B) shows a declining trend with seasonal
    variation from ~39k to ~17k using solid line. Furniture (red/orange #E24A33) shows
    relatively stable values around 23-28k with dashed line. Groceries (cyan/teal
    #348ABD) remains mostly flat around 47-55k with dashed line. The title "line-multi
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. X-axis shows month abbreviations
    (Jan-Dec), Y-axis shows "Sales (thousands $)" ranging from 10-80. Legend is positioned
    on the right side outside the plot area with clear series identification. Grid
    lines are subtle with dashed styling.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource appropriately and proper legend construction,
          but doesn't leverage Bokeh's distinctive interactive features like HoverTool,
          tooltips, or other interactive widgets
  verdict: APPROVED
