review:
  strengths:
  - Gradient fill using imshow clipped to a PathPatch is a creative, distinctively
    matplotlib technique that produces a visually appealing result
  - Viral post annotation with arrow adds genuine data storytelling
  - Weekend dips and upward trend in synthetic data showcase realistic area chart
    patterns
  - All font sizes explicitly set per library guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Clean spine removal and subtle gridlines create polished visual refinement
  weaknesses:
  - 'Some vertical headroom above the spike creates wasted canvas space (VQ-05: 2/4)'
  - 'The imshow+PathPatch approach is slightly over-engineered compared to fill_between
    with a gradient (CQ-04: 1/2)'
  - Could benefit from one additional annotation (e.g., labeling weekend pattern or
    overall trend) to reach full storytelling marks
  image_description: The plot shows a basic area chart titled "Website Traffic · area-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The x-axis represents "Day of Month" (1–30), and the
    y-axis represents "Daily Visitors (count)" (0–~8500). The area below the line
    is filled with a vertical gradient transitioning from light blue (#d6e6f5) at
    the bottom to dark Python Blue (#306998) near the data line, at alpha 0.6. The
    solid line on top is dark blue with linewidth 3. The data shows an upward trend
    from ~3000 visitors to ~5000, with visible weekend dips (around days 6–7, 13–14,
    20–21, 27–28). A prominent spike reaches ~8200 on day 18, annotated with "Viral
    post" in bold blue text with an arrow pointing to the peak. Top and right spines
    are removed. Subtle y-axis gridlines at alpha 0.2 aid value estimation. Layout
    is clean with balanced margins.
