review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of cumulative histogram using plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Excellent text sizing with properly configured theme elements for 4800x2700 output
  - Good use of realistic product shelf life data scenario
  - Proper color scheme with blue bars and subtle border contrast
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Manual histogram calculation with numpy instead of exploring plotnine native stat_bin
    with cumulative transformation
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram showing product shelf
    life measurements in days. The visualization uses blue bars (#306998) with darker
    borders (#1a3d5c) arranged in ascending stair-step fashion from left to right.
    The x-axis shows "Shelf Life (days)" ranging from approximately 20 to 75 days,
    while the y-axis displays "Cumulative Count" from 0 to 450. The title "histogram-cumulative
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The bars form a characteristic S-curve
    pattern typical of cumulative distributions, showing slower accumulation at the
    tails and steeper growth in the middle range. The background uses a minimal theme
    with subtle gray grid lines.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_bar and theme_minimal, but manual histogram
          calculation instead of native geom_histogram with cumulative option
  verdict: APPROVED
