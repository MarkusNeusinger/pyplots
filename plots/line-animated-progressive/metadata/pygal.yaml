review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with trend and seasonality
  - Properly uses pygal Style for customization
  - Correct canvas size (4800x2700) and file outputs (PNG and HTML)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not implement small multiples as specified for static output - overlaying
    4 series on one chart makes earlier stages nearly invisible
  - Progressive stages (Q1, H1, Q3) are obscured by Full Year line instead of being
    shown in separate panels
  - Legend labels are confusing - does not clearly indicate these are progressive
    snapshots
  - Blue/light blue color distinction is weak for accessibility
  - Missing gradient or visual markers to indicate direction of progression
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing "Website Visitors" on
    the y-axis (ranging from ~51,000 to ~79,000) against "Month" on the x-axis (Jan
    through Dec). The title correctly reads "line-animated-progressive · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    Four data series are shown: Q1 Progress (blue), H1 Progress (yellow), Q3 Progress
    (light blue), and Full Year (green). All four series are overlaid on a single
    chart using cubic interpolation creating smooth curves. The Full Year green line
    dominates the visualization, extending from January to December with a general
    upward trend and some seasonal variation. The earlier progress stages (Q1, H1,
    Q3) are only visible in segments where the Full Year line has not yet covered
    them - primarily in the middle months. The legend is positioned at the bottom
    with 4 horizontal items. The background is white with subtle y-axis grid lines.'

        comment: Line chart is correct, but the spec calls for small multiples version
