review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types, layer
    composition, and configuration chain
  - Strong data storytelling with trend line, correlation annotation (r = 0.92), and
    informative subtitle
  - Professional aesthetic with custom color hierarchy, white marker strokes, subtle
    dashed grid, and muted axis styling
  - Realistic educational scenario with thoughtful mixture distribution creating natural
    data density variation
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: interactive zoom/pan, tooltips, HTML export
    alongside PNG'
  weaknesses:
  - Layout balance could be improved — some underutilized canvas space in corners
  - X-axis label lacks explicit unit notation (e.g., Study Hours per Day (hrs))
  - Trend line computed manually with np.polyfit instead of using Altair built-in
    transform_regression
  - Separate DataFrames for trend and annotation add verbosity to the code
  - Domain lines still visible — removing them would further refine the minimal aesthetic
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 100 blue filled circular
    markers (#306998) with white edge strokes on a clean white background. The title
    "scatter-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently at the top in dark
    text (~28pt), with a gray subtitle "Positive correlation between daily study hours
    and exam performance" below it. The X-axis is labeled "Study Hours per Day" ranging
    from 1 to 10, and the Y-axis is labeled "Exam Score (%)" ranging from 20 to 100.
    A dashed gray trend line runs diagonally from the lower-left to upper-right, indicating
    the positive linear relationship. A correlation annotation "r = 0.92" is positioned
    near the center of the plot in gray bold text. The grid consists of subtle dashed
    lines at low opacity. The data points show a clear positive correlation with natural
    scatter — denser in the middle hours range (4-7) and sparser at the extremes,
    creating a realistic distribution. The overall layout is clean and professional
    with good use of whitespace and a cohesive muted color scheme.
