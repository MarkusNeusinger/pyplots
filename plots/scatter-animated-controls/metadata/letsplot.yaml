review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style visualization with realistic country
    data
  - Correct fallback approach using faceted view for library without native animation
    support
  - Well-formatted title following exact spec requirements
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics features (scales, faceting, theming)
  - Proper sizing with ggsize(1600, 900) and scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests large year indicator per panel for Gapminder storytelling feel -
    facet strip labels work but larger text could enhance the visualization
  - Some point overlap in the 2019 panel where multiple countries converge at higher
    GDP/life expectancy values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a faceted scatter visualization with 5 panels
    showing key years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2019). Each panel shows GDP per Capita
    on a logarithmic x-axis (ranging from ~3,162 to ~31,623 USD) vs Life Expectancy
    on the y-axis (56-80 years). Ten fictional countries are represented by different
    colored circles using the "Paired" color palette: Northland (light blue), Eastoria
    (dark blue), Westopia (light green), Southaven (dark green), Centralia (pink),
    Alpinia (red), Deltania (light orange), Oceanica (dark orange), Valleysia (light
    purple), and Highlands (dark purple). Point sizes encode population (ranging from
    ~50M to ~150M as shown in legend). The title "scatter-animated-controls · lets-plot
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently at the top. A legend on the right shows
    both population size scale and country color mapping. The plot uses a minimal
    theme with subtle gray gridlines.'
