review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts plotLines feature for the reference line with label
  - Effective combination of LineSeries for the curve and ScatterSeries for key percentile
    annotations
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (Python blue/yellow)
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle with baseline rate
  - Good data labels on key percentiles showing lift multipliers
  weaknesses:
  - The Random Selection (Lift = 1) label appears to be cut off at the right edge
    of the plot
  - Lift values at 10%, 20%, and 30% are identical (1.52x), which looks artificial;
    the data generation could show more variation
  - Code complexity with regex extraction of JS literal could be simplified
