review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper segment sizing proportional to total trade
    volume
  - Well-implemented bezier ribbons connecting regions with appropriate transparency
  - Good use of inner track to display additional GDP growth data
  - Realistic trade flow scenario with sensible numeric values
  - Clean legend placement and region labeling with proper text rotation
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Inner track annotation positioned at bottom-left is quite small and easy to miss
  - Title font at 48pt appears relatively small for the 3600x3600 canvas size
  - Some ribbon colors could use slightly more differentiation when many overlap in
    the center
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Circos diagram showing trade flows between
    six global economic regions (Asia, Europe, N. America, S. America, Africa, Oceania).
    The circular layout features an outer ring with colored segments representing
    each region - blue for Asia, yellow for Europe, red-coral for N. America, green
    for S. America, purple for Africa, and orange for Oceania. Region labels are positioned
    outside the circle, properly rotated for readability. Inside the outer ring is
    a secondary track showing GDP growth rates as lighter-colored bars of varying
    heights. The center contains semi-transparent ribbons connecting regions, with
    ribbon width proportional to trade flow volume. The ribbons use quadratic bezier
    curves passing through the center. A legend is positioned on the right side with
    colored boxes and region labels. The title "circos-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. At the bottom-left corner, there is small text noting
    "Inner track: GDP Growth (%)".'
