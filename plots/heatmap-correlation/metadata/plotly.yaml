review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent text contrast logic: white text on dark cells, black text on light
    cells (threshold at |r| > 0.5)'
  - Lower triangle masking implemented correctly, reducing visual redundancy
  - Realistic financial data scenario with meaningful correlations (Revenue-Profit
    high, Risk-ROI negative)
  - Proper diverging colorscale (RdBu_r) centered at zero with fixed -1 to 1 range
  - Clean annotation placement with appropriate font sizes
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Good use of colorbar configuration with tick values at -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Variables) rather than more descriptive
  - Could leverage plotlys custom hovertemplate for richer interactive experience
    in HTML version
  - Colorbar title could include more context (e.g., Pearson Correlation instead of
    just Correlation)
