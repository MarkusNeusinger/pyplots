review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully creates a 3D wireframe effect using Highcharts scatter3d with connected
    lines
  - Two-color scheme distinguishes X and Y direction lines effectively
  - Mathematical function z = sin(√(x² + y²)) demonstrates the ripple pattern clearly
  - 3D perspective and frame provide depth perception
  - Title follows the required format convention
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization is poor - plot occupies only ~35% of the image with large empty
    margins
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library as specified in library rules
  - Y-axis label shows Z and Z-axis shows Y which is confusing axis labeling
  - Tick labels and axis labels could be larger for better legibility at full resolution
  - Wireframe lines become very dense and cluttered near the center of the ripple
    pattern
