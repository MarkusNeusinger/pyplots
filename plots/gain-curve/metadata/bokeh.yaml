review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three required curves (model, baseline, perfect
    model)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good color choices that are colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Realistic customer response scenario with appropriate beta distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show exact values on hover (bokeh interactive
    strength)
  - Legend border line is slightly heavy at 2px width
  - Text sizes could be increased slightly for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative gains chart on a light gray background
    (#fafafa). The title "gain-curve · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left
    corner. The X-axis is labeled "Percentage of Population Targeted (%)" and spans
    0-100, while the Y-axis is labeled "Percentage of Positive Cases Captured (%)"
    spanning 0-105. Three curves are shown: (1) a solid blue line (#306998) representing
    the model gain curve with a steep initial slope that rises quickly from 0 to ~90%
    captured within the first 15% of population, then gradually approaches 100%; (2)
    a gray dashed diagonal baseline from (0,0) to (100,100) representing random selection;
    (3) a yellow/gold dotted line showing the perfect model that rises vertically
    to 100% at ~15% population, then stays horizontal. The legend is positioned on
    the right side with clear labels. Subtle dashed grid lines are visible.'
