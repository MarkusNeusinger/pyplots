review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-accessible color scheme (blue/orange instead of green/red)
  - Proper Kagi chart algorithm with shoulder/waist tracking for yang/yin transitions
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing trend type and price
  - Clean code structure with well-commented data generation
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Limited number of visible line transitions (only ~8 indices) - data generation
    could produce more reversal events to better demonstrate the chart type
  - Line width contrast between yang (8) and yin (3) could be more pronounced for
    clearer visual differentiation
  - Price range is narrow (~90-117), which limits the visual impact of the chart
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart with the title "kagi-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The chart shows price movements on the Y-axis
    (labeled "Price ($)") ranging from approximately 90 to 117, and Line Index on
    the X-axis ranging from 0 to 8. The chart uses thick blue lines (#0077BB) for
    Yang (Bullish) segments and thin orange lines (#EE7733) for Yin (Bearish) segments.
    The legend is positioned horizontally above the plot showing both line types.
    The chart demonstrates multiple yang/yin transitions with clear vertical movements
    and horizontal connectors at reversal points. The background is white with subtle
    gray gridlines. The plot effectively shows the characteristic step-like pattern
    of Kagi charts with visible transitions between bullish and bearish states.
