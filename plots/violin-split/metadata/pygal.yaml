review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of XY chart to construct split violin shapes from scratch - demonstrates
    advanced pygal customization
  - Excellent color scheme with Python blue/yellow that provides good contrast and
    colorblind accessibility
  - Well-implemented KDE calculation with Silverman bandwidth selection for smooth
    density curves
  - Quartile markers (IQR lines and median) clearly show statistical summaries within
    each half-violin
  - Clean split violin design where Before/After halves meet at center line as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom shows many unlabeled series entries (small dots) which clutters
    the legend area - consider hiding legend entries for marker series
  - Title uses context-specific wording rather than generic spec description - could
    be "Split Violin Plot" for clarity
