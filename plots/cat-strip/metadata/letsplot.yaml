review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with plant growth across fertilizer treatments showing
    clear differentiation between groups
  - Proper use of geom_jitter with appropriate width parameter to prevent point overlap
  - Clean, publication-quality appearance with well-chosen text sizes and minimal
    theme
  - Smart decision to hide legend since categories are already on x-axis
  - Good use of outliers in Complete group to demonstrate data variation
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for enhanced data exploration
  - Grid lines only on y-axis (x grid disabled) which is appropriate but minor grid
    could add depth
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical strip plot showing plant growth
    measurements (in cm) across five fertilizer treatments: Control, Nitrogen, Phosphorus,
    Potassium, and Complete. Each category has approximately 25 data points displayed
    with horizontal jitter to prevent overlap. The colors are distinct for each category:
    blue for Control, yellow/gold for Nitrogen, green for Phosphorus, purple for Potassium,
    and red/coral for Complete. The y-axis ranges from about 8 to 48 cm. The Control
    group shows the lowest values (roughly 9-20 cm), while the Complete treatment
    shows the highest values with greater spread (roughly 12-48 cm), including visible
    outliers. The title "cat-strip · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis
    labels are clear: "Fertilizer Treatment" on x-axis and "Plant Growth (cm)" on
    y-axis. The background is clean with subtle horizontal grid lines. No legend is
    shown since categories are labeled on the x-axis.'
