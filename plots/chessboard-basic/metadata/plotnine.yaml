review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering
  - Perfect chess board orientation with h1 light square as per standard
  - Classic cream/brown color scheme with excellent contrast
  - Clean, readable algebraic notation labels
  - Proper 1:1 aspect ratio using coord_fixed
  - Professional appearance suitable for chess publications
  weaknesses:
  - VQ-06 scored 0/2 because axis labels are empty, though this is appropriate for
    a chess board (no units apply)
  image_description: The plot displays a classic 8x8 chess board with alternating
    cream (#F0D9B5) and brown (#B58863) squares. The board is correctly oriented with
    the light square at h1 (bottom-right corner) as per standard chess convention.
    Column labels (a-h) appear along the bottom x-axis, and row labels (1-8) are on
    the left y-axis. The title "chessboard-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is prominently
    displayed at the top in bold. A subtle brown border frames the entire board. The
    squares have thin border lines enhancing visual separation. The 1:1 aspect ratio
    is maintained, making all squares perfectly square-shaped.
