review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme (blue-white-red) with proper midpoint at 0
  - Clear cell annotations with bold text for easy reading
  - Realistic financial metrics dataset with meaningful correlations
  - Proper use of coord_fixed() for square tiles
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML output
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No upper/lower triangle masking (spec mentions this as optional but would enhance)
  - Axis labels are generic "Financial Metric" rather than more descriptive
  - Legend could be slightly more prominent
  image_description: The plot displays an 8×8 correlation matrix heatmap for financial
    metrics. The heatmap uses a diverging color scheme with blue (#2166AC) for negative
    correlations, white for zero, and red (#B2182B) for positive correlations. Each
    cell contains bold black text showing the correlation coefficient to 2 decimal
    places. The diagonal shows 1.00 values (self-correlation) in deep red. Variables
    include Revenue, Marketing, Employees, Satisfaction, Profit, Market Share, Innovation,
    and Debt Ratio. The x-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees. A colorbar legend labeled
    "Correlation" appears on the right side with range -1 to 1. The title "heatmap-correlation
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_tile, scale_fill_gradient2,
          coord_fixed; includes interactive tooltips in HTML output. Could have used
          more advanced lets-plot features like ggtb() for tooltip builder or faceting
  verdict: APPROVED
