review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and elements
  - Correct horizontal orientation choice given category label lengths
  - Beautiful color scheme with high contrast (blue/yellow)
  - Clean minimalist aesthetic with removed spines
  - Data sorted by value for easy comparison
  - Proper use of units in axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Could add subtle value annotations at the markers to enhance readability
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib for stems rather than seaborn-specific features
