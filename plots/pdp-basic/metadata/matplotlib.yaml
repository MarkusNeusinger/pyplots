review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PDP with ICE lines using sklearn partial_dependence
    function with kind=both
  - Proper confidence band visualization using fill_between with mean ± 1.96*std
  - Rug plot effectively shows training data distribution along x-axis
  - Clean, readable code that follows KISS principles
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme with Python blue and yellow
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper left slightly overlaps with ICE lines - consider frameon=True
    with white background
  - Rug plot markers (s=100) could be larger (s=150-200) for better visibility on
    high-resolution canvas
  - Y-axis range dominated by wide confidence band making PDP line variation appear
    minimal
