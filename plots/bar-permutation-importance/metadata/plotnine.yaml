review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and proper font hierarchy
  - Complete spec compliance with all required features (error bars, color gradient,
    reference line, sorted bars)
  - Realistic customer churn prediction scenario with sensible feature names
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotnine grammar of graphics idioms
  - Good color palette choice (yellow-blue) that is colorblind accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use Score Decrease or similar context)
  - Library features score is modest - could leverage more plotnine-specific features
  - Horizontal grid lines (panel_grid_major_y) show through bars which adds visual
    noise for a horizontal bar chart
