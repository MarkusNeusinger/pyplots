  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing throughout - all elements perfectly legible at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Well-chosen realistic business scenario (tech company market performance) with
    appropriate data ranges
  - Good use of Bokeh's ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for clean data binding
  - Proper styling with subtle grid, good color choice, and appropriate marker sizing
    for the data density
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Missing connecting lines/arrows from labels to points as specified in the notes
    section of the specification
  - Some label pairs are close together (ByteWorks/CyberLink, SoftPeak/NetFlow) -
    could benefit from collision avoidance
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's distinctive hover tooltip feature which would enhance
    the visualization
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with 15 blue circular markers
    representing tech companies, plotted on a light gray background (#fafafa). The
    x-axis shows "Revenue (Billions $)" ranging from approximately 4 to 26, and the
    y-axis shows "Market Cap (Billions $)" ranging from approximately 18 to 100. Each
    data point has a bold text label positioned to the upper-right of the marker,
    displaying company names like "WebScale", "CloudNet", "TechCorp", etc. The title
    "scatter-annotated · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. A subtle
    dashed grid (alpha 0.3) provides reference lines. The markers use a Python blue
    color (#306998) with ~0.7 alpha and darker outlines. The plot shows a clear positive
    correlation between revenue and market cap.
