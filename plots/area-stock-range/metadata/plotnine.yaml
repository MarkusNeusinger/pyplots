review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of facet_wrap to simulate a two-panel range selector concept in a
    static plotting library
  - Excellent data generation with realistic stock price behavior including trends,
    volatility clusters, and corrections
  - Clean implementation of selection highlighting with geom_rect and geom_vline in
    the overview panel
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_ribbon for area fill and
    geom_line for price line
  - Good adherence to code quality standards with proper seed, KISS structure, and
    clean imports
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too prominent (alpha ~0.5 vs recommended 0.2-0.4), making the plot
    appear busier than necessary
  - The specification requires interactive range selection features that plotnine
    fundamentally cannot provide; the static faceted approach is a reasonable workaround
    but does not fully satisfy the spec requirements for preset ranges and custom
    date selection
  - Missing legend/annotation explaining that the bottom panel represents a range
    selector and the shaded area indicates the selected timeframe
  image_description: 'The plot displays a two-panel stock area chart with a range
    selector concept implemented using plotnine''s faceting. The top panel shows the
    "Selected Range: Apr-Oct 2023 (6M)" with a filled area chart in a muted blue color
    (#306998) with ~40% opacity, displaying stock prices ranging from approximately
    $180 to $260. The bottom panel shows "Range Selector · Full History" spanning
    from January 2022 to January 2024, with prices ranging from ~$120 to $260. The
    selected range in the overview panel is highlighted with a light blue shaded rectangle
    and navy blue dashed vertical lines marking the selection boundaries. Both panels
    use proper axis labels: "Stock Price (USD)" on the y-axis with dollar formatting,
    and "Date" on the x-axis with month-year formatting (angled at 45 degrees). The
    title correctly uses the format "area-stock-range · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The
    overall color scheme is consistent, using Python blue tones. Grid lines are visible
    but subtle, and the strip backgrounds are light gray.'

        comment: All text clearly readable. Title at 24pt, axis labels at 20pt, tick
          labels at 16pt. Rotated x-axis labels could benefit from more spacing.

          Selection highlight in overview is well-executed.

        comment: Spec requires preset ranges and custom date selection. Implementation
          shows only one static 6M selection. Plotnine is not interactive, so this
          is a fundamental limitation.
