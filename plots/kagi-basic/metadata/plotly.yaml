review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - 'Good use of Plotly features: hover templates showing trend type and price, interactive
    legend, HTML export'
  - Colorblind-accessible color palette (blue/orange instead of red/green)
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  - Correct Kagi chart construction logic for building step patterns
  weaknesses:
  - 'Yang/yin logic flaw: The chart shows only ONE yang segment at the start, then
    ALL subsequent segments are yin. The yang_yin determination logic needs revision
    - it should show multiple yang segments when price breaks above previous highs
    during recovery phases'
  - The 5 distinct trending phases in the data (uptrend, downtrend, strong uptrend,
    consolidation, recovery) should produce visible yang/yin transitions, but only
    the initial drop triggers a yin state that never recovers to yang
  - Legend colors appear inconsistent with actual line colors in the rendered image
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Kagi chart with the title "kagi-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The chart has a white background with subtle gray gridlines. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately 82 to 110, and the X-axis shows "Line Index" from 0 to about 12. A legend appears in the upper left showing "Yang (Bullish)" as a thick green line and "Yin (Bearish)" as a thin red/coral line.

    Critical observation: The chart shows only ONE thick green (yang/bullish) vertical line segment at line index 0-1, dropping from ~110 to ~82. ALL subsequent line segments (indices 1-12) are thin red/coral (yin/bearish) lines forming a step pattern oscillating between ~82 and ~108. This does NOT correctly demonstrate the yang/yin transitions that define Kagi charts - there should be multiple transitions between thick and thin lines as price breaks above previous highs or below previous lows.
