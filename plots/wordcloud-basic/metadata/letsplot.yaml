review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent collision detection algorithm ensures no overlapping words
  - Clean visual hierarchy with Python clearly dominant as the most frequent term
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good variety and contrast
  - Realistic programming language popularity data that users will recognize
  - Proper use of theme_void() for clean word cloud appearance
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced word distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Custom word placement algorithm is complex but necessary since lets-plot lacks
    native word cloud support
  - Elixir text appears slightly small compared to other low-frequency words
