review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for all elements
  - Clear, realistic A/B test scenario with plausible conversion rate data
  - Error bar caps are clearly visible with good sizing (capsize=10, capthick=3)
  - Clean annotation explaining what error bars represent (95% CI requirement from
    spec)
  - Good color choice with consistent dark blue theme
  - KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars are all symmetric; demonstrating asymmetric errors would better showcase
    the plot type capabilities
  - Annotation box placement in bottom-right corner floats in empty space rather than
    being more integrated with the plot
  - Basic library usage without leveraging advanced matplotlib features like bar_label()
    for showing values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart with 5 blue vertical bars representing
    A/B test groups (Control, Variant A, Variant B, Variant C, Variant D). Each bar
    has dark blue error bars with visible caps extending above and below the bar tops.
    The bars use a consistent blue color (#306998) with darker edge color (#1e4466).
    The y-axis shows "Conversion Rate (%)" ranging from 0 to approximately 24, and
    the x-axis shows "Test Group". The title follows the required format "bar-error
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A small annotation box in the bottom-right corner
    states "Error bars: 95% CI". The grid is subtle with horizontal dashed lines at
    alpha 0.3.'

        comment: Uses ax.bar() and ax.errorbar() correctly, but these are basic matplotlib
          features. Could have used more advanced features like bar_label() for value
          annotations or customized error bar styling
  verdict: APPROVED
