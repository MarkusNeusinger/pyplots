review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PDP using real sklearn partial_dependence computation
  - Proper confidence interval calculation from ICE curves (mean ± 1.96*std)
  - Clean rug plot implementation using geom_segment showing training data distribution
  - Professional appearance with appropriate color scheme and typography
  - Follows plotnine grammar of graphics idiomatically
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain what the shaded confidence band represents
  - The confidence band is very wide, visually overwhelming the actual trend line
  - Rug marks are positioned slightly below the plot area rather than at the axis
