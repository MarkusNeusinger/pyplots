review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly.express built-in marginal distribution feature (px.scatter
    with marginal_x/marginal_y)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output (title 32pt, axis labels 24pt, ticks 18pt)
  - Good marker styling with appropriate opacity (0.65) and edge outline
  - Consistent color scheme between scatter markers and histogram bars
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Well-aligned marginal plots with main scatter area
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or more descriptive context
  - Could use a more realistic data scenario instead of abstract random data
  image_description: 'The plot shows a scatter plot with marginal histogram distributions.
    The main scatter plot occupies the lower-left portion with blue circular markers
    (color #306998) showing a positive correlation between X Value (ranging ~20-80)
    and Y Value (ranging ~20-85). The top marginal histogram shows the X distribution
    with approximately normal shape centered around 50. The right marginal histogram
    shows the Y distribution, also roughly normal. The title "scatter-marginal · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray text. All text is clearly readable,
    axis labels show "X Value" and "Y Value", tick labels are visible on all axes,
    and the overall layout is clean with a white background and subtle gray grid lines.'
