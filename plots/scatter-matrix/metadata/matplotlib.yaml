review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the scatter plot matrix with clear visual separation
    of species clusters
  - Proper use of GridSpec for tight subplot spacing creating a cohesive matrix appearance
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.6 for scatter, 0.7 for histograms) to
    handle overlapping points
  - Clean axis label placement with labels only on edges (left and bottom)
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with good contrast
  - Realistic Iris-like data with biologically plausible parameters
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-right subplot overlaps with scatter data in that cell;
    consider placing legend outside the matrix or in a dedicated area
  - Scatter marker size (s=70) is adequate but could be slightly larger for better
    visibility given the data density
  - Could leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like shared axes linking or
    colorbar for additional encoding
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix using the classic
    Iris flower dataset structure with four measurements: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal
    Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). The diagonal cells contain
    overlapping histograms showing the distribution of each variable, with three species
    color-coded: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica
    (green #4CAF50). Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots for each variable pair,
    clearly revealing the characteristic clustering patterns (Setosa well-separated
    from the other two species, especially in petal measurements). The legend is positioned
    in the top-right subplot. Axis labels with units appear on the left and bottom
    edges. A subtle dashed grid (alpha=0.3) appears in each subplot. The title follows
    the required format at the top.'

        comment: Uses basic GridSpec and manual loop; could use plt.subplots() more
          efficiently but doesn't leverage any advanced matplotlib features
