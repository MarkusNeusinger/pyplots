review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of Venn diagram using pygal XY chart with filled circles
  - All 7 regions correctly calculated and labeled with accurate counts
  - Good transparency (0.4) clearly shows overlapping regions
  - Colorblind-friendly palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - Legend includes total set sizes which adds helpful context
  - Mathematically correct calculation of exclusive regions from set sizes and overlaps
  weaknesses:
  - Set labels Product A and Product B are cut off at the top canvas edges despite
    increased margins
  - Product C label below bottom circle may be positioned slightly outside optimal
    viewing area
  - Circle boundaries extend slightly beyond the canvas on the right side for Product
    B
