review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using pygal HorizontalBar as base with custom SVG
    injection for Gantt-specific features
  - Clear dependency visualization with elbow connectors and arrowheads
  - Good use of color coding for phases with colorblind-safe palette
  - Interactive tooltips showing task details including duration and dependencies
  - Professional layout with month markers and explanatory legend note
  weaknesses:
  - Task labels on y-axis could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Dependency arrow stroke width is somewhat thin at 2px
  - Title includes extra text before required format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart showing a Software Project Timeline
    with 16 tasks organized across 5 phases (Requirements, Design, Development, Testing,
    Deployment). Each task is represented as a horizontal bar with rounded corners,
    color-coded by phase: blue for Requirements, yellow for Design, teal/cyan for
    Development, red for Testing, and purple for Deployment. The x-axis shows the
    timeline from January 2025 to May 2025 with vertical dashed guide lines at month
    boundaries. Task names appear on the left y-axis. Dependency arrows (gray elbow
    connectors with arrowheads) connect the end of predecessor tasks to the start
    of successor tasks, clearly showing finish-to-start relationships. A legend at
    the bottom identifies the phase colors, and a small note in the top-right corner
    explains that arrows indicate task dependencies. The title follows the required
    format: "Software Project Timeline · gantt-dependencies · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
