review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar coordinates in Altair despite lack of native
    polar support
  - Clean manual construction of polar gridlines (circles and spokes) as separate
    chart layers
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Realistic wind data with meaningful prevailing directions and appropriate speed
    distributions
  - Well-formatted direction labels with both cardinal names and degree values
  weaknesses:
  - Missing traditional axis labels - while direction/radius labels exist, could add
    descriptive text like Wind Speed (m/s) near radius labels
  - Does not leverage Altair interactive features (zoom, pan, brush selection) which
    are a key library strength
  - Some point overlap in dense clusters could be improved with slightly smaller markers
    or stronger alpha
