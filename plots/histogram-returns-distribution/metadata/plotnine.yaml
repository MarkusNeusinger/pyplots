review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements with normal distribution
    overlay, statistics box, and tail highlighting
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layer composition (histogram
    + line + vlines + annotation)
  - Realistic financial data simulation with mixture of normals to create fat-tailed
    distribution
  - Statistics box well-positioned and clearly formatted with white background
  - Title correctly formatted per pyplots.ai standards
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (alpha on major grid lines would improve appearance)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns distribution
    with 30 bins. The histogram bars are colored by region: yellow for the center
    (within 2 standard deviations), red for the left tail (below -2σ), and green for
    the right tail (above +2σ). A blue normal distribution curve is overlaid on the
    histogram for comparison. A black dashed vertical line marks the mean. Two red
    dotted vertical lines mark the ±2σ boundaries. A statistics text box in the upper
    right shows Mean: 0.01%, Std: 1.82%, Skewness: 0.25, and Kurtosis: 3.61. The x-axis
    is labeled "Daily Returns (%)" ranging from -10 to 10, and the y-axis is labeled
    "Frequency" ranging from 0 to about 45. The title correctly follows the format
    "histogram-returns-distribution · plotnine · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right
    shows the three region categories.'
