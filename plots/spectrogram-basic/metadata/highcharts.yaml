review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chirp signal visualization clearly demonstrating time-frequency representation
  - Proper use of viridis-inspired colormap for perceptual uniformity and accessibility
  - Good axis labels with units (seconds, Hz)
  - Smart downsampling to handle Highcharts heatmap performance limitations
  - Clean code structure following library rules for Selenium-based PNG export
  - Interactive HTML version also generated for web viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar shows normalized 0-100 values instead of actual dB values (could preserve
    original scale in tooltip or axis)
  - Legend title Power (dB, normalized) appears slightly cramped on the right edge
  - No consideration of log frequency scale option mentioned in specification notes
