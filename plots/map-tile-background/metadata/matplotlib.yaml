review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent tile fetching implementation with proper OSM User-Agent and attribution
  - Good use of dual encoding (size + color) for visitor data
  - Proper coordinate formatting with degree symbols
  - Well-positioned context annotation and attribution
  - Good contrast with white marker edges against map background
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions violate KISS principle (should be flat script structure)
  - No grid overlay (though acceptable for map visualization)
  - Tick label font size slightly below recommended 16pt
  image_description: 'The plot displays a map of Rome, Italy with OpenStreetMap tile
    background showing street-level detail including roads, parks (green areas), and
    the Tiber River. Twelve tourist attractions are plotted as circular markers with
    both size and color encoding: marker size represents visitor volume, and color
    uses a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red) sequential colormap indicating daily visitors
    in thousands (ranging from ~2000 to ~7000). The largest/reddest markers appear
    at the Colosseum (bottom right) and Vatican area (left side). A colorbar on the
    right shows the color scale labeled "Daily Visitors (thousands)". The top-left
    contains an annotation box explaining "Rome Tourist Attractions / Marker size
    = visitor volume". The bottom-right shows required OSM attribution "© OpenStreetMap
    contributors". Axis labels show "Longitude" and "Latitude" with coordinate formatting
    (e.g., 12.450°E, 41.900°N). Title follows the required format "map-tile-background
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
