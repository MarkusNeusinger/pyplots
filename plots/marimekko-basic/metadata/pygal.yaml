review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex chart type that pygal does not natively
    support
  - Creative use of pygal Graph base class to build a custom Marimekko chart
  - Variable-width bars correctly proportional to column totals (market sizes)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with percentage labels inside larger segments
  - Width percentages shown below region labels enhance understanding
  - Good color scheme with white stroke separating segments
  - Proper use of pygal Style system for consistent typography
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly {spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai without the
    Market Share by Region prefix
  - Uses custom class which technically violates KISS structure guidelines
  - Missing Y-axis percentage scale or label for reference
