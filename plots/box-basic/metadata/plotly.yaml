review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance — all required features (median, outliers, whiskers, per-category
    colors) are present
  - Excellent code quality — clean KISS structure, seed set, no unnecessary imports,
    elegant dict comprehension for clipping
  - Realistic salary data with appropriate sample sizes and natural variation between
    departments
  - Good use of Plotly-specific features (hovertemplate, HTML export)
  - All font sizes explicitly set meeting legibility requirements
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two similar blue tones (#306998 Engineering, #4B8BBE Sales) reduce color distinctiveness
    — replace one with a more contrasting color'
  - No data storytelling — add annotations highlighting key insights (e.g., median
    salary differences, the high outlier in Sales, Engineering premium over other
    departments)
  - Significant empty vertical whitespace above the data — tighten the y-axis range
    or let it auto-scale more efficiently
  - Visual refinement is minimal beyond plotly_white defaults — consider adding subtle
    enhancements like box fill opacity variation or styled whisker caps
  - No visual emphasis or hierarchy among the departments to guide the viewer eye
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one for each department: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, and Finance. Each
    box is a distinct color — Engineering in muted steel blue (#306998), Marketing
    in peach/orange (#E07B42), Sales in light blue (#4B8BBE), HR in soft purple (#8B6DAF),
    and Finance in sage green (#2D9B6E). The y-axis shows "Annual Salary ($)" ranging
    from $20,000 to $140,000 with dollar-formatted tick labels. The x-axis shows "Department".
    Median lines are clearly visible within each box. Whiskers extend from each box
    to the data range. Two outliers are visible: one below Engineering (~$57,000)
    and one well above Sales (~$147,000). The title "box-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The background uses plotly_white template with subtle
    horizontal gridlines. The layout is clean with no legend (category names serve
    as x-axis labels).'
