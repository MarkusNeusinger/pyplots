review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent collision detection algorithm ensures no overlapping words
  - Clean visual hierarchy with Python clearly dominant as the most frequent term
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good variety and contrast
  - Realistic programming language popularity data that users will recognize
  - Proper use of theme_void() for clean word cloud appearance
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced word distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Custom word placement algorithm is complex but necessary since lets-plot lacks
    native word cloud support
  - Elixir text appears slightly small compared to other low-frequency words
  image_description: 'The word cloud displays 26 programming language names arranged
    in a spiral pattern on a white background. The title "wordcloud-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in gray text. Word sizes vary according
    to frequency, with "Python" being the largest (most prominent, displayed in bold
    blue #306998), followed by "JavaScript" (large, in yellow #FFD43B), "Java" (cyan),
    "TypeScript" (yellow), and "HTML" (pink/magenta). Smaller words like "Elixir",
    "Lua", "Clojure" appear at the edges. The color palette cycles through 8 colors:
    blue, yellow, green, pink, cyan, orange, purple, and gray. All words use bold
    font and are clearly legible with no overlapping. The layout is well-balanced
    with words distributed across the canvas.'

        comment: Uses geom_text with scale_size_identity and scale_color_manual; theme_void
          is appropriate; however, word clouds are not a native lets-plot feature,
          so implementation requires custom placement algorithm
  verdict: APPROVED
