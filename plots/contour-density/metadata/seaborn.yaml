review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot for 2D kernel density estimation with both filled
    and line contours
  - Two-cluster data effectively demonstrates density visualization capabilities
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility and visual appeal
  - Scatter overlay adds context without cluttering the visualization
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No colorbar/legend to show the density scale mapping
  - Generic axis labels (X Variable, Y Variable) rather than a real-world scenario
