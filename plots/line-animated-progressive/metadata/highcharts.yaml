review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing for 4800×2700 canvas
  - Clean sinusoidal temperature pattern demonstrates the animation concept effectively
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Proper use of Highcharts datetime axis with custom formatting
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the progressive animation; consider adding visual
    indicator of progression direction
  - Uses raw dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python classes
  - Legend could include more context
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing monthly average temperature
    data from January 2019 to late 2023. The line is rendered in a deep blue color
    (#306998) with yellow circular markers (#FFD43B) at each data point. The chart
    clearly shows a sinusoidal seasonal pattern with temperatures oscillating between
    approximately -5°C in winter months and +30°C in summer months. The title "line-animated-progressive
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle explaining
    the data context. The x-axis shows dates labeled by month and year (e.g., "Jan
    2019", "Oct 2019"), while the y-axis displays temperature in degrees Celsius with
    labels from -6°C to 31°C. A subtle grid is visible in the background. The layout
    is clean with good margins, and all text is clearly legible.
