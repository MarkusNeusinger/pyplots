review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alternating y-positions for event labels to avoid
    overlap
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach with well-layered geoms (line → vline → point
    → text)
  - 'Appropriate use of the Python color scheme (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow)'
  - Good text sizing following the library guidelines (24pt title, 20pt axis labels,
    16pt ticks)
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with meaningful event annotations
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Daily Visitors (count)")
  - Event markers at alternating heights work well but the fixed y_offset values (0.85,
    0.92) could be slightly higher to give more separation from the data line peaks
