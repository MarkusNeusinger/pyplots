review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all elements clearly legible at full resolution
  - Clean, professional styling with removed spines and subtle gridlines
  - Value labels above bars enhance readability and follow spec recommendation
  - Proper use of seaborn DataFrame integration with pandas
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate more variation in data values to better showcase comparison
    capabilities
  - Does not leverage seaborn-specific features beyond basic barplot (e.g., error
    bars, hue encoding for highlighting)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product sales
    by category. Six blue bars (#306998) represent categories: Electronics (145),
    Clothing (98), Home & Garden (76), Sports (112), Books (54), and Toys (89). Bold
    value labels appear above each bar. The title "bar-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is positioned at the top. The y-axis shows "Sales (units)" and x-axis shows "Product
    Category". The chart has a clean design with removed top/right spines and subtle
    dashed gridlines on the y-axis. All text is clearly legible and well-sized.'
