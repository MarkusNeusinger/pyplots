review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the feature importance bar chart with proper sorting
    (highest at top)
  - Clear gradient color mapping that visually emphasizes feature importance levels
  - Data labels positioned cleanly at the end of each bar for precise value reading
  - Realistic house price prediction scenario with meaningful feature names
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Clean, professional appearance suitable for publication
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are overly dense (increments of 0.005 create visual clutter)
  - Contains a helper function importance_to_color() which deviates slightly from
    KISS structure
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library as recommended in library rules
  - Error bars not included despite spec mentioning them as valuable for ensemble
    methods
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing feature importances
    from a Random Forest model for house price prediction. There are 15 features displayed,
    sorted from highest importance at the top (Square Footage with 0.215) to lowest
    at the bottom (Energy Efficiency Score with 0.004). The bars use a gradient color
    scheme from dark blue (#306998 for high importance) to light blue (#a8d5f2 for
    low importance). Each bar has a data label showing the precise importance value
    positioned just to the right of the bar. The title "bar-feature-importance · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top with a subtitle "House Price Prediction -
    Random Forest Feature Importances" below it. The x-axis shows "Importance Score"
    ranging from 0 to 0.25. Feature names (e.g., "Square Footage", "Number of Bedrooms",
    "Location Score") are clearly displayed on the y-axis. The chart has a clean white
    background with subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Good use of canvas space, though the right side has significant whitespace
          due to the x-axis extending to 0.25 while max value is 0.215

          are unitless, so this is acceptable)

        comment: Shows 15 features with good variation in importance values; however,

        comment: Uses Highcharts bar chart with data labels and custom styling; however,
          does not use highcharts-core Python library as suggested in the library
          rules, instead builds JSON config manually
  verdict: APPROVED
