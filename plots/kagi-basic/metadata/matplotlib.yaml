review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Kagi chart algorithm implementation with correct yang/yin logic and
    reversal threshold handling
  - Clear visual distinction between bullish (thick green) and bearish (thin red)
    segments
  - Good annotation showing the reversal threshold parameter
  - Realistic stock price data generation using geometric Brownian motion
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme is not colorblind-friendly (though thickness provides secondary
    cue)
  - Could use LineCollection for more efficient segment rendering instead of individual
    plot calls
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kagi chart showing stock price movements
    over time. The chart uses thick green lines (Yang/Bullish) and thin red lines
    (Yin/Bearish) to represent trend directions. The price range spans approximately
    $83-$108, with the X-axis showing "Kagi Line Index" from 0 to ~13. The title correctly
    displays "kagi-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in large font at the top. A legend
    in the upper left corner identifies the two line types. An annotation box in the
    lower right shows "Reversal threshold: 4%". The chart demonstrates multiple trend
    reversals with clear yang-to-yin and yin-to-yang transitions, including horizontal
    shoulder/waist segments at reversal points. The grid is subtle with dashed lines
    at 0.3 alpha.'
