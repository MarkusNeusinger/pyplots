quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear stepped area chart representation of
    the PR curve
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette using blue and yellow
  - AP score prominently displayed in both subtitle and legend
  - Baseline reference line correctly positioned at positive class ratio
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features (AreaSeries with step, custom margins)
  - Clean HTML export with embedded Highcharts JS for reliable rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions instead of following KISS principle (inline code
    preferred)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity)
