review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized fonts and stepped line visualization
  - Well-implemented comparison of two classifiers with different performance levels
  - Baseline reference line clearly shows random classifier performance at the positive
    class ratio
  - Realistic fraud detection scenario with appropriate 10% class imbalance
  - Good use of fill_between to show area under curves, enhancing visual distinction
  - Clean, maintainable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; primarily uses matplotlib drawing functions
  - Could benefit from a third classifier curve to show fuller performance spectrum
    (poor performer)
