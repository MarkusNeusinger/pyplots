review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly sizeref/sizemode for idiomatic area-based bubble scaling
  - Dual encoding of market share via both size and color creates rich visual information
    density
  - Custom hovertemplate with formatted HTML tooltips and write_html for interactive
    version alongside static PNG
  - Size legend with three representative bubble sizes (5%, 15%, 30%) helps reader
    decode the visualization
  - All font sizes explicitly set and appropriately scaled for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic business context with sensible data ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Lightest bubbles (low market share ~2-5%) are nearly white against the white background,
    reducing visibility and contrast — consider a colorscale where the lightest value
    still has sufficient contrast
  - Right side of the chart is crowded with both a size legend and a colorbar, pushing
    the data area leftward and creating layout imbalance
  - Data storytelling could be stronger — the chart displays data without guiding
    the viewer to specific insights or creating clear focal points
  - No distinct clusters or notable outliers in the synthetic data to make the visualization
    more engaging
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart titled "bubble-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. Approximately 40 bubbles are scattered across
    the chart area. The x-axis shows "Revenue ($ millions)" ranging from ~15 to ~82,
    and the y-axis shows "Growth Rate (%)" ranging from ~0 to ~42. Bubble sizes represent
    market share (with a size legend in the top-right showing reference bubbles at
    5%, 15%, and 30%). Bubble color is also mapped to market share via a sequential
    blue colorscale — very light/nearly white for low values (~3-5%) through medium
    steel blue to dark navy for high values (~30%+). A vertical colorbar on the right
    displays "Market Share (%)" from ~5 to ~30+. Bubbles have white edge borders (line
    width 1.5) and ~75% opacity. The background is clean white (plotly_white template)
    with subtle gray gridlines. The right margin accommodates both the size legend
    and colorbar. Data shows a general positive correlation between revenue and growth
    rate, with good variation in bubble sizes across the chart.
