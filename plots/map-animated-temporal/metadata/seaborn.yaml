review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent earthquake aftershock narrative showing temporal diffusion from epicenter
  - Good use of small multiples approach for temporal visualization in a static library
  - Viridis colormap with dual encoding (color + size) for magnitude is effective
  - Geographic context with simplified coastline adds realism
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend partially cut off at bottom right edge of figure
  - Could benefit from a size legend showing magnitude scale
  - Consider using seaborn FacetGrid for more native small-multiples implementation
  image_description: The plot displays a 2x3 small multiples grid showing earthquake
    aftershock data over 6 days (Day 1 through Day 6). Each panel shows a scatter
    plot with longitude on the x-axis (°W) and latitude on the y-axis (°N), covering
    the California coastal region. Points are colored using a viridis colormap representing
    earthquake magnitude (2.0-5.5 scale), with point size also encoding magnitude.
    A simplified brown California coastline provides geographic context. A red star
    marks the epicenter at approximately (35°N, -120°W). The temporal progression
    clearly shows aftershocks spreading outward from the epicenter over time, with
    more points appearing in later days. A shared colorbar on the right shows the
    Magnitude scale. A legend in the lower right identifies the Epicenter marker and
    Coastline. The title correctly uses the format "map-animated-temporal · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai".
