review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D isometric projection with clear depth perception using geom_polygon
    for bar faces
  - Good use of viridis color scale reinforcing z-values for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean separation of product categories and quarters with readable labels
  - Interactive tooltips provide rich data exploration when viewing HTML export
  - Well-structured code with proper depth sorting for correct face rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Product labels on left side appear stacked vertically rather than aligned with
    their corresponding bar rows in the 3D space
