review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title formatting matching the required spec format
  - Clean realistic data scenario with CPU usage showing daily cycles and anomalies
  - Good implementation of core interactive features (zoom, crosshair, tooltips)
  - Proper colorblind-safe color choice (#306998)
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Appropriate font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Missing Highcharts navigator/range selector which would enhance interactivity
    for time series
  - Legend marker at bottom is quite small
  - Uses raw dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python wrapper classes
