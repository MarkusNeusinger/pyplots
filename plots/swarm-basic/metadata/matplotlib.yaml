review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom swarm positioning algorithm that creates proper beeswarm spread
  - Clean, realistic data context (employee performance by department)
  - Mean markers add valuable summary statistics as suggested in spec
  - Proper font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good color palette that is accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Performance Score (0-100)")
  - Legend is redundant - departments already labeled on x-axis, only Mean marker
    needs explanation
  - For ~190 data points, marker size s=150 causes some visual density in centers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm plot (beeswarm plot) showing employee
    performance scores across 4 departments: Engineering (blue), Sales (yellow), Marketing
    (green), and Support (orange/coral). Individual data points are spread horizontally
    to avoid overlap, clearly showing the distribution shape for each category. Each
    department has 40-55 points with different distributions - Marketing clusters
    highest (~80), Engineering mid-high (~78), Sales spread (~72 with outliers down
    to ~33), and Support lower (~68). Diamond markers show the mean for each group.
    The title follows the required format "swarm-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    Axis labels are "Department" and "Performance Score". A legend in the upper right
    identifies categories and the mean marker. Grid lines are subtle (y-axis only).'

        comment: Custom swarm positioning algorithm is clever but matplotlib doesn't
          have a native swarm plot function - this is a workaround using scatter().
          Seaborn would be the natural choice here. The implementation correctly uses
          ax methods over plt.
  verdict: APPROVED
