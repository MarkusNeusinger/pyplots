review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution in Online group showcasing violin
    plot capability
  - Clean embedded box plots with visible median, quartiles, and whiskers
  - Mean lines (red) add extra statistical information beyond spec requirements
  - Realistic education scenario with plausible test score distributions
  - Proper output sizing (4800x2700) with readable fonts
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 makes gridlines very faint; could use 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - Outlier markers are small (size 8); increasing to 10-12 would improve visibility
  - Yellow color for Interactive group may have reduced contrast for some colorblind
