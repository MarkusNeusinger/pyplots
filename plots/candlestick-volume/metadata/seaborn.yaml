  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 75/25 height ratio as specified
  - Good color scheme using Python blue/yellow that is colorblind accessible
  - Clean seaborn styling with whitegrid and talk context provides professional appearance
  - Realistic stock data generation with price-volume correlation
  - Well-formatted axis labels with units and proper tick formatting for millions
  weaknesses:
  - Crosshair feature appears in code but is not visible in the rendered output image
  - Legend placement in upper left may overlap with price data in some scenarios
  - Volume axis label shows just Volume instead of Volume (M shares) as coded
