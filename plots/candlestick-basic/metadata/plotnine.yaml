review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation using geom_segment for wicks and geom_rect for bodies
    - creative use of plotnine grammar
  - Clean readable code with proper KISS structure
  - Realistic stock price simulation with random walk model
  - Good visual styling with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red color scheme is standard for finance but not colorblind-accessible;
    consider using blue/orange or shapes
  - X-axis shows numeric Trading Day instead of actual dates which would be more informative
  image_description: 'The plot displays a candlestick chart with 30 trading days of
    simulated stock data. Green (teal, #22ab94) candles represent bullish days (close
    >= open) and red (#f23645) candles represent bearish days (close < open). Each
    candlestick has a rectangular body showing the open-close range and thin black
    wicks showing the high-low range. The x-axis shows "Trading Day" (0-30), the y-axis
    shows "Price ($)" ranging approximately from 132 to 155. The title "candlestick-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The background is minimal with
    subtle gray gridlines. The overall trend shows a price decline from ~150 to ~135
    over the 30-day period.'

          since colors are self-explanatory for candlesticks

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_segment + geom_rect)
          but this is a workaround approach rather than leveraging plotnine's statistical
          transformations or faceting capabilities
  verdict: APPROVED
