review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal extensibility by creating a custom FilledContour class
    that extends Graph
  - Implements proper marching squares algorithm for contour line generation
  - Diverging blue-white-red colormap effectively shows positive and negative values
  - Good color interpolation for smooth gradient transitions between levels
  - Colorbar with gradient segments provides clear value mapping
  - Multiple Gaussian peaks demonstrate the full range of contour visualization capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure violates KISS principle by using a complex class with many methods
    instead of simple linear code
  - sys.path manipulation is a workaround that adds complexity and potential fragility
  - Colorbar label is just z instead of a more descriptive label
  - Cell-based rendering creates slightly pixelated appearance compared to true contour
    algorithms
