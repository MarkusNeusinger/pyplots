review:
  strengths:
  - Professional dual-pane layout with correct 75%/25% vertical split between price
    and volume
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
    instead of red-green
  - Volume bars correctly colored to match candlesticks for visual consistency
  - Clean seaborn styling with whitegrid and talk context for readability
  - Properly formatted date axis with bi-weekly Monday labels
  weaknesses:
  - Missing crosshair/cursor spanning both panes as specified in requirements
  - Does not use seaborn plotting functions - only uses sns.set_style() and sns.set_context()
    for styling while actual plotting is done with matplotlib ax.bar() and ax.plot()
  - Grid lines are not aligned across both panes - they use different scales and do
    not share visual alignment
