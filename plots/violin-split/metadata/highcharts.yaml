quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of areasplinerange series to create smooth split violin shapes
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction
  - Realistic employee satisfaction dataset with meaningful variations across departments
  - Clean integration of median markers as scatter points
  - Proper title format and descriptive subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a function (compute_kde) which violates the KISS structure requirement
  - Missing inner box plot or quartile markers that the spec suggested as an option
  - Y-axis is inverted (1 at top) which may be counterintuitive for satisfaction scores
