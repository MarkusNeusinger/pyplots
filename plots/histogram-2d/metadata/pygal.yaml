review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a custom 2D histogram chart type by extending pygal
    Graph class, demonstrating deep library knowledge
  - Viridis colormap with smooth color interpolation provides excellent perceptual
    uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic, relatable data scenario (customer age vs annual purchase frequency)
    with two distinct clusters showing density variation
  - Proper colorbar with tick marks and labels for interpreting density values
  - Clean SVG generation with border, axis labels, and proper text formatting
  - HTML output included for interactivity viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Code violates KISS principle by using a custom class instead of simple sequential
    code (though somewhat justified since pygal lacks native 2D histogram support)
  - The sys.path manipulation at the start is a workaround that adds complexity
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Annual Purchases count)
