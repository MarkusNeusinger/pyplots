review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic software module dependency network scenario
  - Clean hive plot structure with 3 radial axes at 120° separation
  - Good use of Bezier curves for edge visualization with appropriate alpha (0.5)
  - Colorblind-friendly color palette (blue/yellow/green)
  - Node sizes vary by degree, showing meaningful data encoding
  - Correct title format matching pyplots.ai specification
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (module names like main, data, config) are not visible in the rendered
    output - this is critical for identification
  - Significant whitespace at top and bottom of canvas - could improve canvas utilization
  - No legend explaining what node size represents (degree)
  - HTML output is generated but not required by spec
