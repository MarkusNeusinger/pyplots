review:
  strengths:
  - Creative isometric 3D projection technique that works excellently within Altair
    2D constraints
  - Depth-based opacity creates effective sense of 3D depth perception
  - Order encoding implements painter's algorithm for proper point layering
  - Interactive pan/zoom and comprehensive tooltips showing original 3D coordinates
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between clusters
  - Clean, well-documented code structure with clear separation of concerns
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels Projected X and Projected Z are generic; could reference the original
    3D axes more clearly
  - Uses deprecated selection_interval(bind=scales) API; should use chart.interactive()
    for simpler approach
