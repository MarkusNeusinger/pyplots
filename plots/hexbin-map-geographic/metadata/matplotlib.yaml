review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib native hexbin() function with reduce_C_function for
    aggregation
  - Borough annotations with white background boxes provide clear geographic context
  - Custom tick formatter displaying proper geographic coordinates (°W, °N)
  - Appropriate sequential colormap (YlOrRd) with well-labeled colorbar
  - Realistic NYC taxi data scenario demonstrates clear hexbin use case
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.4 is slightly prominent and competes visually with hexagon edges
  - Base map context is minimal (simple rectangle) - real geographic features would
    enhance the visualization
  - Could demonstrate additional aggregation methods (count, sum) mentioned in spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning map of NYC taxi pickup
    locations. The visualization uses a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red) sequential colormap
    where hexagons range from pale yellow (~$10 mean fare) to dark red (~$65 mean
    fare). Three borough labels (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens) are annotated with white
    background boxes. The x-axis shows longitude (74.05°W to 73.70°W) and y-axis shows
    latitude (40.60°N to 40.90°N). A vertical colorbar on the right displays "Mean
    Trip Fare ($)" with values ranging from approximately 10 to 65. The background
    has a light blue-gray color suggesting water, with a subtle land area rectangle.
    A context box in the lower-left provides metadata: "NYC Taxi Pickup Density, 5,000
    simulated points, Hexagonal binning with mean fare." The hexagons have thin gray
    edges and 85% opacity, allowing the grid lines (dashed, 40% alpha) to show through
    subtly.'
