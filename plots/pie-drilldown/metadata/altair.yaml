review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario with realistic company budget breakdown by department
    and team
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with mark_arc, selection parameters, and
    layered text labels
  - Breadcrumb navigation text clearly indicates hierarchy path
  - Clean color differentiation between hierarchy levels
  - Tooltips configured with formatted budget values and percentages
  - Instruction text helps users understand interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title is truncated showing Departments En... - needs wider legend or shorter
    title
  - Static side-by-side layout rather than true click-to-drilldown navigation as specified
  - Missing animated transitions when drilling down or up as required by spec
  - Only shows Engineering drilldown - other departments not explorable in static
    view
  - Selection parameter exists but does not drive actual drilldown behavior in static
    PNG output
