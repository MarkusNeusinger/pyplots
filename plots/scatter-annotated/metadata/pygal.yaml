review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of individual series per company to achieve distinct colors for
    each data point
  - Clean annotation placement with company names displayed directly on the chart
    using print_values and formatter
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent theming with appropriate font sizes
  - Well-chosen business context (tech companies market cap vs revenue) that is realistic
    and neutral
  - Proper canvas size (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is redundant with on-chart annotations and appears very small/hard
    to read
  - Some color pairs are similar (two purples, two greens) which could cause confusion
