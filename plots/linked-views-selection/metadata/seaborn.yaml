review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with consistent blue/gray selection encoding across all
    four views
  - Good use of seaborn kdeplot with fill for the density visualization
  - Clear selection indicator with dashed yellow line and informative subtitle showing
    selection count
  - Well-organized 2x2 grid layout with appropriate spacing
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib ax.hist() and ax.bar() instead of seaborn sns.histplot() and sns.barplot()
    for panels 2 and 3
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid of coordinated views demonstrating
    linked selection. The top-left panel shows a scatter plot with gray (unselected)
    and Python blue (#306998) points, separated by a yellow dashed vertical line at
    x=6.0 indicating the selection threshold. The top-right panel displays a histogram
    of "Value" with overlaid unselected (gray) and selected (blue) bars. The bottom-left
    panel shows a stacked bar chart breaking down each category (Group A, B, C) by
    selection status. The bottom-right panel shows KDE density distributions of Y
    values for selected and unselected points with filled areas. The main title "linked-views-selection
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at top with a subtitle showing "Selection: 95/150
    points where x > 6.0". All panels use consistent blue/gray color encoding.'
