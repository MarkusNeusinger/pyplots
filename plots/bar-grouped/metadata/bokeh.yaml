review:
  strengths:
  - Clean grouped bar implementation using Bokeh FactorRange and factor_cmap
  - Value labels on each bar enhance readability and data interpretation
  - Good use of group_padding for visual separation between quarters
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful data variation across quarters
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas size with appropriately scaled text
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color swatches all show the same blue color instead of the actual bar colors
  - No np.random.seed(42) even though data is deterministic
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    (Q1-Q4) for three product lines: Electronics (blue), Clothing (yellow), and Home
    & Garden (green). Each quarter has three side-by-side bars representing the different
    product categories. Value labels appear above each bar (e.g., "$245K", "$180K").
    The title reads "Quarterly Revenue by Product · bar-grouped · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The y-axis is labeled "Revenue ($ Thousands)" with tick marks at 0,
    100, 200, 300, 400. The x-axis shows "Quarter" with Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 labels. A legend
    in the top-right corner identifies the three product categories. The background
    is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: Uses FactorRange for grouped categorical axis and factor_cmap for
          coloring, but could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool
  verdict: APPROVED
