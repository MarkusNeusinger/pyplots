review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of manual Gaussian smoothing for density estimation without
    external dependencies
  - Proper Web Mercator coordinate transformation for tile compatibility
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.65) to allow basemap to show through
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Large gray area on left side where basemap tiles don't cover the ocean creates
    visual imbalance
  - Scatter points are too small and transparent (size=8, alpha=0.35) to be clearly
    visible
  - Does not use ColumnDataSource pattern as recommended in Bokeh library guidelines
  - Colorbar title is rotated and harder to read
  - The purple/magenta background color at low density values is visually unusual
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic heatmap of California showing
    air quality monitoring station density. Three distinct density clusters are visible:
    Northern California (around Sacramento/Bay Area), Central California coast (Monterey
    region), and Southern California (Los Angeles area). The heatmap uses a YlOrRd
    (Yellow-Orange-Red) sequential colormap, with bright yellow/white cores indicating
    high-density areas fading to orange and red at the periphery. A CartoDB Positron
    basemap is partially visible on the right side showing state boundaries and city
    labels. The left side shows a gray area over the Pacific Ocean where no tile data
    exists. Blue scatter points (size=8, alpha=0.35) mark individual sensor locations
    within the heatmap regions. The title "heatmap-geographic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top left. A legend for "Sensor Locations" is positioned in the top
    right corner. A vertical colorbar labeled "Air Quality Index (weighted density)"
    appears on the right edge with scale from 0 to ~35. Axis labels show "Longitude"
    (x-axis) and "Latitude" (y-axis) with Mercator projection tick values.'
