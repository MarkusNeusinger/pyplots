  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all font sizes explicitly set well above minimums for
    4800x2700 canvas
  - 'Clean visual refinement: L-shaped frame, removed spines/ticks, subtle grid lines
    at alpha=0.2'
  - 'Strong Bokeh idioms: ColumnDataSource, LabelSet, NumeralTickFormatter, dual PNG+HTML
    export'
  - Well-formatted value labels ($38.2K) that aid quick reading
  - Deterministic, realistic business data with good variation across categories
  - Perfect spec compliance — all specification notes addressed
  weaknesses:
  - No storytelling annotations (e.g., callout for highest/lowest department) — data
    is displayed clearly but not interpreted
  - Slight canvas imbalance with some wasted space on the right side
  - Could benefit from a more distinctive color scheme or subtle gradient to elevate
    beyond well-configured default
  image_description: 'The plot shows a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" displaying quarterly revenue by department. Six blue bars (#306998
    Python Blue) represent departments: Engineering ($38.2K), Marketing ($21.5K),
    Sales ($45.8K), Support ($14.3K), Design ($27.6K), and Operations ($19.1K). Each
    bar has a formatted dollar value label positioned above it in dark gray text.
    The y-axis shows "Revenue ($)" with dollar-formatted ticks from $0 to $50,000.
    The x-axis shows "Department" with category labels beneath each bar. The chart
    uses a clean L-shaped frame with top and right spines removed, subtle horizontal
    grid lines at low opacity, white bar edge lines for definition, and a white background.
    The layout fills the 4800×2700 canvas well with balanced proportions.'
