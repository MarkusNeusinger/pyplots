review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step function implementation using manual coordinate construction
  - Clean visual design with filled area under curve adding depth
  - Yellow markers at bin edges provide clear visual anchors for data points
  - Realistic web service response time scenario demonstrates practical application
  - Text sizing well-calibrated for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for all data
  weaknesses:
  - Bokeh toolbar/logo visible in top-right corner should be hidden for cleaner export
  - Could leverage HoverTool to show percentile information on hover
  - No reference lines showing common percentiles (p50, p90, p99) which would enhance
    the cumulative histogram utility
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram showing web service
    response times. The visualization features a blue step function line (#306998)
    with a light blue filled area underneath. Yellow circular markers (#FFD43B) with
    blue borders are placed at each bin edge to mark cumulative count values. The
    x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to approximately 700ms, and the
    y-axis shows "Cumulative Count" ranging from 0 to 500. The title correctly follows
    the format "histogram-cumulative · bokeh · pyplots.ai". The background is a light
    gray (#fafafa) with dashed grid lines at 0.3 alpha. The curve is monotonically
    increasing as expected for a cumulative histogram, starting at 0 and reaching
    500 (total sample size). There's a Bokeh logo/toolbar visible in the top-right
    corner.

  verdict: APPROVED
