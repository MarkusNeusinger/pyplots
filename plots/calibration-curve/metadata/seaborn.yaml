review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curves comparing three different classifiers
    with distinct calibration behaviors
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot and histplot functions with the whitegrid theme
  - 'Includes all spec requirements: diagonal reference line, 10 bins, Brier scores,
    histogram subplot, and multi-model comparison'
  - Good color choices with Python Blue and Yellow plus a distinguishable brown
  - Well-sized markers and line widths make the curves easy to follow
  - Title follows the exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram legend in the right panel overlaps slightly with the histogram bars
    at the top
  - The brown color for underconfident model could be more distinct from the yellow
    overconfident model
  - Could use seaborn built-in statistical features more extensively such as confidence
    bands
