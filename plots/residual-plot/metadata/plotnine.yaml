review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: zero reference line, ±2σ bands,
    LOWESS smoothing, and outlier coloring'
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics approach with proper layering of geoms
  - Good visual hierarchy with distinct colors for normal points (blue) vs outliers
    (red/coral)
  - Appropriate sizing and alpha for 150 data points
  - Manual OLS calculation demonstrates understanding without external dependencies
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use more descriptive context like "Fitted
    Response" or add domain context)
  - Data is somewhat generic - could use a more realistic scenario with meaningful
    variable names instead of abstract X/y_true
