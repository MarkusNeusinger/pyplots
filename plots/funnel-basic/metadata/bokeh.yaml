review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh patch() method to create custom trapezoidal funnel segments
  - Clear, well-sized text labels with smart color contrast (dark text on yellow background)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Proper implementation of width proportional to values relative to first stage
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with good comments
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Could improve canvas utilization by making funnel slightly larger to reduce
    bottom whitespace'
  - 'Minor: Color palette includes red-green combination (though not as sole differentiator)'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a funnel chart with 5 trapezoidal segments
    representing a sales funnel from top to bottom: Awareness (blue #306998, 1,000
    - 100%), Interest (yellow #FFD43B, 600 - 60%), Consideration (red #E74C3C, 400
    - 40%), Intent (purple #9B59B6, 200 - 20%), and Purchase (green #27AE60, 100 -
    10%). Each segment contains centered white text (dark text on yellow) with the
    stage name in bold and the value with percentage below. The funnel progressively
    narrows from top to bottom. A legend on the right side lists all stages with their
    values. The title "funnel-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    Axes and grid are hidden for a clean presentation.'
