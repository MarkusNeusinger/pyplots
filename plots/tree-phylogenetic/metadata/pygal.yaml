review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to represent phylogenetic tree structure
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color palette for species markers
  - Includes proper scale bar with units for evolutionary distance interpretation
  - Species labels are clearly positioned next to their markers without overlap
  - Scientifically accurate primate evolutionary relationships represented
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function which deviates from KISS principle
  - Tree is somewhat compressed with unused whitespace on the right side of the canvas
  - Y-axis grid lines are visible but serve no purpose for tree visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phylogenetic tree diagram showing primate
    evolutionary relationships. The tree has a white background with blue (pyplots
    blue #306998) branch lines connecting 6 species: Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutan,
    Gibbon, and Macaque. Each species is represented by a colored dot marker at the
    leaf node with matching colored bold text labels positioned to the right of each
    marker. The colors used are red (Human), blue (Chimpanzee), teal (Gorilla), gold
    (Orangutan), orange (Gibbon), and brown (Macaque) - a colorblind-friendly palette.
    The x-axis shows "Evolutionary Distance (substitutions per site)" from 0 to 1,
    with a scale bar in the bottom-left indicating "0.1 substitutions/site". The title
    reads "Primate Evolution · tree-phylogenetic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top.
    The tree correctly shows evolutionary relationships with Human-Chimpanzee as the
    closest pair, then Gorilla, then Orangutan, with Gibbon-Macaque as an outgroup.'

          Markers are well-sized (dots_size=28). Minor: some leaf nodes extend quite

          and somewhat distracting from the tree structure.
