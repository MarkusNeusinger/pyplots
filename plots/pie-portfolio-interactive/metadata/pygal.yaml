review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately sized fonts for the large canvas
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, orange)
  - Good use of pygal distinctive features including custom Style, donut inner_radius,
    and value formatting
  - Realistic portfolio allocation data with proper asset class categorization
  - Legend well-organized in a single row at bottom
  weaknesses:
  - PNG output cannot demonstrate the interactive drill-down features mentioned in
    the spec (inherent limitation)
  - Could show sub-holdings detail within the visualization to better represent the
    hierarchical data structure
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart (pie chart with inner radius)
    showing portfolio allocation across three asset classes. The chart uses a clean
    white background with three distinctly colored segments: blue for Equities (55%),
    yellow for Fixed Income (28%), and orange for Alternatives (17%). Percentage values
    are displayed directly on each slice in dark text. The title "pie-portfolio-interactive
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend at the bottom shows
    all three categories with their percentages in a single horizontal row. The donut
    chart is well-sized and centered, utilizing good canvas space.'
