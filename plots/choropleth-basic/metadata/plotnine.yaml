review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent handling of missing data with gray fill for Czechia as specified
  - Creative label offset solution prevents text overlap in crowded central Europe
  - Realistic population density values for European countries
  - Clean separation of data with values vs missing data using two geom_polygon layers
  - Good use of sequential Blues colormap which is colorblind-safe
  - Proper centroid calculation with manual adjustments for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Country shapes are highly stylized polygons rather than realistic geographic shapes
  - Legend colorbar could benefit from more tick marks for finer granularity
  - Some white space at image corners could be better utilized
