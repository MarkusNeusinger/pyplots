review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following KISS principle with clear data flow
  - Good use of pygal custom Style class for consistent theming at 4800x2700
  - Appropriate differentiation between raw data (thin line) and rolling average (thick
    line)
  - Correct handling of rolling average None values for first 6 days
  - X-axis label management showing only bi-weekly dates to avoid clutter
  - Python-branded colors (blue/yellow) provide good visual distinction
  - Realistic temperature scenario with clear warming trend
  weaknesses:
  - Legend items are spread far apart at the bottom (Raw Temperature on left, 7-Day
    Rolling Average on right), making them hard to associate as a unified legend
  - Yellow rolling average line could be slightly harder to see against white background
    for some users
