review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements 3D wireframe using Highcharts scatter3d with line connections
  - Two-color scheme (Python blue and darker blue) effectively distinguishes X and
    Y direction lines
  - Mathematical ripple function z = sin(√(x² + y²)) clearly demonstrates the 3D surface
    topology
  - 3D perspective with frame provides good depth perception
  - Title format follows required convention exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - plot occupies ~40-45% with empty space
    on right side
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library as specified in library rules
  - Z-axis label and tick marks not prominently visible in the current viewing angle
  - Wireframe lines become somewhat dense near the center of the ripple pattern
