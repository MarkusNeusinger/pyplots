review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot syntax
  - Realistic salary distribution scenario with meaningful department differences
  - 'Proper display of all boxplot components: median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers'
  - Good text sizing with element_text customizations for readability
  - Clean KISS code structure following library conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Default color palette could be improved with scale_fill_brewer for better colorblind
    accessibility
  - No subtle grid lines to aid value reading (theme_minimal removes them by default)
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace since no salaries are near
    zero
