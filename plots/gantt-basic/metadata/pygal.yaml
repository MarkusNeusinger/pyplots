review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear horizontal bars and proper spacing between
    tasks
  - Creative solution using SVG injection to implement Gantt chart in pygal (which
    lacks native Gantt support)
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent theming and proper font sizing at 4800x2700
  - Realistic software development project data with logical task sequences and overlaps
  - Clean color-coded categories with legend for easy interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color boxes are relatively small compared to the large canvas size
  - Missing current date vertical line marker mentioned in spec notes as a consideration
  - Red and green colors used together could be improved for colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart titled "Software Development
    Timeline · gantt-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" showing 12 software development tasks.
    Tasks are displayed as horizontal bars on a white background with task names on
    the left y-axis (Requirements Analysis at bottom, Deployment at top). The x-axis
    shows a timeline from January to April 2025 with month markers (Feb 1, Mar 1,
    Apr 1) indicated by vertical dashed gray lines. Tasks are color-coded by category:
    Planning (blue - #306998), Design (yellow - #FFD43B), Development (green - #2E8B57),
    Testing (red/crimson - #DC143C), and Deployment (purple - #9370DB). A legend at
    the bottom shows all five categories. The bars have rounded corners and show task
    overlaps clearly (e.g., System Design overlaps with Requirements Analysis). Text
    is legible with monospace font styling.'

        comment: Creative use of pygal HorizontalBar with custom SVG injection, custom

          native Gantt support would be preferred if available.
