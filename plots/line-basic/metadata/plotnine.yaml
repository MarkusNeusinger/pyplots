review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layered syntax (ggplot
    + geoms + theme)
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that perfectly demonstrates line plot trend
    visualization capability
  - Well-sized visual elements (line width 2.5, point size 6) appropriate for the
    data density
  - Proper font sizing following library guidelines (24pt title, 20pt axis, 16pt ticks)
  - Clean, minimal aesthetic with subtle grid that does not distract from the data
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows decimal tick values (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5) instead of integer
    months (1-12); should use scale_x_continuous with breaks=range(1,13) for cleaner
    month representation
  image_description: The plot displays a basic line chart showing monthly temperature
    data over a 12-month period. The line is rendered in a blue color (#306998) connecting
    12 data points, each marked with circular markers of the same blue color. The
    X-axis shows "Month" with decimal tick labels (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5), and
    the Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately 5 to 27 degrees.
    The title "line-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The plot
    uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines and a clean white background.
    The data follows a realistic seasonal temperature pattern - low in winter months
    (1-2, 11-12), rising through spring, peaking in summer (month 7), and declining
    through autumn.

        passed: false
        comment: Y-axis has units "Temperature (°C)" but X-axis "Month" could benefit
          from showing month names or clearer integer ticks instead of decimals (2.5,
          5.0, etc.)

        name: Grid & Legend
        score: 1

        passed: false
        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.3), but the X-axis decimal ticks (2.5, 5.0,
          7.5) are awkward for monthly data - should show integers 1-12
