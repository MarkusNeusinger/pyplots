review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of stepped interpolation (step-after) which correctly represents
    threshold-based PR curves
  - Clean comparison of two classifiers with clearly distinguishable colors (colorblind-safe)
  - Proper inclusion of random classifier baseline with dashed styling
  - Average Precision (AP) scores embedded directly in legend labels for easy reference
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate font sizes and symbol styling
  - Proper use of Altair layering for combining PR curves with baseline
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., "Recall (Sensitivity)" and "Precision
    (PPV)") to aid interpretation
