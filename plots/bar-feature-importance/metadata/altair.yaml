review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the specification with all required features (sorting,
    color gradient, error bars, text annotations)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper layered chart composition
  - Realistic customer analytics context with meaningful feature names
  - Good use of Altair's declarative encoding and color scales
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity at 0.3 could be reduced further (0.2) for subtler appearance
  - Unnecessary plot.html output alongside plot.png
