  strengths:
  - Excellent text scaling for 4800x2700 canvas with font sizes well above minimums
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, varea, HoverTool with
    vline mode, invisible scatter for hover targets'
  - Realistic data generation with trend + weekly seasonality + noise components
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Semi-transparent fill at alpha 0.4 provides good readability while maintaining
    visual weight
  - Y-axis properly starts at 0 to avoid misleading area representation
  - Dual export (PNG + HTML) leverages Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Data could show more dramatic variation or events (e.g., a traffic spike or dip)
    to better demonstrate the area chart ability to convey magnitude changes
  - Font sizes exceed the bokeh.md library guide recommendations (48pt vs 28pt title,
    36pt vs 22pt labels) — while readable, they are larger than the standard
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart titled "area-basic · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" showing daily website visitors over January 2024. The x-axis shows
    dates from Jan 01, 2024 to Feb 01, with major ticks at weekly intervals. The y-axis
    is labeled "Daily Visitors (count)" and ranges from 0 to approximately 7,000.
    The area below the line is filled with a semi-transparent blue (#306998, alpha
    0.4), and a solid blue line (line_width=5) traces the top edge of the filled area.
    The data exhibits a clear weekly cyclical pattern with an overall upward trend,
    starting around 5,000 visitors and ending near 7,000. Dashed grid lines are visible
    at low opacity (alpha 0.3). The layout is well-balanced with the plot filling
    a large portion of the 4800x2700 canvas. All text is clearly legible with appropriately
    scaled font sizes (title 48pt, axis labels 36pt, tick labels 28pt). The toolbar
    is removed for a clean static export.
