# scatter-basic-005: Regression Line Scatter Plot

## Description
A scatter plot showing data points with a fitted regression line and regression quality metrics.

## Requirements
1. Generate synthetic data suitable for linear regression
2. Create a scatter plot of data points
3. Add a fitted regression line
4. Display regression quality metrics (R², equation)
5. Include confidence interval or prediction band
6. Add grid for better readability
7. Use clear axis labels and title

## Data Generation
- Create synthetic data with linear relationship plus noise
- Use at least 50 data points
- Include some correlation between X and Y variables

## Visual Requirements
- Data points as scatter markers
- Regression line in contrasting color (e.g., red)
- Optional: Show confidence interval as shaded area
- Display R² value and regression equation on plot
- Professional appearance with grid

## Technical Requirements
- Calculate regression using appropriate methods
- Display statistical metrics clearly
- Handle edge cases (e.g., perfect correlation, no correlation)
- Return Figure object for further customization
