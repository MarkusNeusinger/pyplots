review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of custom ternary plot using Highcharts renderer API
    for triangle and grid
  - Well-chosen realistic context (soil composition) with proper Dirichlet-distributed
    data
  - Interactive tooltips showing actual sand/silt/clay percentages for each point
  - Clean visual design with appropriate grid transparency and marker sizing
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function ternary_to_cartesian violates KISS principle (should be inline
    calculation)
  - Legend is disabled when it could display the Soil Samples series name
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary diagram for soil composition with
    three components: Sand (top vertex), Silt (bottom-left), and Clay (bottom-right).
    An equilateral triangle contains ~50 blue circular markers with transparency (rgba
    blue #306998), representing soil samples. Grid lines at 20% intervals with percentage
    tick labels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) along each edge. The title "Soil Composition
    · ternary-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed. Clean white
    background with well-balanced margins.'
