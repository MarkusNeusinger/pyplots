review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Chernoff faces using plotnine grammar of graphics
    with geom_polygon, geom_path, and geom_point
  - Clear visual differentiation between car categories using face shape variations
    and color coding
  - Well-structured data with realistic car performance scenario that makes the facial
    feature mappings intuitive
  - Clean facet grid layout with informative strip labels for each observation
  - Effective use of theme_void and coord_fixed for proper face rendering
  - Color-blind friendly palette (blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions violate KISS principle; code should be linear without function
    definitions
  - The width/height parameters in plot.save() are redundant with figure_size in theme
