review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of opacity-based recency encoding that clearly shows
    data flow direction
  - Well-annotated with Latest and Oldest markers that visually communicate the streaming
    concept
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate font sizes for the target resolution
  - Realistic IoT sensor scenario with temperature and humidity measurements
  - Informative footer explaining the visualization encoding
  weaknesses:
  - The annotations for Latest and Oldest appear to point to nearby but different
    data points - Oldest annotation seems misplaced in the middle of data rather than
    at the truly oldest (most faded) point
  - Could benefit from a more prominent visual legend explaining the opacity scale
  - HTML export is included but adds no value for static image evaluation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with 200 data points representing
    temperature (°C) on the x-axis and humidity (%) on the y-axis. The points use
    a blue color scheme (#306998) with varying opacity to indicate data recency -
    older points appear more faded/transparent while newer points are solid. The data
    spans roughly 18-26°C in temperature and 40-72% humidity. Two annotations with
    arrows point to specific data points: "Latest" indicates the newest data point,
    and "Oldest" indicates the oldest. The title "scatter-streaming · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. A subtle footer note explains the opacity encoding: "200
    sensor readings | Point opacity indicates recency (older → faded, newer → solid)".
    The plot uses a clean white template with light gray grid lines and well-sized
    axis labels.'
