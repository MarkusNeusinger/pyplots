review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic server response patterns including daily/weekly
    cycles and anomaly spikes
  - Proper tooltip configuration using layer_tooltips for interactive hover information
  - Good color scheme with blue line and contrasting yellow points for accessibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Clean KISS code structure with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility could be reduced with explicit alpha setting (e.g., panel_grid
    alpha 0.3)
  - Output path uses script_dir which may cause issues - should save to current working
    directory as plot.png
  - Points (size=2) are slightly small for 350 data points - could be size=3 for better
    visibility in static PNG
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive time series line chart showing
    server response times over approximately 15 days (June 1-16, 2024). A blue line
    (#306998) connects 350 data points, with yellow/gold circular markers (#FFD43B)
    at each observation. The Y-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately
    55-155ms. The X-axis shows "Date/Time" with daily tick marks. The title correctly
    shows "line-interactive · lets-plot · pyplots.ai". The visualization clearly shows
    daily cyclical patterns (peaks during business hours, troughs at night) and several
    anomaly spikes around June 3, June 9-10, and June 13 that reach 125-155ms. The
    plot uses a clean minimal theme with a subtle grid, good canvas utilization, and
    balanced margins.

        comment: Uses layer_tooltips for hover, ggplot grammar, ggsave with scale
          parameter. Could leverage more lets-plot interactive features like coord_cartesian
          for zoom limits.
  verdict: APPROVED
