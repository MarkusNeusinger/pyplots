review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with clean, uncluttered design - removed grid lines for
    cleaner rug plot appearance
  - Perfect title format and informative subtitle with units
  - Great data story showing three response time clusters plus outliers - demonstrates
    the value of rug plots
  - 'Smart use of tight y-axis bounds (max: 1.2) to maximize vertical space utilization'
  - Appropriate transparency (0.6 alpha) to show overlapping tick marks
  - 'Colorblind-safe color choice (Python blue #306998)'
  weaknesses:
  - Rug tick marks extend nearly full height of plot area; traditional rug plots have
    much shorter ticks positioned at the axis edge
  - The tick line width (5px) is adequate but could be slightly bolder for better
    visibility of sparse outliers
