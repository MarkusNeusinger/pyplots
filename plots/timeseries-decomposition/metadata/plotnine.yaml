review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine facet_wrap for creating the four-panel decomposition
    layout
  - Clean implementation using statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper time series
    analysis
  - Good color choice (#306998) that is accessible and professional
  - Proper handling of NaN values from decomposition edges
  - Correct categorical ordering of components using pd.Categorical
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - 12 years of monthly data provides meaningful decomposition
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels in the Original panel appear slightly crowded with multiple
    values stacked
  - Panel spacing could be reduced to make better use of vertical canvas space
  - Grid alpha at 0.5 could be more subtle (0.3 would be better)
