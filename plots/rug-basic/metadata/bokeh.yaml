quality_score: 72
review:
  strengths:
  - Clear bimodal distribution effectively demonstrates clustering patterns and data
    gaps
  - Appropriate use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) for overlapping tick marks
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Y-axis correctly hidden for rug plot visualization
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and segment glyph
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Value is generic; could use a realistic context (e.g., Response Time
    (ms))
  - Large whitespace above the rug ticks wastes vertical canvas space
