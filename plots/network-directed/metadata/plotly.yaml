review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout algorithm that positions nodes evenly and prevents overlap
  - Clear arrow direction implementation using Plotly annotations with appropriate
    sizing
  - Well-chosen color scheme that distinguishes module groups effectively and is colorblind-accessible
  - Good use of Plotly hover template for interactive exploration
  - Title follows the exact spec-id format required
  - Realistic software dependency scenario that matches the spec example perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Some longer node labels (middleware, validators, schemas) appear slightly cramped
    within their circular markers
  - The graph does not include bidirectional edges to demonstrate curved edge handling
    mentioned in spec notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a directed network graph showing software
    module dependencies. 13 nodes are arranged in a circular layout, each containing
    a module name (main, api, auth, database, models, utils, config, logging, cache,
    router, middleware, validators, schemas). Nodes are color-coded by group: Python
    Blue (#306998) for Entry (main), Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for Core modules (api,
    auth, database, cache, router, middleware), Teal (#4ECDC4) for Data modules (models,
    validators, schemas), and Gray (#95A5A6) for Helpers (utils, config, logging).
    Directed edges connect nodes with gray lines and visible arrowheads pointing toward
    the target node. The title reads "Software Module Dependencies · network-directed
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend titled "Module Groups" appears on
    the right side listing Entry, Core, Data, and Helpers with their respective colors.'
