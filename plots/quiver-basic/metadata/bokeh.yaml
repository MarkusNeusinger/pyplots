review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of quiver plot using Bokeh segment and patches primitives
    since Bokeh lacks a native quiver function
  - Clean circular rotation pattern (u=-y, v=x) demonstrates vector field concept
    effectively
  - Proper arrowhead geometry calculation with perpendicular vectors
  - Good arrow spacing on 15x15 grid prevents overlap
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labels
  - Well-structured KISS code following project guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Arrows are normalized to uniform length, losing magnitude information (spec says
    length proportional to magnitude)
  - Grid lines almost invisible due to alpha and dashes combination
  - Axis labels lack units
