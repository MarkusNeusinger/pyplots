review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of bimodal height data showing male/female distributions - demonstrates
    histogram capabilities well
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  - Good visual balance with appropriate bin count (30 bins for 600 data points)
  - White bar borders create clear bin separation as specified
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines despite theme_minimal() - could add subtle grid for easier
    frequency reading
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like interactive tooltips or
    custom scales
