review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visual appearance with appropriate font sizes
  - Good acknowledgment of seaborn limitations for interactive features
  - Realistic sales data scenario with appropriate value ranges
  - Annotations simulating hover data show dollar amounts and percentages
  - Proper use of seaborn modern API (hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings)
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn fundamentally cannot implement the core spec requirement for interactive
    hover and click features
  - Alternating blue-yellow color scheme serves no data purpose and could confuse
    viewers
  - Disclaimer note box detracts from the visualization
  - No meaningful use of seaborn distinctive statistical features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart showing sales revenue by product
    category. There are 6 bars representing Electronics ($4,850, 29.9%), Clothing
    ($3,200, 19.8%), Home & Garden ($2,750, 17.0%), Sports ($2,100, 13.0%), Books
    ($1,850, 11.4%), and Toys ($1,450, 9.0%). The bars alternate between two colors:
    a steel blue (#306998) and a golden yellow (#FFD43B). Each bar has value and percentage
    annotations positioned above it in bold dark text. The title reads "bar-interactive
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". An informational box in the upper right corner states
    "Static visualization (seaborn) - For interactivity, use: plotly, bokeh, altair".
    The y-axis is labeled "Sales Revenue ($)" and the x-axis is labeled "Product Category".
    A subtle dashed gray grid is visible on the y-axis. The top and right spines are
    removed for a cleaner appearance.'
