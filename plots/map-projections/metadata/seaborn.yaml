review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent educational demonstration of projection distortion using Tissot indicatrices
  - Clean 2x2 comparison layout allows easy side-by-side projection comparison
  - Good color scheme with colorblind-safe colors for land, ocean, and distortion
    indicators
  - Correct mathematical implementations of all four projections (Mercator, Mollweide,
    Robinson, Sinusoidal)
  - Explanatory subtitle helps users understand the Tissot indicatrices
  weaknesses:
  - Latitude/longitude labels are only shown for Mercator; other projections lack
    coordinate references
  - Graticule lines are very faint (alpha=0.7, linewidth=0.5) and could be more visible
  - Continent outlines are highly simplified polygons rather than realistic coastlines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid comparing four different map projections:
    Mercator (top-left), Mollweide (top-right), Robinson (bottom-left), and Sinusoidal
    (bottom-right). Each subplot shows simplified continental outlines in a muted
    green color (#c8d8c8) with blue edges (#306998) on a light blue ocean background
    (#d4e8f7). Gray graticule lines (latitude and longitude) are visible at 30-degree
    intervals. Yellow ellipses (Tissot indicatrices) with gold borders demonstrate
    projection distortion patterns at various locations across the globe. The main
    title "map-projections · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, and
    an explanatory subtitle at the bottom describes the Tissot indicatrices. Each
    subplot has its projection name as a title. The Mercator projection shows latitude
    labels on the left and longitude labels at the bottom.'
