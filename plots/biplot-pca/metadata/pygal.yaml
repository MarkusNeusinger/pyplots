review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Iris dataset providing realistic, interpretable context
  - 'Correct variance explained percentages on axis labels (PC1: 73.0%, PC2: 22.9%)'
  - Colorblind-friendly palette distinguishes species and loading vectors effectively
  - Unit circle provides appropriate reference for loading magnitudes
  - Good canvas utilization and overall layout
  weaknesses:
  - Loading vectors rendered as thick filled shapes that obscure underlying data points
    - should be thin line arrows
  - Legend labels are truncated (Sepal L., Petal W.) despite full names defined in
    code
  - Arrow rendering creates visual clutter near the origin where all four vectors
    originate
  - No explicit random seed (though dataset is deterministic)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot of the Iris dataset on a 4800x2700
    white canvas. Three species are shown as scatter points: Setosa (blue, clustered
    on the left), Versicolor (yellow, in the middle), and Virginica (green, on the
    right). A dashed red/pink unit circle is centered at the origin for loading magnitude
    reference. Four loading vectors are rendered as large filled arrow shapes originating
    from the origin: Sepal Width (purple, pointing upward), Sepal Length (brown/red,
    pointing upper-right), Petal Length (orange, pointing right), and Petal Width
    (teal, pointing right). The axis labels correctly show "PC1 (73.0%)" and "PC2
    (22.9%)". The title "biplot-pca · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend
    appears in the top-left corner showing all series with abbreviated labels.'
