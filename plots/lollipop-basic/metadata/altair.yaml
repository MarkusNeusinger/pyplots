review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of lollipop chart using Altair layered approach (mark_rule
    for stems + mark_circle for dots)
  - Proper sorting by value for optimal readability
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes (title 28pt, labels 16-20pt)
  - Rotated x-axis labels (-45°) prevent overlap with 10 categories
  - Tooltips with currency formatting enhance usability
  - Realistic product sales data scenario
  - Subtle grid styling (opacity 0.3) does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear only on y-axis; adding subtle vertical grid lines could improve
    category-value alignment reading
  - Layout could utilize more canvas space (plot area is somewhat compact relative
    to total canvas)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a lollipop chart showing "Product Sales by
    Category" with 10 categories on the x-axis and sales values in dollars on the
    y-axis. Each category has a vertical blue stem (line) extending from 0 to its
    value, topped with a blue circular dot. Categories are sorted in descending order
    from left to right: Electronics ($425,000), Clothing ($312,000), Home & Garden
    ($287,000), Sports ($234,000), Books ($198,000), Toys ($176,000), Beauty ($152,000),
    Automotive ($134,000), Food & Grocery ($118,000), and Pet Supplies ($95,000).
    The color used is a consistent blue (#306998) for both stems and dots. X-axis
    labels are rotated -45 degrees to prevent overlap. The title "lollipop-basic ·
    altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A subtle grid is visible on the
    y-axis.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative layering with mark_rule + mark_circle,
          proper encoding types (:N, :Q), and tooltips with formatting. Could have
          added interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
