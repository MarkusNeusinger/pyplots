review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative selection and binding system for the slider
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal sales patterns
  - Good visual design with appropriate font sizes and color choice
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis scale starts at 0 but data ranges from 140-190 creating unused space at
    bottom
  - Current slider value not prominently displayed near the slider as spec suggests
