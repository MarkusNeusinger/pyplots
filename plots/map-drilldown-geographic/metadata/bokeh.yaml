review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (TapTool, CustomJS callbacks, HoverTool)
  - Well-structured hierarchical data with three levels (country → state → city)
  - Clean breadcrumb navigation implementation
  - Appropriate color scheme with Blues9 sequential palette
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Simplified rectangular polygons instead of actual geographic boundaries reduce
    visual appeal
  - Color bar legend appears partially cut off on the right edge
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the key feature (drill-down interactivity)
  - Values are not displayed on regions in static view (only via tooltips in interactive
    mode)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a choropleth-style map of the Americas showing 5 countries (Canada, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina) as simplified rectangular polygons. Each country is filled with a shade of blue from the Blues9 palette, with darker blue indicating higher sales values. Canada and the United States appear in darker blue shades (higher values: $850M US, $320M Canada), while Argentina appears lightest (lowest value: $95M). Mexico shows medium-light blue ($180M), and Brazil shows medium blue ($420M).

    The title "map-drilldown-geographic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A breadcrumb navigation "📍 World" appears in the top-left corner on a light gray background. Axes show "Longitude" (x-axis) and "Latitude" (y-axis) with appropriate coordinate ranges. A color bar legend labeled "Sales ($M)" appears on the right side showing the value scale from 0 to 800. An instruction text at the bottom reads "Click on a region to drill down into its subdivisions. Currently showing: Countries → States (US) → Cities (California)". Country name labels are centered within each rectangular region.
