review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of overfitting visualization with validation loss diverging
    after epoch 60
  - Clean, readable code with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of Plotly hover templates showing epoch and loss values on hover
  - Appropriate color scheme (blue/yellow) with good accessibility
  - Best epoch marker with star symbol effectively highlights the optimal stopping
    point
  - HTML output enabled for full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend background slightly blends with grid lines in upper right area
  - Star marker for best epoch could be larger (size 16 is adequate but not prominent)
  - Could utilize Plotly-specific features like vertical line annotation at best epoch
    or shaded overfitting region
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth line curves over a white background
    with subtle gray gridlines. The title "line-loss-training · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The blue line (Training Loss) and yellow/gold line (Validation
    Loss) both start around 2.5 and decrease exponentially. The training loss continues
    decreasing to approximately 0.2, while the validation loss reaches a minimum around
    epoch 60 (marked with a red star labeled "Best: Epoch 61") and then diverges upward,
    demonstrating classic overfitting behavior. The x-axis shows "Epoch" (0-100),
    and the y-axis shows "Cross-Entropy Loss" (0.5-2.5+). A legend in the upper right
    corner identifies the three elements: Training Loss, Validation Loss, and Best
    Epoch.'
