review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step-after interpolation creating proper stair-step
    pattern
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate font sizes and good canvas utilization
  - Markers at data points clearly highlight where changes occur (as recommended in
    spec)
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that demonstrates practical step chart usage
  - Proper use of Altair declarative encoding with N (nominal) and Q (quantitative)
    types
  weaknesses:
  - Could add tooltips for enhanced interactivity since Altair excels at this
  - Grid styling could be slightly more refined (gridDash appears somewhat prominent)
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart showing monthly cumulative sales
    data from January to December. The chart uses a blue color (#306998) for both
    the stepped line and filled circular markers at each data point. The step pattern
    uses "step-after" interpolation, creating the characteristic stair-step appearance
    where values remain constant until the next data point. The X-axis shows abbreviated
    month names (Jan-Dec) with horizontal labels, while the Y-axis displays "Cumulative
    Sales (thousands $)" ranging from 0 to approximately 180. The title "step-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clear, readable font. Subtle dashed
    grid lines aid in reading values. The overall layout shows good canvas utilization
    with balanced margins.
