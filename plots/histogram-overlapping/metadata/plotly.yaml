review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of overlay barmode for true overlapping histograms with proper transparency
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow) with good contrast
  - Realistic height data scenario that clearly demonstrates distribution overlap
  - Proper font sizing scaled for 4800x2700 output
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML export (leveraging plotly strengths)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses: []
