review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic market share data with meaningful segment names
  - Clean implementation using Altair layering approach to overlay exploded arcs
  - Good color palette starting with Python blue (#306998) and colorblind-safe colors
  - Proper title format following specification requirements
  - Legend is well-positioned and clearly readable
  - Percentage labels are bold white and visible on all slice colors
  weaknesses:
  - The explosion effect is implemented as radius variation rather than true positional
    offset - slices should physically separate from the center
  - Significant empty space in the lower portion of the canvas could be better utilized
  - The chart only occupies about 60% of the vertical space despite using 1200x1200
    canvas
