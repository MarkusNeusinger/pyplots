review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent application of radar chart for employee performance comparison - a textbook
    use case
  - 'Perfect implementation of all spec requirements: filled polygons with alpha 0.25,
    gridlines at intervals of 20, axis labels at outer edge, distinct colors with
    legend, polygon closure'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle with deterministic data
  - Well-balanced square layout appropriate for radar charts
  - Colorblind-safe Python-themed color scheme (blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels for radar charts do not have units, which is expected but costs 2
    points in VQ-06
  - Could show more variation in data (e.g., one very low or very high score) to better
    demonstrate radar chart capabilities
  - Basic matplotlib polar features used; advanced features like custom tick formatters
    or spine styling not utilized
