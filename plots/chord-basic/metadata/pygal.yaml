review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using XY chart with Bezier curves to simulate chord diagram
    functionality
  - Excellent color palette that is colorblind-accessible with distinct hues for each
    continent
  - Realistic migration data scenario that perfectly demonstrates bidirectional flow
    relationships
  - Proper use of stroke width variation to indicate flow magnitude
  - Clean white background and good overall aesthetic
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays many small colored squares (one per unlabeled chord series) instead
    of just the 6 continent colors, making it confusing
  - The bezier_curve function violates the KISS principle (no functions/classes rule)
  - Not a true chord diagram - appears more like a network/arc diagram without the
    characteristic arc segments on the perimeter
  - Title contains redundant Continental Migration text before the required spec-id
    format
