review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of nested confidence bands using AreaRangeSeries with
    proper z-ordering
  - Clear visual distinction between historical (solid blue) and forecast (dashed
    orange) data
  - Professional use of plotLines to mark forecast start with label
  - High-resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriate font scaling
  - Good use of shared tooltip for interactive viewing
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence bands use similar yellow tones - slightly more color differentiation
    would improve clarity
  - Legend symbols at bottom are small relative to the large canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series forecast with uncertainty bands.
    The chart shows historical product demand data (Jan 2022 - Dec 2024) as a solid
    blue line with circular markers, followed by forecast data (Jan 2025 - Nov 2025)
    as a dashed orange line with diamond markers. Two nested confidence bands are
    shown: a lighter pale yellow/cream band for 95% CI and a darker golden yellow
    band for 80% CI, both widening over time to represent increasing uncertainty.
    A vertical dashed gray line labeled "Forecast Start" clearly delineates the historical
    from forecast periods. The title follows the required format "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a descriptive subtitle. Axes are properly labeled
    ("Date" for X, "Product Demand (Units)" for Y), and a clear legend at the bottom
    identifies all four series.'

          plotLines for forecast marker - good usage but not exceptional
