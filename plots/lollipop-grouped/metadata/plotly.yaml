review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized markers (22px) and stems (width 4)
  - Clean implementation using go.Scatter for both stems and markers
  - Good use of hovertemplate for informative tooltips
  - Proper grouping offset calculation for side-by-side positioning
  - White edge on markers provides good visual separation
  - Appropriate business context (quarterly revenue by region and product line)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows line+marker instead of just marker dots (minor visual inconsistency)
  - Color palette functional but not from a standard colorblind-safe palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue (in millions of dollars) across 5 regions (North America, Europe, Asia
    Pacific, Latin America, Middle East) for 3 product lines (Electronics, Apparel,
    Home Goods). Each lollipop consists of a vertical stem extending from the baseline
    (0) to a circular marker at the data value. The three series are positioned side-by-side
    within each category group. Colors used are: blue (#306998) for Electronics, yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Apparel, and brown (#8B4513) for Home Goods. The title "lollipop-grouped
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A horizontal legend below the title
    identifies the three series. The y-axis shows "Quarterly Revenue (Million $)"
    ranging from 0 to ~55, and the x-axis shows "Region" with all 5 category labels
    clearly visible. The plot uses a clean white template with subtle gridlines.'
