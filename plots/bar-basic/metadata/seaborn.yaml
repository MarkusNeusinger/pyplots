review:
  strengths:
  - Effective data storytelling with annotations highlighting top and bottom performers,
    plus descending sort order creating a natural ranking narrative
  - Strong color hierarchy using Python Blue palette with three emphasis levels that
    guide the reader's eye
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed spines, subtle grid, explicit font sizing, well-balanced
    margins'
  - Good use of seaborn's hue-based palette mapping for emphasis coloring with dodge=False
  weaknesses:
  - 'Code elegance could improve: the emphasis column + hue mapping pattern is slightly
    over-engineered for highlighting 2 bars; a direct color list would be simpler'
  - Upper-right canvas area has excess whitespace due to the Lowest annotation arrow
    trajectory spanning a large area
  - Bar label font size (18pt bold) is slightly large relative to axis labels (20pt),
    creating a minor hierarchy issue
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product sales
    across 8 categories, sorted in descending order. The top performer (Electronics,
    218 units) uses a dark Python Blue (#306998), while middle bars use a lighter
    blue (#7BAFD4), and the lowest performer (Books, 41 units) is rendered in a muted
    grey (#A3BFCF). Each bar has a bold value label above it. Two annotations with
    arrows highlight the top seller ("Top seller — 218 units") pointing to Electronics
    and the lowest seller ("Lowest — 41 units") pointing to Books. The title reads
    "bar-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in medium weight. Axis labels are "Product
    Category" (x) and "Sales (units)" (y). Top and right spines are removed, with
    a subtle y-axis grid (alpha=0.2). The layout is 16:9 landscape with balanced margins.

        comment: Uses sns.barplot with hue parameter, sns.set_context for scaling,
          axes-level API. Hue used for emphasis rather than data grouping is creative

        comment: Leverages seaborn hue-based palette mapping with dodge=False, sns.set_context
          for global scaling, bar_label via matplotlib container integration
