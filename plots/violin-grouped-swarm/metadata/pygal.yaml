review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative use of pygal XY chart to simulate violin plots with KDE calculation
  - Clean visual design with proper transparency allowing swarm points to show through
    violins
  - Realistic response time data with meaningful differences between groups and task
    complexity
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Good implementation of swarm layout algorithm to avoid point overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions deviate from KISS principle (though necessary for this complex
    visualization)
  - Legend entries are visually separated too far apart in the bottom layout
  - Swarm points use darker shades rather than exactly matching violin hue as spec
    suggests
  image_description: The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm overlay showing
    response times across three task types (Simple, Medium, Complex) and two expertise
    levels (Novice and Expert). Six violin shapes are rendered with semi-transparent
    fills - blue (#306998) for Novice and yellow (#FFD43B) for Expert. Each violin
    has darker-toned swarm points overlaid showing individual data values. The violins
    are properly grouped side-by-side within each task category. The title "violin-grouped-swarm
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging
    0-2000, X-axis shows "Task Type" with category labels. A legend at the bottom
    shows "Novice" and "Expert" entries. The plot uses a white background with subtle
    horizontal grid lines. The layout is well-proportioned with the chart taking appropriate
    canvas space.
