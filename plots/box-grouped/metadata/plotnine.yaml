review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layered construction
  - Well-designed data generation with realistic variation across departments and
    experience levels
  - Good use of position_dodge2 for clean grouped box arrangement
  - Appropriate outlier handling with clear visibility
  - Clean theme customization with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Categorical ordering ensures consistent experience level display order
  weaknesses:
  - The two blue colors (Junior and Senior) are somewhat similar; a more distinct
    palette would improve differentiation
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Performance Score (0-100))
