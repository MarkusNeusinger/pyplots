review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn JointGrid with marginal KDE distributions for hexbin
    — a sophisticated combination showcasing seaborn distinctive features
  - Realistic GPS coordinate data with three named clusters creates natural density
    patterns
  - LogNorm color scale properly handles wide density variation across clusters
  - All font sizes explicitly set, viridis colormap, spines removed, subtle grid —
    production-quality polish
  - Clean minimal code structure with appropriate complexity
  weaknesses:
  - Minor gap between title and top marginal creates unused white space
  - Marginal distribution panels retain grid lines which looks slightly less polished
    than the main axes
  - Colorbar positioning slightly crowds the right side of the layout
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning density map of simulated
    GPS coordinates using seaborn''s JointGrid. The main panel shows two distinct
    clusters of hexagonal bins colored with the viridis colormap (dark purple for
    low density, through teal/green to bright yellow for high density). The left cluster
    is elongated vertically centered around longitude -74.00, latitude 40.75, with
    a secondary density peak toward the north (shopping district merging with downtown).
    The right cluster is centered around longitude -73.88, latitude 40.78 (airport
    area). A vertical colorbar on the right shows "Point Count (log scale)" ranging
    from 10^0 to 10^2+. Top marginal panel shows a bimodal KDE distribution in blue
    (#306998) with fill, corresponding to the two longitude clusters. Right marginal
    panel shows a multimodal KDE distribution reflecting the latitude spread. Axis
    labels read "Longitude (°W)" and "Latitude (°N)". Title at top: "hexbin-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Top and right spines are removed on the main axes, grid
    is subtle dashed lines at alpha=0.2.'
