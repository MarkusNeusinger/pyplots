review:
  strengths:
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette using Python blue-based colors
  - Proper use of Altair repeat functionality for creating the matrix grid
  - Good data generation with realistic iris-like measurements for three species
  - Clear species separation visible in petal measurements showing natural clustering
  - Appropriate use of tooltips for interactivity
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing diagonal histograms or KDE plots as explicitly required by the specification
    - the diagonal currently shows scatter plots of variables against themselves instead
    of univariate distributions
  - Legend text is too small compared to the canvas size - should be larger for better
    readability
  - Could utilize Altair layering capabilities to show different marks on diagonal
    vs off-diagonal cells
