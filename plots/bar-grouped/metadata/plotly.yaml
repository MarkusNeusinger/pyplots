review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Value labels positioned outside bars make precise comparisons easy
  - Horizontal legend placement keeps the chart area uncluttered
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation across quarters and products
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotly idioms
  - Correctly generates both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is slightly too subtle - 0.2-0.3 would aid value reading
  - Does not leverage plotly-specific features like hover templates with custom formatting
