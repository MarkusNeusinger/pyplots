review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic context with simplified coastline polygons as basemap
  - Proper square-root scaling of bubble area (not radius) for accurate visual perception
  - Two well-designed separate legends for continent and population size
  - Clean color palette with six distinguishable continent colors
  - Good transparency (alpha=0.6) handling overlapping bubbles
  - Realistic dataset of 27 major world cities with accurate coordinates
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line alpha (0.3) could be slightly more subtle for cleaner appearance
  - Dense clustering of Asian cities makes individual comparison difficult
  - Does not use more advanced seaborn features beyond basic scatterplot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world bubble map showing major city populations
    across continents. The ocean is rendered in light blue (#d4e8f7), with simplified
    continent outlines filled in light gray (#e8e8e8) with subtle gray borders. Twenty-seven
    cities are represented as semi-transparent bubbles (alpha=0.6) with white edge
    borders. Bubble sizes range from small (Sydney ~5.4M) to very large (Tokyo ~37M),
    following square-root scaling for proper area perception. Colors distinguish continents:
    Asia (blue #306998), South America (green), North America (orange), Africa (purple),
    Europe (yellow), and Oceania (teal). Two well-placed legends appear: a continent
    color legend in the lower left and a size legend showing 5M, 15M, and 30M reference
    bubbles in the lower right. The title "World Major City Populations · bubble-map-geographic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is bold and properly formatted at the top. Axis labels
    show "Longitude (°)" and "Latitude (°)" with proper degree symbols. A subtle dashed
    grid (alpha=0.3) aids geographic orientation.'
