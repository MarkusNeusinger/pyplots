review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear, readable text at all sizes
  - Good use of seaborn barplot and whitegrid style for clean aesthetics
  - Realistic sales data with seasonal patterns that demonstrate the plot purpose
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability
  - Clear instructional text guides users on slider interaction
  - Proper integration of matplotlib Slider widget with seaborn styling
  weaknesses:
  - Missing slider update callback function - the slider is rendered but has no on_changed
    handler to actually update the plot when dragged, making the interactivity non-functional
  - Title format includes extra context (Monthly Sales for 2022) which deviates from
    the standard {spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai format
  - Year labels below slider positioned with fig.text could overlap or look disconnected
    from the slider track
