review:
  strengths:
  - Good Q-Q plot implementation with clear visualization of quantile comparison
  - Correctly uses dashed yellow reference line (y=x) that is clearly visible
  - Appropriate marker size (radius=18) and alpha (0.7) for 100 data points
  - Uses colorblind-safe Python blue and yellow color scheme
  - Correctly implements theoretical quantile scaling to sample scale
  - Data demonstrates slight right skew as intended, showing Q-Q interpretation capability
  - 'Title follows required format: qq-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Legend is informative with sample size (N=100) and reference line explanation
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (currently alpha 0.15, could use 0.1)
  - Axis labels could include units or more context (e.g., Theoretical Quantiles (Standard
    Deviations))
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot with a white
    background. Blue circular markers (Python blue color #306998 with 0.7 alpha) represent
    sample quantiles plotted against theoretical quantiles. A dashed yellow reference
    line (y=x) runs diagonally across the plot. The title "qq-basic · highcharts ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The x-axis is labeled "Theoretical Quantiles"
    and the y-axis "Sample Quantiles". Both axes range approximately from 6 to 102.
    A legend in the top-right corner identifies the reference line and sample quantiles
    (N=100). The data points follow the reference line closely in the middle range
    but show slight deviation at the upper end, indicating the intended right skew
    in the data.'
