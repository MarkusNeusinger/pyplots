review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of centered baseline algorithm creating true streamgraph
    appearance
  - Smooth spline curves create the flowing, organic look specified
  - Python Blue/Yellow color scheme with harmonious colorblind-safe palette
  - Proper use of Plotly fill=toself for creating the stacked areas
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good font sizing for all text elements at target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Streaming Hours (Millions) is slightly confusing when the centered
    baseline creates negative values
