review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of grouped lollipop chart using scatter series with custom
    stem rendering
  - Creative use of Highcharts render event to draw stems programmatically
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Proper grouping offset calculation for side-by-side positioning
  - Good data scenario with realistic business context
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels could be larger for better readability at the canvas size
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across four regions (North, South, East, West). Each category
    has three lollipops side by side representing Electronics (blue #306998), Furniture
    (yellow #FFD43B), and Clothing (purple #9467BD). The lollipops consist of thin
    vertical stems extending from the baseline (y=0) to circular markers at the data
    values. The title "lollipop-grouped · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold. The Y-axis shows "Revenue ($ Millions)" ranging from 0 to 5.4, with
    dashed gray grid lines. The X-axis shows region labels (North, South, East, West).
    A vertical legend on the right identifies each series with colored circle symbols.
    The chart uses a white background with good spacing between grouped lollipops.
    The stem width is appropriate and markers are clearly visible circular dots.'

          is good use of Highcharts extensibility.
