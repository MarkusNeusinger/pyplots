review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing throughout - all elements perfectly legible at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Well-chosen realistic business scenario (tech company market performance) with
    appropriate data ranges
  - Good use of Bokeh's ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for clean data binding
  - Proper styling with subtle grid, good color choice, and appropriate marker sizing
    for the data density
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Missing connecting lines/arrows from labels to points as specified in the notes
    section of the specification
  - Some label pairs are close together (ByteWorks/CyberLink, SoftPeak/NetFlow) -
    could benefit from collision avoidance
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's distinctive hover tooltip feature which would enhance
    the visualization
