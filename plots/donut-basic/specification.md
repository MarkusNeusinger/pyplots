# donut-basic: Basic Donut Chart

## Description

A donut chart (ring chart) showing proportions of categorical data as segments of a ring, with a hollow center. Similar to pie charts but the empty center can display summary statistics or additional information. The ring format can be easier to read when comparing segment sizes.

## Applications

## Data

- `category` (string) - category labels

- Size: 3-8 categories

## Notes

- Include percentage labels on segments
- Maintain consistent segment ordering
- Consider thick ring width for readability
