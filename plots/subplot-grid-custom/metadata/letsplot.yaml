review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of ggbunch for flexible subplot positioning with relative
    coordinates
  - Clean financial dashboard theme coherently applied across all subplots
  - Good variety of plot types (line+area, bar, histogram, categorical bar with gradient
    fill, annotated heatmap)
  - Proper use of scale_fill_gradient2 for diverging color scales on both sectors
    and correlation heatmap
  - Descriptive axis labels with units throughout
  - Appropriate text sizing scaled for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate a vertically-spanning subplot (rowspan equivalent) to fully
    showcase custom grid capabilities
  - The -0.15 value in correlation heatmap appears slightly clipped/cramped
  - Library features score limited - did not leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip
    capabilities in HTML output
