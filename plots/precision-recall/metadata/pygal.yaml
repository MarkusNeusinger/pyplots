review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stepped precision-recall curves showing threshold-based
    nature
  - Comprehensive comparison with two classifiers (Logistic Regression and Random
    Forest) showing different performance levels
  - Proper baseline reference line at positive class ratio (0.31) for random classifier
    comparison
  - Average Precision (AP) scores clearly displayed in legend for each model
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette using Python branding colors (blue, yellow) plus
    red for baseline
  - Good use of pygal-specific features including custom Style and stroke_dasharray
    for dashed baseline
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at top-left instead of bottom as configured (legend_at_bottom=True
    appears ineffective)
  - Minor visual density could be improved with slightly thicker stroke width for
    better curve distinction
  image_description: 'The plot displays a precision-recall curve visualization on
    a white background with the title "precision-recall · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the
    top. Two classifier curves are shown: a blue stepped line for "Logistic Regression
    (AP=0.790)" and a yellow/gold stepped line for "Random Forest (AP=0.890)". A red
    horizontal dashed baseline labeled "Random Baseline (0.31)" indicates random classifier
    performance at y≈0.31. The X-axis is labeled "Recall" (range 0-1) and Y-axis is
    labeled "Precision" (range 0-1). The legend appears at the top-left corner with
    colored squares identifying each series. Grid lines are subtle and dashed. Both
    curves demonstrate the typical precision-recall tradeoff, with Random Forest outperforming
    Logistic Regression.'
