quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast logic using value threshold to switch between white/black
    text
  - Perfect implementation of diverging colormap with meaningful midpoint at zero
  - Clean KISS code structure following best practices
  - Proper categorical ordering for matrix display
  - Appropriate font sizes for 4800×2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels say "Sector" without indicating this is a correlation matrix (could
    be more descriptive)
  - Random correlation data could have more realistic sector relationships (e.g.,
    Tech-Finance correlation patterns)
