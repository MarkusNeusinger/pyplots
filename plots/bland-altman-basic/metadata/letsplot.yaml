review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent annotation implementation using geom_label with color-matched text and
    white fill for high visibility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement comparison scenario with appropriate sample
    size (80 observations)
  - 'All required Bland-Altman elements present: mean bias line, ±1.96 SD limits of
    agreement, clear annotations'
  - Good use of theme_minimal with customized text sizes for publication quality
  weaknesses:
  - Point size could be slightly larger (size=6-7 instead of 5) for better visibility
    at full resolution
  - Could add tooltips for interactivity since letsplot supports it
  - Grid styling uses hardcoded color instead of leveraging theme defaults
  image_description: The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement analysis comparing
    two blood pressure measurement methods. The visualization shows 80 blue scatter
    points with moderate transparency (alpha=0.7) plotted against a white background
    with subtle gray grid lines. The x-axis shows "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" ranging
    from approximately 90 to 155 mmHg, and the y-axis shows "Difference (Method 1
    - Method 2) (mmHg)" ranging from about -20 to +12. A solid green horizontal line
    indicates the mean bias at -2.55 mmHg, while red dashed horizontal lines mark
    the limits of agreement at +7.84 mmHg (upper) and -12.93 mmHg (lower). Each reference
    line has a clearly visible boxed label positioned on the left side with color-matched
    text (green for bias, red for LoA). The title "bland-altman-basic · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The layout is clean and well-proportioned with
    good use of the canvas space.
