review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of RSI technical indicator with all required visual elements
    (zones, thresholds, centerline)
  - Proper RSI calculation using exponential moving average method with 14-period
    lookback
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with appropriate geoms (geom_rect, geom_hline,
    geom_line)
  - Perfect title format and text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Semantic color usage (red for overbought zone, green for oversold zone)
  weaknesses:
  - RSI data does not demonstrate values entering the overbought zone (>70) which
    would showcase the full range of the indicator
  - Could add hover tooltips using lets-plot interactivity features to show exact
    RSI values
  image_description: The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart with a 14-period lookback. The Y-axis ranges from 0 to 100 with
    key levels marked at 0, 30, 50, 70, and 100. The X-axis shows trading days from
    June to October 2024 (Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct). The RSI line is rendered in a
    deep blue color (#306998) with good line thickness. The overbought zone (70-100)
    is shaded in light red/pink with a dashed red horizontal line at 70. The oversold
    zone (0-30) is shaded in light green with a dashed green horizontal line at 30.
    A dotted gray centerline at 50 divides the chart. The RSI values fluctuate realistically
    between approximately 28 and 68, spending most time in the neutral zone, with
    several approaches to the oversold threshold around 30. The title "indicator-rsi
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Layout is clean with good use of
    whitespace and the minimal theme provides excellent readability.
