review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of notched box plots using creative SVG manipulation
    since pygal lacks native support
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required statistical elements (notches, quartiles,
    whiskers, outliers)
  - Outstanding data quality with realistic server benchmark scenario demonstrating
    overlapping and non-overlapping confidence intervals
  - Good colorblind-accessible color palette
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (calc_box_stats, y_to_svg) instead of inline code,
    violating the KISS structure requirement
  - Legend at bottom is somewhat redundant with x-axis category labels
  - Minor layout issue with extra whitespace on right side
