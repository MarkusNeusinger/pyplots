review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features with linked selection styling (selected/unselected
    markers)
  - Clean colorblind-accessible color palette with good visual distinction
  - Proper axis labeling with units on edges only, avoiding clutter
  - Dual output format (PNG + interactive HTML) maximizes usefulness
  - Well-structured code following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes "Iris Dataset" prefix instead of pure "{spec-id} · {library}
    · pyplots.ai"
  - Diagonal histograms overlap significantly making individual species distributions
    harder to read
  - No explicit random seed (though data is deterministic from dataset)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) of the Iris
    dataset with four variables: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal
    Width (all in cm). Three species are color-coded: Setosa (dark blue #306998),
    Versicolor (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica (cyan/teal #4ECDC4). The diagonal cells
    show overlaid histograms for each species. Off-diagonal cells show pairwise scatter
    plots. The title reads "Iris Dataset · scatter-matrix-interactive · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. A legend on the right shows the species color mapping. The layout
    is well-organized with axis labels on edges only, and markers have appropriate
    size with some transparency. Clear clustering patterns are visible, especially
    separating Setosa from the other species.'
