review:
  strengths:
  - Creative interpretation showing Mercator distortion data on a world map
  - Good use of pygal_maps_world extension for choropleth mapping
  - Clean color palette that effectively shows distortion gradients from high to low
    latitude
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Educational data showing real cartographic concept
  weaknesses:
  - Does not fulfill the core spec requirement to show different cartographic projections
    - only shows one map with data about a different projection distortion
  - Missing graticule (latitude/longitude grid lines) as specified
  - Missing Tissot indicatrices visualization as mentioned in spec
  - Spec asks for same map in multiple projections side-by-side for comparison or
    a single projection with clear title - this does neither
  - pygal_maps_world only supports one projection type, limiting spec compliance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map using pygal_maps_world with countries
    colored according to Mercator projection distortion levels. The title reads "Mercator
    Projection Distortion · map-projections · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. Countries
    are color-coded into four categories: Red for "Extreme (>2.5x)" distortion (Greenland,
    Russia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland), light orange/salmon for "High (1.3-2.5x)"
    (US, Argentina), pale yellow for "Moderate (1.1-1.3x)" (Australia, South Africa,
    UK, Germany, France, Japan, New Zealand, Chile), and green for "Minimal (<1.1x)"
    (Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia, Nigeria, DR Congo). The legend is placed
    at the bottom with all four categories shown. The map has a white background with
    clean gray country borders. Countries not in the dataset are shown in light gray.'
