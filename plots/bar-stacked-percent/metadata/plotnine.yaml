review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of position_fill() for 100% stacking with matching text positioning
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper aesthetic mappings
  - Well-chosen color palette using Python Blue as primary color with harmonious complements
  - Percentage labels only shown for segments >= 8%, avoiding clutter
  - Proper categorical ordering ensures consistent segment order across all bars
  - Theme customization provides excellent text legibility at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis scale shows 0.00-1.00 (proportions) while label says Market Share (%) -
    minor inconsistency but not misleading since percentages are labeled in bars
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing smartphone
    market share by quarter from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024. Six vertical bars represent each
    quarter, with each bar normalized to 100% (shown as 0.00-1.00 on y-axis). Four
    segments per bar represent: Apple (Python Blue), Samsung (Python Yellow), Xiaomi
    (Green), and Others (Gray). Each segment displays a percentage label in white
    bold text (e.g., 23%, 22%, 12%, 43% for Q1 2023). The y-axis is labeled "Market
    Share (%)", x-axis shows "Quarter" with clear quarterly labels. A legend on the
    right identifies all four companies. The title correctly follows the format "bar-stacked-percent
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai".'

          and comprehensive `theme()` customization'
