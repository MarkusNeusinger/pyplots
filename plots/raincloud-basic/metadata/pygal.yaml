review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using pygal XY chart to construct a complex raincloud
    plot from primitives
  - Proper KDE calculation for half-violin density estimation using Silverman rule
  - Clean separation of the three raincloud components (cloud, box, rain)
  - Good color palette with distinct, accessible colors for each treatment group
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with appropriate reaction time values
  - Properly includes outliers in the data to demonstrate distribution features
  weaknesses:
  - Box plot elements are quite thin and hard to see against the violin and scatter
    points
  - Legend at bottom duplicates the x-axis category labels creating redundancy
  - Jittered points rendered in black instead of matching group colors reducing visual
    cohesion
  - The half-violin fill opacity makes it hard to see the box plot behind it
