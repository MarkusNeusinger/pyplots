review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard layout demonstrating GridSpec with main plot spanning 2x2
    cells
  - Good variety of seaborn plot types (6 different visualizations) showcasing library
    breadth
  - Financial dashboard scenario is realistic and coherent with interconnected data
    (price, volume, returns, correlations)
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter for palettes
  - Clean color scheme with colorblind-safe palettes (viridis, Set2, RdBu_r)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing rowspan example - spec mentions cells spanning multiple rows (e.g., tall
    sidebar plot) but all cells only span columns
  - Heatmap y-axis label text appears concatenated/overlapping due to tight spacing
  image_description: 'The plot shows a dashboard-style layout with 6 subplots arranged
    in a custom grid. The main plot (top-left, spanning 2x2 cells) displays a "Daily
    Price Trend" line chart with a blue line (#306998) and light blue fill beneath,
    showing price ranging from ~100 to ~80 over time from Dec 29 to Apr 27. Top-right
    shows a yellow scatter plot (#FFD43B) titled "Correlation Analysis" with Variable
    X vs Y. Middle-right displays a "Quarterly Performance" boxplot with Q1-Q4 in
    Set2 colors (teal, coral, olive, pink). Bottom row contains three smaller plots:
    "Monthly Volume" bar chart with viridis palette (Jan-Dec), "Returns Distribution"
    histogram with KDE curve and yellow zero-reference line, and a "Correlation Matrix"
    heatmap in RdBu_r diverging colormap showing Price/Volume/Returns correlations.
    The main title "subplot-grid-custom · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in bold.'
