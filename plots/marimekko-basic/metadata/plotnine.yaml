review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of variable-width stacked bars using geom_rect with precise
    coordinate calculations
  - Clean, readable code with well-documented data transformation logic
  - Professional appearance with white borders between segments enhancing visual separation
  - Smart conditional labeling showing values only on segments >10% for readability
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics (aes, scales, themes)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines on y-axis could use alpha transparency for subtler appearance
  - Legend is sorted alphabetically rather than matching the stacking order in the
    bars
  image_description: The plot displays a Marimekko chart showing market share by region
    and product line. Four regions (Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America)
    are shown as variable-width stacked bars where width represents total market size.
    Each bar is divided into four product categories (Electronics in dark blue, Hardware
    in coral/red, Services in teal, Software in yellow). The bars have white borders
    between segments. Value labels (e.g., "$200M", "$140M") appear on larger segments.
    The y-axis shows percentage (0%-100%), x-axis shows region names centered under
    each bar. A legend on the right identifies the four product lines. The title follows
    the required format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (geom_rect, geom_text, scale_*, theme), but geom_rect
          is basic; could have used coord_fixed or more advanced grammar features
