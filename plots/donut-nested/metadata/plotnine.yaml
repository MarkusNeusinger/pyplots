review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data representation with clear parent-child relationships
  - Consistent color families (same hue, varying lightness) as specified
  - Gap between inner and outer rings provides good visual separation
  - Smart labeling strategy - only labels segments >= 80K threshold
  - White bold text on inner ring provides excellent contrast
  - Clean theme with all axis elements properly hidden
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario matches spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function slightly deviates from KISS principle but is necessary for the
    polygon-based approach
  - Outer ring labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a nested donut chart showing budget allocation
    by department. The inner ring shows four parent categories: Engineering (blue),
    Marketing (yellow), Operations (green), and Sales (red). Each parent has bold
    white text labels. The outer ring shows child categories with lighter shades of
    the parent colors: Engineering has Salaries, Equipment, and Training; Marketing
    has Advertising, Events; Sales has Commissions, Travel; Operations has IT Infrastructure,
    Facilities. Child segment labels are in dark gray text. There is a clear gap between
    the inner and outer rings for visual separation. The title "Budget Allocation
    by Department · donut-nested · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The
    plot uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with the donut centered and good canvas utilization.'

          Title is clear. Slight deduction as outer labels could be slightly larger.

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_polygon, scale_fill_identity,
          coord_fixed. Creative solution using polygons since plotnine lacks native
          pie/donut geoms. Minor deduction as it relies on manual polygon construction
          rather than ggplot-native pie approach.
  verdict: APPROVED
