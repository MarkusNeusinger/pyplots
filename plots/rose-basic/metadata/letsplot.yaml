review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent rose chart implementation using lets-plot coord_polar with geom_bar
  - Beautiful blue-to-yellow color gradient that follows Python brand colors and provides
    clear value differentiation
  - Proper month ordering using pd.Categorical to maintain natural calendar sequence
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate theme_minimal with well-tuned text sizes (24pt title, 18pt y-axis,
    16pt month labels)
  - Chart starts at January at top (12 o'clock) as recommended in spec for time data
  weaknesses:
  - Radial gridlines (panel_grid_major_y) could be more subtle with lower alpha for
    cleaner appearance
  - The y-axis title appears on the left side which is slightly awkward for polar
    coordinates
  image_description: The plot displays a rose chart (polar bar chart) showing monthly
    rainfall distribution. The chart is centered on the canvas with months arranged
    clockwise starting from January at the top (12 o'clock position). Each wedge represents
    a month with the radius proportional to rainfall amount. Colors transition smoothly
    from Python Blue (#306998) for winter months through greens and yellows to Python
    Yellow (#FFD43B) for December. July has the longest bar (168mm), while February
    has the shortest (65mm). The title reads "Monthly Rainfall Distribution · rose-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. Radial gridlines are visible at 20mm
    intervals (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160). The y-axis label "Rainfall
    (mm)" appears on the left side. Month labels are positioned around the outer edge
    of the chart.
