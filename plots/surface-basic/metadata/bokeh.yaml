review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent creative solution: Bokeh lacks native 3D support, but the implementation
    cleverly uses patches with painters algorithm for depth-sorted 3D surface rendering'
  - Proper use of Viridis256 colormap and LinearColorMapper for color encoding
  - Clean isometric projection with configurable elevation and azimuth angles
  - Subtle edge styling enhances 3D perception without being distracting
  - Colorbar correctly shows Z value scale
  - Good canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with appropriate font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X, Y, Z) without descriptive context or units
  - Colorbar title Z Value is truncated/rotated, could be improved
  - The HTML output is also generated which may not be necessary for static review
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D surface rendered in 2D using an isometric
    projection. The surface represents z = sin(x) * cos(y), showing smooth wave-like
    undulations. The Viridis colormap is used, with yellow/green representing peaks
    (z ≈ 0.5 to 1) and dark purple/blue representing valleys (z ≈ -1 to -0.5). The
    title "surface-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. Axis
    labels X, Y, and Z are placed around the plot in gray text. A vertical colorbar
    on the right shows "Z Value" with tick marks from -0.5 to 0.5. The surface is
    rendered with subtle blue (#306998) edge lines and the background is light gray
    (#fafafa). The plot fills the canvas well with good proportions.
