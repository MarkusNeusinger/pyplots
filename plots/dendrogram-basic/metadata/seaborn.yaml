review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe palette for accessibility
  - Clear species separation visible in the dendrogram structure
  - Good label formatting with species-sample number convention
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels
  - Uses real Iris dataset making it educational and realistic
  - Clean visual style with seaborn whitegrid theme
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is primarily used for styling (set_theme, despine, color_palette) rather
    than actual plotting functions - the core dendrogram comes from scipy
  - Legend color squares do not perfectly match the x-axis label text colors due to
    how matplotlib handles text vs patch colors
  - Minor code complexity with for loops that could be simplified
