review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curve with all required spec features
    (diagonal reference, binning, Brier score, histogram)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of Altair layering and vconcat for combining charts
  - Appropriate color scheme with good contrast between calibration line (blue) and
    reference line (yellow dashed)
  - Subtitle elegantly displays the Brier score metric
  - Tooltips included on data points for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines which would aid in reading exact values from the calibration
    curve
  - Histogram bars could use slight spacing/gap for better visual separation
  image_description: 'The plot shows a calibration curve visualization with two vertically
    stacked charts. The main chart (top) displays the calibration curve with a solid
    blue line (#306998) connecting filled circular markers representing binned mean
    predicted probabilities on the X-axis vs. fraction of positives on the Y-axis.
    A yellow dashed diagonal line represents perfect calibration. The title reads
    "calibration-curve · altair · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Brier Score:
    0.1388". The bottom chart is a histogram showing the distribution of predicted
    probabilities using blue bars. Both axes are clearly labeled with appropriate
    font sizes. The calibration curve demonstrates a slightly overconfident classifier
    that falls below the diagonal for lower probabilities and approaches/crosses it
    at higher values.'
