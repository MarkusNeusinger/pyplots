quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data variety showing different distribution shapes (tight, wide, bimodal,
    with outliers)
  - Clean layered architecture combining mark_boxplot and mark_circle
  - Creative use of transform_calculate for jitter implementation
  - Good visual balance with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Yellow median line provides good contrast against blue boxes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain box plot vs strip point representation
  - No tooltips for interactivity (Altair strength not fully utilized)
