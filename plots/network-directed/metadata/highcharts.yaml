review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of software module dependencies as realistic data scenario
  - Good use of Highcharts networkgraph module with force-directed layout algorithm
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme (blue edges, yellow nodes)
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Node labels are readable with text outline styling
  weaknesses:
  - Arrow markers are inconsistent and small - the custom SVG marker workaround does
    not reliably apply arrows to all edges
  - Force-directed layout lacks reproducibility (no seed/deterministic positioning)
  - Code uses JavaScript functions which violates the KISS structure requirement
  - 'Edge thickness (width: 3) is too thin for the 4800x2700 canvas - arrows are barely
    visible'
  - Network occupies only ~40-50% of canvas area; could be larger
