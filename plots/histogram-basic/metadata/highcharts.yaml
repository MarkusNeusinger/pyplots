review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native HistogramSeries with base_series pattern for
    automatic binning
  - Strong data storytelling with grade-range plotBands, mean/median plotLines, and
    peak annotations
  - Publication-quality design with custom typography, subtle shadows, refined borders,
    and cohesive color palette
  - Realistic and engaging educational dataset (bimodal exam score distribution)
  - Correct title format with descriptive context
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title Exam Score (points) is not visible in the rendered image — the bottom
    margin needs to be increased or the axis title margin adjusted
  - Mean and Median labels (75.3 and 75.8) are very close together and visually crowded
    — consider offsetting them more or combining into a single annotation
  - Post-render annotation JavaScript uses hardcoded y=53 and setTimeout(2000) which
    is brittle — could use chart options annotations instead
  - The annotations module is loaded via separate download but annotations are applied
    via raw JavaScript, creating an inconsistency in approach
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of university exam scores using
    deep blue (#306998) bars on a light gray (#fafbfc) background. The title reads
    "Exam Score Distribution · histogram-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold
    dark text, with a subtitle describing "500 students — Introduction to Statistics,
    Fall 2024" and the bimodal pattern. The X-axis spans from ~35 to ~95 with tick
    marks every 5 points, and the Y-axis ("Number of Students") ranges from 0 to 60.
    Grade-range plotBands (D/F in faint red, C in faint orange, B in faint green,
    A in faint blue, A+ in faint purple) are visible at the top of the chart area.
    A red dashed vertical line marks the Mean (75.3) and a blue dotted line marks
    the Median (75.8), both with labels. Two annotation callouts with connector lines
    point to the "Primary peak" (~72 pts, main group 80%) and "Secondary peak" (~88
    pts, high achievers 20%). Bars have dark blue borders and no gaps between them.
    The bimodal distribution is clearly visible with the main cluster of tall bars
    around 65-80 and a secondary grouping around 85-95. The x-axis title "Exam Score
    (points)" is NOT visible in the rendered image — it appears cut off at the bottom
    margin.

        comment: HistogramSeries with base_series is distinctive. plotBands/plotLines
          are Highcharts-specific. Annotation approach somewhat hacky.
  verdict: APPROVED
