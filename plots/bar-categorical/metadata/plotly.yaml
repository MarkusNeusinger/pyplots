review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with excellent text legibility at all sizes
  - Correct implementation of categorical counting from raw data with proper sorting
  - Good use of value labels above bars for quick reading
  - Appropriate color scheme and bar styling with borders
  - Follows KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates to enhance
    interactivity
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible for better
    readability
