review:
  strengths:
  - Manual hexagonal binning computation is well-implemented and produces clean, properly
    tiled hexagons
  - 'Excellent use of Altair-specific features: interactive hover selection, conditional
    encoding, custom SVG shape paths, and rich tooltips'
  - Strong data storytelling with three named geographic clusters and contextual subtitle
  - 'High visual refinement: subtle grid, removed view stroke, light background, text
    halo annotations, custom axis styling'
  - Symlog color scale handles density variation effectively as suggested by the spec
  weaknesses:
  - Some edge hexagons appear slightly inconsistent in visual size compared to central
    ones
  - Industrial zone tight cluster creates a bright hotspot that slightly muddies the
    density narrative
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization of Seattle
    metropolitan traffic density based on 5,000 GPS vehicle observations. The chart
    uses pointy-top hexagonal shapes rendered via custom SVG paths, colored using
    the viridis colormap ranging from dark purple (low vehicle counts, ~1-10) through
    teal/green (medium, ~20-60) to bright yellow (high, ~80-100+). Three distinct
    geographic clusters are visible: a Downtown Core cluster (bottom-center) with
    the highest density bright-yellow hexagons, a Shopping District cluster (right
    side, around lat 47.62) with broad medium-to-high density, and a smaller Industrial
    Zone cluster (upper-left) that is sparser overall but has a tight bright center.
    Each cluster is labeled with a text annotation using a white halo effect for readability.
    The background is light gray (#f9f9fb), grid lines are extremely subtle (0.08
    opacity), and the view has no border stroke. A vertical color bar on the right
    labeled "Vehicle Count" shows the density scale. The title reads "hexbin-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Seattle metropolitan traffic density —
    5,000 GPS vehicle observations." Axis labels show "Longitude (°W)" and "Latitude
    (°N)" with formatted tick values.'
