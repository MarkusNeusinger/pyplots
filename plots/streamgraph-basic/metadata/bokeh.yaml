review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the centered baseline algorithm creating proper symmetric
    streamgraph
  - Smooth polynomial interpolation (degree 10) creates flowing, organic curves that
    look professional
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue (#306998), distinct adjacent
    colors
  - Proper use of Bokeh patch method for filled polygon areas
  - Well-sized text elements appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic music streaming data scenario that matches specification perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for the canvas size
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity which is a key Bokeh strength
  - Y-axis label says relative but could benefit from units
  image_description: 'The plot displays a streamgraph (centered stacked area chart)
    showing "Streaming Hours (relative)" over time from January 2022 to January 2024.
    Six music genres are shown as flowing, stacked layers: Pop (Python blue #306998),
    Rock (golden yellow #FFD43B), Hip-Hop (coral/salmon #E07A5F), Electronic (muted
    teal/green #81B29A), Jazz (cream/tan #F2CC8F), and Classical (dark gray-blue #3D405B).
    The baseline is centered around 0 on the y-axis, creating a symmetric river-like
    appearance. The layers have smooth, flowing curves showing seasonal variations
    over the 2-year period. A legend is positioned on the right side identifying each
    genre. The title "streamgraph-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.
    X-axis shows time periods (Jan 2022 through Jan 2024), Y-axis shows "Streaming
    Hours (relative)" ranging from approximately -100 to +100.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, figure, patch, Legend, and export_png/save
          appropriately, but doesn't leverage HoverTool for interactivity which would
          be a distinctive Bokeh feature
  verdict: APPROVED
