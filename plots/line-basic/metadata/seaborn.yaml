review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing following the library guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Clean sinusoidal data pattern effectively demonstrates seasonal trends
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with appropriate styling (linewidth=3, marker=o,
    markersize=12)
  - Realistic temperature scenario with plausible values for temperate climate
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-balanced 16:9 layout with no clipping or overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Data shows a very smooth sinusoidal pattern; could benefit from slightly more
    variation to show real-world noise
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive statistical features (confidence intervals,
    error bands)
