  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic weekly patterns, growth trend, and a
    traffic spike event that showcases the area chart ability to highlight volume
    changes
  - Clean, well-proportioned layout with the plot filling the canvas effectively
  - Proper use of Altair declarative grammar including typed encodings, tooltip formatting,
    and scale configuration
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output, leveraging Altair web-native capabilities
  - Semi-transparent fill (0.4) with solid line border creates clear visual distinction
    between the area and the line
  weaknesses:
  - The first x-axis tick label shows 2024 instead of a formatted date — a minor Altair
    temporal axis default that slightly breaks the consistent date label pattern
  - No gradient fill from line to axis baseline, which the spec suggests considering
    for visual appeal
  - Could leverage more distinctive Altair features like selection parameters or layered
    marks (e.g., a point mark layer for individual data points on hover)
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 data points). The area is filled with a semi-transparent
    blue (#306998, opacity 0.4) with a solid blue line border (strokeWidth 3). The
    x-axis shows dates labeled with day-of-week abbreviations and day numbers (e.g.,
    "Wed 03", "Fri 05"), with the first tick showing "2024". The y-axis ranges from
    0 to approximately 10,000 and is labeled "Daily Visitors (count)". The title "area-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in a large font. Subtle dashed
    gridlines are visible across the chart area. The data shows clear weekly cyclical
    patterns (weekday highs around 5,500-7,500, weekend dips around 3,500-5,000),
    a visible upward growth trend across the month, and a prominent traffic spike
    around January 15 reaching approximately 9,400 visitors. The layout is clean and
    well-proportioned with balanced margins.
