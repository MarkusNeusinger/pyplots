  strengths:
  - Excellent date label handling using x_labels_major to show only first of each
    month, preventing clutter
  - Clean, realistic stock price simulation with trend and volatility that clearly
    demonstrates temporal patterns
  - Proper use of pygal Style class with appropriately scaled font sizes for the large
    canvas
  - 'Good layout decisions: no dots for dense data, legend at bottom, rotated labels'
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could be shown on both axes as recommended in spec (currently only Y-axis
    guides shown)
  - Stroke width of 5 works but could be slightly thicker (e.g., 6-8) for better visibility
    at full resolution
  - HTML output could leverage pygal interactivity features (tooltips, hover effects)
    more explicitly
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series line chart showing "ACME Corp
    Stock" prices over the year 2024 (Jan-Dec). The chart uses a single blue line
    (Python Blue #306998) on a white background. The title "line-timeseries · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text. The Y-axis shows "Stock Price
    (USD)" ranging from approximately 150 to 270, and the X-axis shows "Date" with
    monthly labels (Jan 2024 through Dec 2024) rotated at 45 degrees. The line shows
    an overall upward trend with realistic daily volatility - starting around 150,
    dipping slightly in February, then gradually climbing through the year with some
    corrections (notably in September) before reaching approximately 265 by December.
    A legend "ACME Corp Stock" appears at the bottom left. Y-axis grid lines (dotted,
    light gray) provide reference. The chart has good proportions with balanced margins.'

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick labels are all readable. Font sizes
          are appropriately scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas, though tick labels could
          be slightly larger.

        comment: Line is clearly visible with stroke width of 5. No dots shown (appropriate
          for 365 data points). Line thickness is appropriate for the data density.

          No color accessibility concerns.

        comment: Plot fills good portion of canvas with reasonable margins. Legend
          at bottom is well-positioned, though margin=60 is relatively small for such
          a large canvas.

        comment: Y-axis grid is subtle (dotted, light gray). Legend is positioned
          at bottom. X-guides disabled which is appropriate.

        comment: Uses custom Style class, x_labels_major for intelligent labeling,
          legend_at_bottom, stroke_style. Could leverage more pygal-specific features
          like tooltips for interactivity in HTML output.
  verdict: APPROVED
