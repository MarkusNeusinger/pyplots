review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts polar column configuration for rose chart
  - Perfect title format and subtitle providing context
  - Clean polygon gridlines enhance readability
  - Good canvas utilization with 85% pane size
  - Realistic monthly rainfall scenario ideal for demonstrating cyclical data
  - Data labels on each segment aid value reading
  - Proper inline JS loading for headless Chrome compatibility
  weaknesses:
  - startAngle of -15 degrees shifts January slightly off the 12 o'clock position
    (spec suggests top for time data)
  - Y-axis tick labels could include units (mm) for better clarity
  - Could benefit from Highcharts-specific interactive features in the HTML version
    (tooltip formatting)
