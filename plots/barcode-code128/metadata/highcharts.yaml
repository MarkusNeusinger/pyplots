review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Code 128B encoding with proper check digit calculation
  - Proper quiet zones on left and right sides for scanner compatibility
  - Human-readable text in monospace font below barcode as per spec
  - Good use of Highcharts renderer API for custom bar drawing
  - Clean visual presentation with high contrast black-on-white design
  - Title follows the correct format
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (encode_code128, values_to_bars) instead of pure linear
    KISS structure
  - Could demonstrate Code 128 subset switching (A/B/C) for more comprehensive example
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode visualization on a white
    background. At the top, the title "barcode-code128 · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed in bold dark gray text (approximately 48px), followed by a subtitle
    "Code 128 Barcode Visualization" in lighter gray (approximately 32px). The main
    element is a properly formatted Code 128 barcode consisting of alternating black
    vertical bars of varying widths on a white background. The barcode spans approximately
    80% of the horizontal canvas width with appropriate quiet zones (white space)
    on both the left and right sides as required by the specification. The bars vary
    in width from thin (1-unit) to thick (4-unit) following the Code 128 encoding
    pattern. Below the barcode, the human-readable text "SHIP-2024-ABC123" is displayed
    in a bold monospace font (Courier New) at 72px with letter spacing, centered horizontally
    beneath the barcode. The overall layout is clean and professional with good use
    of the 4800x2700 canvas space, presenting a realistic shipping label barcode that
    would be scannable in a real-world application.
