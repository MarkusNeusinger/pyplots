review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three targeted annotations that guide the viewer
    through key insights (salary gap, outlier explanation, distribution tightness)
  - Custom cohesive muted palette anchored on Python Blue with good colorblind accessibility
  - 'Strong use of plotnine-specific features: stat_summary for diamond median markers,
    annotate label with styled backgrounds, lambda-based tick formatters'
  - Well-crafted data with realistic salary distributions showing variety in medians,
    spreads, and outlier patterns
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with all explicit font sizing
  weaknesses:
  - The Senior hires above market rate annotation connector segment is too short and
    does not clearly point to the Sales outlier cluster — a curved arrow or longer
    segment would improve clarity
  - The dashed reference line spans the full plot width rather than specifically connecting
    Support and Engineering boxes, slightly diluting its purpose as a gap indicator
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one per department (Support, Marketing, Sales, Research, Engineering), with salary
    on the y-axis ranging from $20k to $160k. Each box uses a distinct muted color:
    light blue for Support, peach/orange for Marketing, lavender/pink for Sales, mint
    green for Research, and dark Python Blue for Engineering. Outliers appear as red
    dots — notably 4 clustered Sales outliers near $130k-$140k and one Research outlier
    near $17k and one Engineering outlier near $130k. Black diamond markers indicate
    medians within each box. Three annotations provide narrative: (1) bold blue text
    at top reading "Engineering earns $39k more than Support" with a dashed blue reference
    line spanning the full width at ~$144k, (2) a pink-background label "Senior hires
    above market rate" with a small red connector segment near the Sales outliers,
    and (3) italic gray text "Narrow spread (σ ≈ $8k)" below the Support box. The
    title "box-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is large and bold at the top. Axis labels
    read "Department" (x) and "Salary ($)" (y) with dollar-formatted tick labels.
    The background is clean white with subtle horizontal gridlines only.'
