review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation
  - Good use of geom_contourf + geom_contour layering for filled contours with line
    overlay
  - Appropriate terrain-like colormap with green (low) to white (high) gradient
  - Realistic Western US mountain scenario with multiple distinct peaks
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Missing geographic basemap overlay (coastlines, borders) as required by spec
  - Missing contour line labels with elevation values as specified
  - White contour lines are too subtle in light-colored high elevation areas
  - Legend colorbar shows range up to 7,000m but actual max elevation is ~4,400m
  image_description: The plot shows a contour map with filled regions (contourf) and
    overlaid contour lines representing elevation data across a geographic region
    spanning approximately 35°-45° latitude and -120° to -105° longitude (Western
    US mountains). The color scheme uses a green-to-tan-to-white gradient representing
    elevation from low (~1,000m, dark green) to high (~7,000m, white). Multiple mountain
    peaks are visible as white/light-colored concentrations - notably one large peak
    in the center-right area (around lat 43, lon -110) and another in the upper-left
    quadrant (around lat 44, lon -118). Subtle white contour lines overlay the filled
    regions. The title correctly follows the format "contour-map-geographic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai". The colorbar legend on the right shows "Elevation (m)" with values
    from 1,000 to 7,000. Axis labels show "Longitude" and "Latitude" appropriately.

        comment: Uses ggplot-style grammar with geom_contourf, geom_contour, scale_fill_gradient2,
          coord_fixed, and theme customization. Could leverage more lets-plot specific
          features like interactive tooltips.
