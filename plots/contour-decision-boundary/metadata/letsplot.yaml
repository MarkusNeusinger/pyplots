review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the decision boundary using geom_tile for filled
    regions
  - Clear distinction between correctly and incorrectly classified points using shape
    encoding
  - Appropriate use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with proper layering (background
    regions + foreground points)
  - 'Good color scheme with Python colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that is colorblind-accessible'
  - 'Comprehensive legend system showing all three aspects: predicted class, true
    class, and classification accuracy'
  weaknesses:
  - Three separate legends consume significant horizontal space; could potentially
    be consolidated
  - Axis labels lack meaningful domain context (just Feature X1/X2 since using synthetic
    data)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a decision boundary classifier visualization
    using the make_moons dataset. The feature space is divided into two regions: a
    light blue region (predicted class 0) primarily covering the left and upper portions,
    and a light yellow/gold region (predicted class 1) covering the right and lower
    portions. The curved decision boundary between regions clearly shows the KNN classifier''s
    ability to separate the two moon-shaped clusters. Training data points are overlaid
    as circles (correctly classified) and X markers (incorrectly classified). Blue
    circles/X marks represent true class 0, yellow circles/X marks represent true
    class 1. Three separate legends on the right side explain: Predicted Class, True
    Class, and Classification status. The title "contour-decision-boundary · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at top. Axis labels show "Feature X1" (x-axis) and "Feature
    X2" (y-axis).'
