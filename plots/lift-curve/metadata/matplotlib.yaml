review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lift curve with proper calculation methodology (sort
    by score, cumulative lift at each percentage)
  - Clear visual distinction between model lift curve and random baseline with appropriate
    colors
  - Well-placed decile annotations that show practical lift values at key targeting
    thresholds
  - Shaded area between curves provides intuitive visualization of model value
  - Realistic customer response data with appropriate base rate and sample size
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarification (e.g., Cumulative Lift (ratio))
  - Does not leverage distinctive matplotlib features beyond basic plotting capabilities
