review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent lift curve visualization that clearly demonstrates model performance
    vs random selection
  - Well-implemented decile markers provide clear reference points for business decisions
  - Realistic customer churn prediction scenario with appropriate lift values
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good use of Altair layering to combine lift line, reference line, markers, and
    annotation
  - Tooltips add interactive value for exploring specific lift values
  weaknesses:
  - Could add a small legend to label the lift curve line
  - Annotation text placement could be slightly adjusted to avoid visual proximity
    to the reference line
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve showing cumulative lift on the
    Y-axis (ranging from 0 to 5.0) against population targeted percentage on the X-axis
    (0-100%). The main lift curve is a solid blue line (#306998) that starts high
    at approximately 5.0 (capped by the Y-axis scale) at the far left, then gradually
    decreases in a smooth curve as the population percentage increases, eventually
    approaching 1.0 at 100%. Blue filled circular markers are placed at decile points
    (10%, 20%, 30%, etc.) along the curve. A gray dashed horizontal reference line
    at y=1 represents random selection, with the annotation "Random Selection (Lift
    = 1)" placed near it. The title "lift-curve · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top center. Axis labels are clearly readable with "Population Targeted
    (%)" on the X-axis and "Cumulative Lift" on the Y-axis. The background has subtle
    grid lines.
