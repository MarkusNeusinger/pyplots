review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships visible
    through spatial adjacency
  - Smart label hiding for narrow rectangles prevents text overlap
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax with mark_rect and transform_calculate
  - Interactive tooltips enhance usability
  - File system example matches specification suggested application perfectly
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with iterative tree building
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses only blue hues which may reduce accessibility for some colorblind
    users; consider using more distinct hues across levels
  - Some leaf nodes appear very narrow making the hierarchy harder to read in that
    section
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal icicle chart showing a file system
    hierarchy. The root node (dark blue) spans the entire width at the bottom (level
    0). Level 1 shows three main folders: "Documents", "Media", and "Projects" in
    medium blue. Level 2 shows subfolders including "Reports", "Videos", and "Audio"
    in lighter blue. Level 3 (lightest blue) shows leaf files like "tutorial.mp4",
    "demo.mp4", and "podcast.mp3". The rectangles are separated by white strokes.
    A legend on the right shows levels 0-3. The title "icicle-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The Y-axis is labeled "Hierarchy Level" with values
    0-4.'
