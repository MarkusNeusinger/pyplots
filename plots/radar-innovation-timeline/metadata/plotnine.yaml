review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all specification features implemented including 270-degree
    arc, ring fills, sector spokes, collision avoidance, and legend
  - Strong visual hierarchy through variable marker size and alpha by ring, making
    near-term items visually prominent
  - Realistic, well-chosen technology data with plausible ring assignments
  - Clean code structure with well-organized sections and a clever iterative label
    nudging algorithm
  - Cohesive color design with pastel ring fills harmonizing with bold sector marker
    colors
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation labels at size 9 are somewhat small for the canvas; increasing to 10-11
    would improve readability
  - Minor label overlap persists in dense areas (Security sector items, inner Adopt
    ring)
  - Canvas utilization could be tighter — notable whitespace above title and below
    legend
  - Blue and green sector colors could be more distinguishable for colorblind viewers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree (three-quarter circle) radar/innovation
    timeline chart on a white background. Four concentric rings represent time horizons:
    "Adopt" (innermost, pale green fill), "Trial" (pale yellow), "Assess" (pale orange),
    and "Hold" (outermost, pale pink). Ring boundary arcs are drawn in light gray,
    with ring names labeled in the bottom gap. The radial space is divided into four
    sectors by gray spoke lines: "Data Engineering" (upper left), "Cloud & Infra"
    (upper right), "Security" (lower left), and "AI & ML" (lower right), each with
    bold black sector headers along the outer edge. Twenty-six innovation items are
    plotted as colored dots — blue for AI & ML, green for Cloud & Infra, orange for
    Data Engineering, and magenta/pink for Security — with marker sizes decreasing
    and alpha fading from inner to outer rings, creating a clear visual hierarchy.
    Each item has a colored text label placed nearby. A category legend with colored
    circles sits at the bottom center, enclosed in a white box with a gray border.
    The title reads "radar-innovation-timeline · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold, with
    an italic subtitle "Inner rings → near-term adoption · Outer rings → future exploration."'

          is on the smaller side for this canvas.

        comment: Markers well-sized with variable sizes by ring (3.5-7). Size/alpha
          hierarchy is effective. Slight density in the Adopt ring.

        comment: Blue, green, orange, magenta are reasonably distinguishable. Not
          pure red-green, but blue vs green could challenge some color vision deficiencies.
