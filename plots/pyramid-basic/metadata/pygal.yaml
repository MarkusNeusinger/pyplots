review:
  strengths:
  - Uses pygal native Pyramid chart type specifically designed for this visualization
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Excellent choice of realistic demographic data (US population by age/gender)
  - Good color contrast between blue (male) and yellow (female)
  - Data clearly shows demographic patterns including female longevity advantage
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned in the top-left corner with very small text, making it hard
    to read and disconnected from the chart
  - Font sizes may need adjustment - legend text appears too small relative to canvas
    size
  - No Y-axis title to label the age groups dimension
