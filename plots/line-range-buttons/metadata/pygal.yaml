review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range selector concept using pygal limitations creatively
    with PIL compositing
  - Interactive HTML version provides functional range buttons that actually work
  - Clean visual design with consistent blue color scheme matching pyplots brand
  - Range navigator mini chart with selection indicator is a nice touch
  - Good use of pygal Style system for customization
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too prominent (should use alpha 0.2-0.4) for a cleaner look
  - Legend placement in top-left corner overlaps with y-axis area, could be positioned
    better
  - Font sizes could be scaled up proportionally for the large canvas size
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart with range selector
    buttons at 4800x2700 resolution. The main chart (top portion) shows "Daily Values"
    from Dec '24 to Dec '25 (1Y range currently selected). The line is rendered in
    blue (#306998) showing price/value fluctuations with a peak around Mar-Apr '25
    (~145) and a valley around Aug '25 (~112). The title "line-range-buttons · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in monospace font. X-axis labeled "Date" with
    monthly labels (Dec '24, Feb '25, Apr '25, etc.). Y-axis labeled "Value" ranging
    from ~112 to ~144. A legend "Daily Values" appears in the top-left. Below the
    main chart is a gray button bar with "Range:" label followed by six buttons (1M,
    3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) - the 1Y button is highlighted in blue indicating selection.
    At the bottom is a smaller "Range Navigator — Full History" mini chart showing
    the complete 2-year dataset with a semi-transparent blue overlay indicating the
    currently selected 1Y range.
