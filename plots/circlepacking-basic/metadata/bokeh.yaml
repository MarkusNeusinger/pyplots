review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing implementation with proper nesting and non-overlapping
    layout
  - Clean color scheme distinguishing three hierarchy levels (blue root, yellow divisions,
    teal teams)
  - All text labels are well-positioned and readable at full resolution
  - HoverTool provides interactive tooltips with name, level, and budget info
  - Proper Legend explaining the color-by-depth scheme
  - Correct title format and appropriate square canvas size (3600x3600)
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Circle packing algorithm is implemented inline which adds complexity; data size
    is small (14 nodes vs spec suggested 20-200)
  - Slight layout imbalance with empty space at bottom of the canvas
  - HTML output is generated alongside PNG which is acceptable but not strictly required
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circle packing chart titled "circlepacking-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai". It shows a hierarchical structure of a technology company
    (TechCorp) budget allocation. The outermost circle is blue (#306998) representing
    the root company level. Inside are three yellow (#FFD43B) division circles: Engineering
    (largest, lower-left), Sales (lower-right), and Operations (upper-center). Within
    each division are teal/cyan (#4ECDC4) team circles - Engineering contains Backend,
    Frontend, Mobile, and DevOps; Sales contains Enterprise, SMB, and Partners; Operations
    contains Finance, HR, and Legal. Circle sizes are proportional to budget values.
    Labels are displayed in bold black text inside each circle. A legend in the top-right
    corner explains the color scheme: Root (Company), Division, and Team. The background
    is light gray (#FAFAFA) and the canvas is square (3600x3600).'
