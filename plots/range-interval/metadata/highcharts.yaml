review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of columnrange chart type perfectly matching the spec
  - Clear seasonal temperature pattern with realistic Northern Hemisphere data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of data labels showing min/max values at bar endpoints for emphasis
  - Proper handling of Highcharts modules (highcharts-more.js for columnrange support)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-right corner isolated from the chart area
  - Data labels font size (18px) could be slightly larger for better readability on
    the large canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a column range chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges for a temperate climate. Each month (Jan-Dec) is represented on the x-axis
    with a vertical blue bar (#306998) spanning from the minimum to maximum temperature.
    Data labels at the top and bottom of each bar show the exact temperature values
    in °C. The chart follows a realistic seasonal pattern: cold winters (Jan at -2.3°C
    to 5.7°C), warming spring, hot summers (Jul peaks at 17.1°C to 28.9°C), and cooling
    autumn. The title "range-interval · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is at the top with
    subtitle "Monthly Temperature Ranges (°C)". Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" and
    x-axis shows "Month". A legend "Temperature Range" appears in the top right. The
    layout is clean with subtle grid lines and good use of canvas space.'
