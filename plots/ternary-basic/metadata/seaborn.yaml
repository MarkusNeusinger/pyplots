review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinate transformation with clean vectorized
    NumPy code
  - Professional appearance with well-designed grid lines at 10% intervals and tick
    marks at 20% intervals
  - Realistic soil composition scenario using Dirichlet distribution for authentic
    compositional data
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid, talk context) and sns.scatterplot for
    the data points
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=200) and transparency (alpha=0.7) for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; the heavy lifting is done with matplotlib
    primitives
  - Grid legend not present (minor issue for single-series data)
  - Square figure (12x12) instead of recommended 16:9 landscape, though appropriate
    for ternary plots
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary diagram showing soil composition
    data. The equilateral triangle has three vertices labeled in bold: "Sand (100%)"
    at bottom-left, "Silt (100%)" at bottom-right, and "Clay (100%)" at the top. The
    triangle is outlined in black with gray grid lines at 10% intervals creating a
    mesh pattern inside. Tick marks with percentage labels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) appear
    along all three edges. Approximately 50 blue circular data points (with white
    edge and alpha transparency) are scattered across the triangle, representing different
    soil compositions. The title "Soil Composition · ternary-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The background is white with a clean, professional appearance.
    The plot uses a square aspect ratio with good utilization of the canvas space.'
