quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style contribution graph aesthetic with appropriate green gradient
    colors
  - Realistic data generation with weekday/weekend patterns and seasonal variation
  - Proper calendar structure with weeks as columns and days as rows
  - Clean title format following the required convention
  - Good use of white borders and rounded corners for visual appeal
  - Comprehensive tooltip implementation with proper pluralization
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom portion of canvas has noticeable empty space; layout could be more balanced
  - Legend title could include a subtitle explaining the scale
  - PNG has slight aspect ratio issue (2661px instead of 2700px)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a GitHub-style calendar heatmap showing daily activity for the year 2024. The visualization uses a grid layout with:
    - **Y-axis**: Weekday labels (Mon through Sun) on the left side
    - **X-axis**: Month labels (Jan through Dec) along the top
    - **Colors**: A sequential green gradient from light gray (#ebedf0) for no activity to dark green (#216e39) for high activity, mimicking GitHub contribution graphs
    - **Title**: "Daily Activity 2024 · heatmap-calendar · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top center
    - **Legend**: Vertical color scale on the right showing "Commits" with values 0-16
    - **Layout**: Each cell represents one day, with weeks as columns and days of the week as rows. White borders separate individual cells with rounded corners.
    - **Data pattern**: Clear weekday vs weekend pattern visible (top rows for Sat/Sun show more gray/light cells), with seasonal variation showing higher activity in spring/fall months.
