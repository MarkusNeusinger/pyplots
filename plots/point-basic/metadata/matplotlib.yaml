review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal layout following spec recommendation for readable category
    labels
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-sized markers and error bar caps
  - Reference line adds valuable context (overall mean) as suggested in spec
  - Varying confidence interval widths demonstrate real-world uncertainty patterns
  - Clean, professional appearance suitable for publication
  weaknesses:
  - Could add alpha transparency to markers for even better visual distinction (minor)
