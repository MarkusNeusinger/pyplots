review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density visualization
  - Clean implementation of three distinct density clusters that clearly demonstrate
    hexbin capabilities
  - Proper title format and well-sized text elements throughout
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics API (ggplot, geom_hex, scale_fill_viridis)
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines that does not distract from the data
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic X Coordinate / Y Coordinate without application context
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features more explicitly in the HTML output
    (tooltips, hover info)
  - Some sparse hexagons at the edges are very small, making density harder to read
    in low-count areas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization showing
    density of 2D point data. Three distinct density clusters are visible: one in
    the upper-right quadrant (around x=3, y=3) with moderate density (cyan/teal colors),
    one in the lower-left area (around x=-2, y=1) with moderate density, and one highly
    concentrated cluster in the lower-center (around x=0, y=-3) showing the highest
    density with yellow/bright green colors (count ~120). The background uses a light
    gray color (#FAFAFA), with subtle dashed gray grid lines. The viridis colormap
    ranges from dark purple (low count ~20) through cyan/teal to bright yellow (highest
    count ~120). The color bar on the right shows the "Count" legend. Title is correctly
    formatted as "hexbin-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axis labels are
    "X Coordinate" and "Y Coordinate". The 16:9 aspect ratio is properly implemented.'

        comment: Uses lets-plot's ggplot2-style grammar with geom_hex, scale_fill_viridis,
          and theme customization; could leverage more lets-plot specific features
          like tooltips or interactivity in the HTML output
