review:
  strengths:
  - Effective color coding distinguishes increasing (blue) vs decreasing (orange-red)
    products clearly
  - Clean KISS code structure with good organization separating increasing/decreasing
    products
  - Colorblind-safe color palette choice
  - Proper use of pygal Line chart to simulate slope chart behavior
  - Good canvas utilization with 4800x2700 dimensions and appropriate font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Right-side endpoint labels are truncated showing only Product without the full
    identifier
  - Legend is overcrowded with 10 individual entries when 2 grouped entries would
    suffice
  - Some label overlap on left side where values are close together (68-72 range)
