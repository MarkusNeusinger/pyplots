review:
  strengths:
  - Clean donut chart visualization with appropriate inner radius
  - Realistic portfolio data with hierarchical structure (categories with sub-holdings)
  - Proper use of pygal Style class for customization
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Tooltips contain detailed breakdown information for interactivity
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement is unbalanced - entries are split with Fixed Income far from
    other entries
  - Sub-holding breakdown is only available via tooltips, not visible in static PNG
  - Legend text size could be larger relative to the canvas size
  - No percentage labels directly on the pie slices for quick reference
  image_description: The plot displays a donut chart (pie chart with inner radius
    cutout) showing investment portfolio allocation across three asset classes. The
    chart uses a blue color for Equities (55%), yellow/gold for Fixed Income (28%),
    and orange/peach for Alternatives (17%). The title "pie-portfolio-interactive
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in a monospace font. The legend
    is positioned at the bottom left of the canvas, showing colored squares with category
    names and their percentages. The donut chart is well-sized and centered on a white
    background, utilizing good canvas space with the chart filling approximately 60%
    of the vertical space. The inner radius creates a clean donut appearance. The
    three segments are clearly distinguishable with good color contrast between them.
