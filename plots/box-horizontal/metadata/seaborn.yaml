review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing diverse distributions with outliers, tight spreads,
    and wide spreads
  - Categories correctly sorted by median for easier comparison (as suggested in spec)
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clean alternating color palette that aids visual distinction between categories
  - All text sizes optimized for the 4800×2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Color alternation (blue/yellow) is decorative rather than conveying meaning -
    a single color or sequential palette might be cleaner
  - Could use sns.set_context() for more consistent seaborn styling
