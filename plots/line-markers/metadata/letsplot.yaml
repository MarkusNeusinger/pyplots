review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for readability at target resolution (28pt title, 22pt axes,
    18pt ticks)
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar with proper layering of geom_line and geom_point
  - Realistic business scenario with quarterly product performance showing distinct
    trends
  - Good color contrast between the three product lines
  - Markers are clearly visible against the lines with appropriate alpha (0.9)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha 0.5 is too prominent - should be 0.2-0.4 for subtlety
  - Could use different marker shapes for multiple series as suggested in the spec
    notes
  image_description: The plot displays three product lines (Product A, B, C) tracked
    over 12 quarters showing revenue in Million USD. Product A (blue) shows strong
    upward growth from ~47 to ~78 million. Product B (yellow/gold) starts highest
    at ~61 million but trends downward to ~48 million. Product C (red) starts lowest
    at ~34 million and grows steadily to ~57 million. Each data point has a circular
    marker. The title follows the correct format "line-markers · lets-plot · pyplots.ai".
    Legend is positioned on the right. Grid lines are subtle gray. The layout is clean
    with good use of space.
