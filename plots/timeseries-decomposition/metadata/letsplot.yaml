review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of gggrid() to create vertically stacked decomposition panels
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette with distinct colors for each component
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for actual decomposition
  - Good realistic temperature scenario with clear seasonal patterns
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Properly handles NaN values from decomposition by using dropna()
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle and barely visible - could increase alpha for better
    readability
  - File handling requires moving files from lets-plot-images subdirectory (workaround
    needed)
  image_description: The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked panels showing monthly temperature data over 5 years (2019-2024). The
    **Original Series** (blue line) shows temperature fluctuations ranging from ~7°C
    to ~30°C with clear seasonal patterns. The **Trend** component (red line) shows
    a gradual warming from ~15°C to ~18°C. The **Seasonal** component (green line)
    displays a repeating annual cycle oscillating between approximately -11°C and
    +11°C. The **Residual** (purple line) shows random noise centered around 0, ranging
    from about -2°C to +3°C. All panels share a common x-axis showing dates (Jul,
    Oct, Jan, Apr pattern), with the main title "timeseries-decomposition · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. Each panel has "Temperature (°C)" on the y-axis and
    clear component labels. Light grid lines aid readability.
