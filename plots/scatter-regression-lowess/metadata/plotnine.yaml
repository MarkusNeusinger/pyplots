review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of agricultural context (temperature vs crop yield) that naturally
    demonstrates non-linear LOWESS behavior
  - Perfect color contrast between blue scatter points and yellow LOWESS curve
  - Clean, minimal theme with appropriate text sizing for 4800×2700 resolution
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Title format exactly matches specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - The LOWESS curve extends slightly below y=0 at the left edge, which is visually
    awkward for a yield that should be positive
  - The span parameter in geom_smooth may not be correctly controlling the LOWESS
    bandwidth
