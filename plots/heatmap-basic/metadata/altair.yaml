review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative API with layer composition (heatmap + text)
    for annotations
  - Adaptive text color via alt.when().then().otherwise() conditional encoding — a
    distinctive Altair 5.x+ feature
  - Realistic weather correlation data with injected correlations producing meaningful
    patterns
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate complexity
  - White cell borders add visual polish and separation
  - Interactive tooltips and HTML export leverage Altair interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme redblue is not ideal for colorblind accessibility — consider switching
    to blueorange or a perceptually-uniform diverging scheme
  - Title prepends Weather Metrics Correlation before the required format — should
    be exactly heatmap-basic · altair · pyplots.ai
  - Layout has some wasted space especially around the colorbar area on the right
    side
  - No explicit visual emphasis or storytelling beyond the diverging color — strongest
    correlations could be highlighted more prominently
  - Axis titles are set to None; even for a correlation matrix a subtle axis label
    or subtitle could provide context
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 correlation heatmap of weather metrics
    (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Visibility, Cloud Cover, Precipitation,
    UV Index). A diverging blue-white-red color scheme is used, centered at zero —
    dark blue represents strong positive correlations (e.g., diagonal = 1.00) and
    dark red represents strong negative correlations (e.g., Visibility vs Cloud Cover
    = -0.73). Each cell contains a bold numeric annotation showing the correlation
    coefficient to two decimal places. Text color adapts — white on saturated cells,
    dark gray on lighter cells. X-axis labels appear at the top, Y-axis labels on
    the left. White borders separate cells cleanly. A vertical colorbar on the right
    labeled "Correlation" ranges from -1.0 to 1.0. The title reads "Weather Metrics
    Correlation · heatmap-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top-left. The overall
    layout is square (3600x3600 px).
