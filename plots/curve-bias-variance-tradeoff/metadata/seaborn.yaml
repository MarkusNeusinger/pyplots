review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the bias-variance tradeoff concept
  - 'All spec requirements implemented: 4 curves, optimal point, shaded zones, formula,
    direct annotations'
  - Clean color scheme with good accessibility (blue, yellow, gray, red distinguishable)
  - Professional layout with well-positioned zone labels and curve annotations
  - Title follows exact format specification
  - Comprehensive legend and formula box
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn used primarily for styling (set_context) rather than core plotting functions
    - actual plotting done via matplotlib ax.plot()
  - Minor overlap potential between formula box and legend in top-right area
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays four curves representing the bias-variance tradeoff concept:

    - Bias² (blue solid line): Decreases from ~1.9 at low complexity to ~0.4 at high complexity
    - Variance (yellow/gold solid line): Increases from near 0 at low complexity to ~1.6 at high complexity
    - Irreducible Error (gray dashed line): Constant horizontal line at 0.3
    - Total Error (red solid line): U-shaped curve showing the sum of all components, minimum around medium complexity

    The plot includes:
    - Blue-tinted "Underfitting (High Bias)" zone on the left side of the optimal point
    - Yellow-tinted "Overfitting (High Variance)" zone on the right side of the optimal point
    - Green vertical dotted line and green circular marker indicating the optimal complexity point
    - Green arrow annotation pointing to "Optimal Complexity" label
    - Direct curve labels (Bias², Variance, Total Error, Irreducible Error) placed near each respective curve
    - Formula box in top-right corner: "Error = Bias² + Variance + ε"
    - Legend at top center with all four components shown with matching colors and line styles
    - X-axis labeled "Model Complexity" with Low/Medium/High categorical tick labels
    - Y-axis labeled "Prediction Error" with numeric values ranging from 0.0 to 3.5
    - Title: "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    - Subtle gray grid lines with alpha=0.3 for reference
