review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clean, professional appearance
  - Proper implementation of semi-circular gauge with three distinct color zones
  - Clear needle indicator with triangular shape and center hub
  - Prominent value display below gauge (48pt bold)
  - Correct title format following pyplots conventions
  - Well-proportioned layout utilizing canvas space effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure with deterministic data
  weaknesses:
  - Color zones use red-green which may be challenging for colorblind users; consider
    using blue/orange/green or adding patterns
  - Could use Bokeh annular_wedge glyph for simpler arc rendering instead of manual
    polygon patches
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart with three color
    zones: red (0-30), yellow (30-70), and green (70-100). The gauge has a dark blue
    needle pointing to approximately 72, which falls in the green zone. A center hub
    circle anchors the needle. Tick marks appear at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 with corresponding
    numeric labels positioned outside the arc. The current value "72" is prominently
    displayed in bold blue text below the gauge center. The title "gauge-basic · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The overall layout is clean with good use of
    whitespace and a balanced composition on a white background.'

        comment: Uses Bokeh's figure, patch, circle, line, and Label correctly. Creates
          custom geometry via patch polygons. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features
          like hover tooltips or annular_wedge for cleaner arc rendering.
  verdict: APPROVED
