review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized markers and line thickness for the high-resolution
    output
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color scheme using Python signature blue and yellow
  - Realistic and engaging temperature data scenario that demonstrates the plot type
    effectively
  - Clean title format following spec requirements exactly
  - Two distinct marker shapes (circle vs diamond) as recommended by the specification
  - Interactive HTML version also saved alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid lines could be more subtle (current gridLineWidth: 1 could be reduced or
    alpha lowered)'
  - The chart height in the rendered image (2561px) does not match the specified 2700px,
    suggesting potential cropping or rendering issue
