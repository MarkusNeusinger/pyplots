review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with distinct, well-chosen colors
  - Clear demonstration of strip plot concept with meaningful jitter
  - Mean markers provide useful reference points for comparison
  - Realistic educational data context (test scores by subject)
  - Bimodal distributions in Math and Literature showcase data variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  - Interactive HTML export alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (should be "Test Score (%)" or similar)
  - Some point overlap in dense regions could benefit from slightly smaller markers
    or more transparency
  - Legend positioned far from the data in top-right corner
