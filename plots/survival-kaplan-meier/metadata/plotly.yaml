review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Kaplan-Meier algorithm with Greenwood formula
    for confidence intervals
  - Professional step-function visualization with properly constructed step coordinates
  - Clear visual distinction between treatment groups with accessible color scheme
  - Median survival annotation provides valuable clinical context
  - Interactive hover tooltips enhance data exploration
  - Produces both PNG and HTML output leveraging Plotly interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be cleaner by combining censored markers description or using a single
    legend entry style
  - Code complexity is higher than typical KISS style due to manual KM calculation
    (though necessary without lifelines library)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with two
    treatment groups. Treatment A (Experimental) is shown in blue (#306998) and Treatment
    B (Standard Care) in yellow/gold (#FFD43B). Both curves start at 100% survival
    probability at time 0 and decrease in characteristic step-function pattern over
    time (0-50 months). The blue Treatment A curve shows better survival, ending around
    37% at ~36 months, while the yellow Treatment B curve drops more steeply, reaching
    ~15% at similar timepoints. Both curves have shaded confidence interval bands
    - blue-tinted for A and yellow-tinted for B. Censored observations are marked
    as vertical tick marks on/near the curves. The legend is positioned in the upper
    right corner with clear labels. A median survival annotation box in the lower
    left shows Treatment A: 22.4 months and Treatment B: 16.6 months. The title follows
    the correct format. Axis labels show "Time (months)" and "Survival Probability"
    with percentage formatting (0%-100%).'
