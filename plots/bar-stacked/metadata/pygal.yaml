review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of value labels displayed within each segment for precise reading
  - Clean, realistic business scenario with quarterly revenue data
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good color palette with distinguishable colors for all four categories
  - Well-configured custom style with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are minimal (only one visible at y=50); adding more y-axis guides would
    improve readability
  - Could use pygal's tooltips or other interactive features more prominently
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    by product category. Four bars (Q1-Q4) are shown on the x-axis with "Revenue (Million
    USD)" on the y-axis ranging from 0 to ~55. Each bar consists of four stacked segments
    in distinct colors: Software (steel blue, bottom), Hardware (golden yellow), Services
    (teal/cyan), and Cloud (coral/salmon, top). Value labels (e.g., 12.5, 8.3, 5.2,
    3.1) are displayed within each segment. The title "bar-stacked · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend at the bottom identifies all four categories. The
    chart demonstrates clear quarterly growth with Q4 showing the highest cumulative
    revenue (~56M). A subtle dotted grid line is visible at y=50.'

        comment: Uses pygal's custom Style, StackedBar chart type, print_values feature,
          and legend_at_bottom. Good use of pygal-specific configuration but nothing
          highly distinctive.
  verdict: APPROVED
