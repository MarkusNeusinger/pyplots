quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom grid layout with CSS Grid demonstrating colspan/rowspan effectively
  - Dashboard-style visualization with a large main chart (2x2) and 4 detail views
    (1x1 each)
  - Perfect colorblind-safe palette with 5 distinct colors
  - All text is highly legible with appropriately sized fonts for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic financial data scenario with coherent relationships between charts
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text sizes are disproportionately small compared to the chart titles and
    should be increased for better readability
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library API (Chart, HighchartsOptions
    classes) as recommended in the library guidelines; instead manually constructs
    JavaScript configurations
  image_description: "The plot displays a financial dashboard with a custom grid layout\
    \ containing 5 charts. The main chart (spanning 2 columns on the left) shows \"\
    Stock Price (90 Days)\" as a blue line chart with markers, displaying price values\
    \ from ~$123 to $161 over 90 trading days. The Y-axis shows \"Price ($)\" and\
    \ X-axis shows \"Trading Day\". On the right side, there are 4 smaller detail\
    \ charts arranged in a 2x2 grid:\n- Top-right 1: \"Trading Volume\" bar chart\
    \ in yellow showing volume in millions\n- Top-right 2: \"Returns Distribution\"\
    \ histogram in purple showing daily return percentages  \n- Bottom-right 1: \"\
    Risk vs Return by Sector\" scatter plot in cyan with labeled data points for Tech,\
    \ Health, Finance, Energy, and Consumer sectors\n- Bottom-right 2: \"20-Day Moving\
    \ Average\" line chart in brown showing smoothed price data\n\nThe dashboard title\
    \ \"subplot-grid-custom · highcharts · pyplots.ai\" appears at the top. All charts\
    \ have subtle gray gridlines, proper axis labels with units, and legends. The\
    \ color palette uses blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), purple (#9467BD), cyan\
    \ (#17BECF), and brown (#8C564B) - a colorblind-safe combination."

        comment: While the implementation works, it uses raw JavaScript configuration
          objects instead of the highcharts-core Python library. The code constructs
          Highcharts charts directly via JavaScript literals embedded in HTML rather
          than using the Chart class with HighchartsOptions as demonstrated in the
          library guidelines.
  verdict: APPROVED
