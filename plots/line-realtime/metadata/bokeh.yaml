review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the fade/gradient effect showing data recency through
    both alpha and marker size
  - Clear visual indication of scrolling direction with arrow and explanatory text
  - Prominent highlighting of current value with contrasting yellow marker and label
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with believable spike patterns
  - Clean title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of Bokeh annotations (Arrow, Label, VeeHead)
  weaknesses:
  - No legend is present (minor issue for single-series plot)
  - Data stays mostly in the 25-60% range; showing occasional values near 0% or 90%+
    would demonstrate the full scale
  - Could utilize Bokeh HoverTool for interactive HTML output to show values on hover
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitor as a line chart.
    The X-axis shows time (from 14:09:32 to 14:09:37 on Dec 31, 2025) with "Time"
    label. The Y-axis shows "CPU Usage (%)" ranging from 0-100. The line is rendered
    in Python blue (#306998) with a gradient fade effect - older data on the left
    appears more transparent with smaller markers, while recent data on the right
    is fully opaque with larger markers. Two CPU usage spikes are visible (~55% and
    ~58%). The latest data point is highlighted with a yellow marker and labeled "Current:
    34.2%". An arrow pointing left with "Older data scrolls off" text indicates the
    scrolling direction. The title "CPU Usage Monitor · line-realtime · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears in blue at the top. Background is light gray with subtle dashed grid lines.'
