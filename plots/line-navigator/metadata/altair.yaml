review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the navigator pattern using Altair declarative grammar
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic sensor data with trend, seasonality, and noise components
  - Proper use of interval selection linked between charts
  - Visual consistency between main chart and navigator (same line color)
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines on either chart would help with value reading
  - The selection highlight starts covering the full range - would be more demonstrative
    with a partial selection
  - Could benefit from .interactive() on main chart for additional zoom/pan capability
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a line chart with a mini navigator pane, implementing the specification for a line-navigator visualization. The main chart (top) shows daily sensor temperature readings from early 2022 to late 2024, rendered as a blue line (#306998) against a white background. Values range from approximately 10°C to 45°C, showing clear yearly seasonal patterns (higher in summer, lower in winter) with an overall upward trend. The Y-axis is labeled "Sensor Reading (°C)" and the X-axis shows "Date" with year and month labels. The title "line-navigator · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.

    Below the main chart is a smaller navigator pane (approximately 15% of main chart height) displaying the entire 3-year dataset at reduced scale. A yellow/gold highlighted area (#FFD43B with 30% opacity) shows the currently selected range, which appears to cover the full extent. Both charts use consistent blue line styling. The X-axis ticks show years and months (2022, 2023, 2024 with monthly markers).
