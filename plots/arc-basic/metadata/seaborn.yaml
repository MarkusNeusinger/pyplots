review:
  strengths:
  - Clean arc diagram visualization with height proportional to connection distance
  - Good use of semi-transparency for overlapping arcs
  - Well-chosen color scheme (Python blue and gold) that is colorblind-safe
  - Realistic data context (character interactions) that demonstrates the plot type
    well
  - Arc thickness correctly varies with edge weight
  weaknesses:
  - The Y-axis label and numeric tick labels are inappropriate for this abstract visualization
    type; arc diagrams should have axes hidden
  - Legend for interaction strength appears in code but is not visible in the rendered
    image
  - Only 8 nodes when spec recommends 10-50 for typical readability demonstrations
