review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Point and Figure algorithm implementation with proper 3-box reversal
    logic
  - Clean color scheme with green X's and red O's providing clear visual distinction
  - Good use of Plotly's text mode to render X and O symbols
  - Helpful parameter annotation showing box size and reversal settings
  - Proper hover tooltips showing column, price, and direction
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays small red A characters instead of X/O symbols (legend uses text
    mode which renders differently)
  - Could add support/resistance trend lines as mentioned in specification
  - Red-green color scheme, while traditional for P&F charts, is not colorblind-friendly
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Point and Figure chart with columns of green
    X''s (rising prices) and red O''s (falling prices) distributed across approximately
    18 columns. The price range spans from about $80 to $148 on the Y-axis, with the
    X-axis labeled "Column (Reversal)" ranging from 0 to about 17. The title correctly
    shows "point-and-figure-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top center. A legend
    in the upper right shows "X (Rising)" in green and "O (Falling)" in red. The chart
    demonstrates clear trend patterns with alternating bullish and bearish columns.
    An annotation at the bottom shows "Box Size: $2 | Reversal: 3 boxes". The background
    is white with subtle gray gridlines.'

        comment: Uses Plotly's text mode for scatter, hover tooltips with hovertemplate,
          and HTML export. However, doesn't leverage more distinctive Plotly features
          like interactive callbacks or animations
