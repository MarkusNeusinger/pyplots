review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with theoretical PDF overlay
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good color choices with blue histogram and contrasting yellow PDF line
  - Proper density normalization (area under histogram = 1)
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate sample size (500)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text is small (16pt) and difficult to read at full resolution; should be
    larger (e.g., 20pt)
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities like hover tooltips to show bin
    values
  - Minor empty space on the right side of the plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density histogram of test scores with blue
    histogram bars (color #306998) showing the empirical distribution. The bars have
    white borders and slight transparency (alpha 0.7). A yellow/gold smooth curve
    (Normal PDF with μ=75, σ=12) overlays the histogram. The title "histogram-density
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score"
    (ranging from ~40 to ~120), and the y-axis is labeled "Density (Probability per
    Unit)" (ranging from 0 to ~0.035). A legend in the top-left shows "Empirical Distribution"
    and "Normal PDF (μ=75, σ=12)". The grid is subtle with dashed lines. The plot
    uses a 16:9 landscape format at 4800×2700 pixels.'
