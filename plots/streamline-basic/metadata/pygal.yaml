review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround for pygal lack of native streamline support using XY connected
    lines
  - Good visual representation of vortex flow with distinct colored orbital groups
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of custom Style for font sizing and colors
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels in rendered image appear truncated compared to code-defined labels
  - The blue color tones (Near-Inner and Middle) are somewhat similar and could be
    more distinct
  - Streamlines only show closed circular orbits - more varied flow features would
    better demonstrate streamline capabilities
  - Random seed is set but not actually needed since the vortex field is mathematically
    deterministic
