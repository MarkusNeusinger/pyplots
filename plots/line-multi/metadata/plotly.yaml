review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with thick lines (width=4), large markers (size=12),
    and distinct marker symbols (circle, square, diamond, triangle)
  - Perfect colorblind-safe palette using Python Blue (#306998), Yellow (#FFD43B),
    Green (#2CA02C), and Purple (#9467BD)
  - Varied line styles (solid, solid, dash, dot) provide additional visual differentiation
    beyond color
  - Realistic business scenario with 4 product lines showing diverse trend patterns
    (growth, seasonal, stable, decline)
  - Clean legend placement with semi-transparent background that does not obscure
    data
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive strengths like custom hover templates or
    range sliders that would enhance the multi-line comparison experience
  - 'Minor inconsistency: y-axis label says Thousands of Units but actual values are
    in the 50-230 range'
