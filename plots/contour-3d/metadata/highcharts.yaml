review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 3D contour visualization using Highcharts 3D capabilities
  - Custom marching squares algorithm for contour extraction is well-implemented
  - Dual output (PNG + interactive HTML) provides flexibility
  - Colorbar with contour level indicators is a nice touch
  - Good use of viridis-like colormap for accessibility
  - Contour projection on base plane enhances understanding
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure includes functions (get_color, extract_contour_paths) which deviates
    from KISS principle
  - Dense point cloud in some areas creates slight visual clutter
  - Subtitle extends beyond the standard title format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3D contour visualization with a surface
    rendered as a wireframe mesh of colored points and lines. The surface shows multiple
    Gaussian peaks and a valley, with the height (Z) represented both spatially and
    through a viridis-like color gradient (dark purple for low values ~-0.42, through
    teal, to yellow for high values ~1.17). White contour lines with black shadows
    are drawn on the surface at regular height intervals. Dashed colored contour projections
    appear on the base plane (at the bottom). The title reads "contour-3d · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Surface with Contour Lines and Base Projections".
    Axes are labeled: "X Position (units)", "Z Height (amplitude)" for the vertical
    axis, and "Y Position (units)" for depth. A colorbar on the right shows the Z
    Height scale with tick marks indicating contour levels.'
