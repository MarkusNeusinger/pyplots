review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of frequency spectrum with clear identification of fundamental
    (440 Hz) and harmonic peaks (880, 1320 Hz)
  - Proper use of AreaSplineSeries with gradient fill for aesthetic appeal
  - Correct dB scale for amplitude representation as recommended in spec
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (#306998 blue)
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) provides both static and interactive versions
  - Comprehensive subtitle explaining the signal composition
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are dense with many values displayed; could use larger tick
    intervals for cleaner appearance
  - Legend font size could be larger relative to other text elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a frequency spectrum with an areaspline chart
    showing signal amplitude (dB) across a frequency range of 0-2000 Hz. The chart
    has a white background with a light blue filled area under the curve. Three prominent
    peaks are clearly visible at approximately 440 Hz (tallest peak at ~-5 dB), 880
    Hz (second peak at ~-12 dB), and 1320 Hz (third peak at ~-17 dB), matching the
    specified harmonics in the subtitle. The baseline noise floor fluctuates around
    -55 to -65 dB. The title reads "spectrum-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold
    at the top, with a subtitle "Audio Signal Analysis: 440 Hz Fundamental + Harmonics".
    The Y-axis shows "Amplitude (dB)" and the X-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)". A legend
    labeled "Power Spectrum" appears in the top-right corner. Grid lines are subtle
    and appropriately transparent.'

          The peaks are clearly distinguishable from the noise floor. Gradient fill
          enhances visibility.
