review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color palette that is colorblind-accessible (blue, yellow, purple, green)
  - Clean layout with proper margins and well-positioned legend
  - Good use of hovertemplate for interactive exploration in HTML output
  - White marker borders provide visual distinction for overlapping points
  - Realistic business context (regional product performance)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is perhaps too subtle; 0.2-0.3 would provide better reference
    without being distracting
  - Legend border is minimal but could be removed entirely for cleaner look
  - Some sales growth values exceed 100% which is mathematically possible but unusual
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical scatter plot showing the relationship
    between Marketing Investment (%) on the X-axis and Sales Growth (%) on the Y-axis.
    Four distinct regions are represented: North (blue/steel blue), South (yellow/gold),
    West (purple/violet), and East (green/teal). Each region forms a visually distinguishable
    cluster of approximately 40 data points. The title "scatter-categorical · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The legend is positioned on the right side
    with a "Region" header and shows all four categories. Grid lines are subtle (light
    gray), and the background is clean white. Markers have slight transparency (0.7)
    with white borders, making overlapping points still distinguishable.'

        comment: Markers are appropriately sized (14px) with good alpha (0.7) for

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with custom hovertemplate for interactivity (visible
          in HTML output), white marker borders. Could leverage more plotly-specific
          features like animations or more advanced hover info
  verdict: APPROVED
