review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic regional patterns (Europe higher GDP,
    Africa lower)
  - Clean implementation using pygal XY chart with proper node size customization
    via node dict
  - Good use of custom Style for visual consistency
  - Proper semi-transparency (opacity=0.6) for overlapping bubbles
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Both axis labels include appropriate units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing size legend to indicate what bubble sizes represent (spec requirement)
  - Some smaller bubbles are difficult to see at lower population values
  - Library-specific font sizes are quite large but rendering appears smaller than
    expected
