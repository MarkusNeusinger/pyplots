review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn heatmap for QR code matrix visualization
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper quiet zone and high contrast for scanability
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Square figure format appropriate for QR codes
  - Spines correctly removed for clean appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size could be slightly larger for 3600x3600 canvas
  - Using seaborn heatmap for binary data is creative but not leveraging seaborn statistical
    visualization strengths
  image_description: The plot displays a QR code encoding "https://pyplots.ai" rendered
    using seaborn's heatmap function. The QR code shows the classic black-on-white
    matrix pattern with three finder patterns (large squares) in the top-left, top-right,
    and bottom-left corners. The code includes a proper quiet zone (white border)
    around the matrix. The title "qrcode-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in black text. The overall layout is square format with the QR code well-centered
    and filling most of the canvas. The high contrast black and white color scheme
    ensures maximum scanability.
