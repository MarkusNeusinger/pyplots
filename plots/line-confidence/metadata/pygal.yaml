review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with proper KISS format and reproducible seed
  - Realistic data scenario (user growth prediction with widening uncertainty over
    time)
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good text legibility and no overlapping elements
  - Creative attempt to simulate confidence band using fill layering
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval band is completely invisible - the white masking layer technique
    has failed
  - Legend claims 95% Confidence Interval exists but the band does not render
  - The core specification requirement (shaded confidence band) is not met
  - 'Consider using a different approach: pygal Line chart with range_fill or drawing
    two filled areas that create a visible band effect'
  - Y-axis should extend to show the actual confidence bounds
