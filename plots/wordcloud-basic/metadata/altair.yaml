review:
  strengths:
  - Creative spiral positioning algorithm for word placement without overlaps
  - Excellent use of Python-themed color palette with good contrast
  - Clear title following the required format
  - Well-balanced layout with words filling the canvas appropriately
  - Good variation in font sizes reflecting frequency differences
  weaknesses:
  - Some smaller words (GraphQL, Terraform, AWS) are slightly hard to read due to
    light colors on white background
  - Word distribution could be more compact - there is empty space at the bottom of
    the canvas
