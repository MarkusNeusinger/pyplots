review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for clean data binding and annotations
  - Proper categorical x-axis configuration with x_range parameter
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (customer satisfaction survey) that demonstrates
    the count plot purpose
  - Data is automatically counted and sorted by frequency as recommended in spec
  - Both static (PNG) and interactive (HTML) outputs generated
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be slightly more subtle (alpha 0.3 is at the upper end of recommended
    0.2-0.4 range)
