review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data generation with trend, weekly cyclical pattern, and noise
  - Clean ggplot2-style code using geom_area and geom_line combination
  - Proper export with scale=3 for high resolution (4800x2700 px)
  - Semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.4) for good readability as spec recommends
  - Saves both PNG and HTML for interactive version
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 0 creating large empty space below data (consider starting from
    minimum value or using scale_y_continuous with limits)
  - Uses numeric day_num instead of actual dates; could use scale_x_datetime for proper
    date axis formatting
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (add alpha to panel_grid)
