review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Highstock-specific features (range selector, navigator,
    scrollbar)
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required interactive features
  - Realistic stock price data with meaningful patterns (trend, peak, correction)
  - Clean gradient fill effect from blue to transparent
  - Proper use of Highstock library (highstock.js) for stock chart functionality
  - Both PNG and standalone HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels are somewhat cramped with repetitive month names
  - Code uses raw JSON dict for Highcharts options instead of highcharts-core Python
    classes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock area chart with a blue filled area
    and gradient effect. The chart shows approximately one year of stock price data
    (Jan 2025 - Nov 2025) with prices ranging from ~$146 to ~$234 USD. The price action
    shows an initial uptrend from ~$150 to peak around ~$230 in May 2025, followed
    by a decline to ~$150 by November. The chart includes: (1) Range selector buttons
    at top-left (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) with YTD selected, (2) Date input fields
    at top-right showing "Jan 1, 2025 - Nov 17, 2025", (3) A navigator/mini-chart
    at the bottom showing the full data range with draggable selection handles, (4)
    Proper title "area-stock-range · highcharts · pyplots.ai" and subtitle "Stock
    Price with Interactive Range Selector". The fill color uses a semi-transparent
    blue (#306998) gradient from top to bottom. Grid lines are subtle. Y-axis shows
    prices in USD with dollar signs, X-axis shows dates in "Mon YYYY" format.'
