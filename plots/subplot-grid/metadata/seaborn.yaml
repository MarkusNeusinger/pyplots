review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 2x2 grid layout with four distinct plot types (line, bar, histogram,
    scatter) demonstrating subplot versatility
  - Financial dashboard scenario with realistic stock data showing price trends, volume,
    returns distribution, and price-volume relationships
  - Strong seaborn usage with lineplot, histplot, and scatterplot functions plus matplotlib
    integration for hybrid approach
  - Good color coding with blue/yellow scheme for positive/negative returns and RdBu
    diverging palette for scatter plot
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed and logical data flow
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels in top-left subplot could use rotation or fewer ticks for better
    readability
  - Volume bar chart uses matplotlib ax.bar instead of seaborn barplot - could leverage
    more seaborn-native functions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid financial dashboard with the main
    title "subplot-grid · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. **Top-left**: A line chart
    showing "Stock Price" over time from January to May 2024, with price ranging from
    ~$85 to ~$110, rendered in blue (#306998). The x-axis shows dates with some rotation,
    y-axis labeled "Price ($)". **Top-right**: A bar chart showing "Trading Volume"
    with alternating blue and yellow bars (representing positive/negative return days),
    x-axis showing "Trading Day" (0-100), y-axis "Volume (Millions)" (0-10). **Bottom-left**:
    A histogram showing "Daily Returns Distribution" with blue bars, a yellow dashed
    vertical line at zero labeled "Zero Return", x-axis "Daily Return (%)" ranging
    from -4 to 4, y-axis "Frequency" (0-11). **Bottom-right**: A scatter plot showing
    "Price vs Volume" with points colored using a RdBu (red-blue) diverging colormap
    based on daily return, point sizes varying by volume, with a colorbar indicating
    "Daily Return (%)" from -4 to +2. All subplots have subtle grid lines and clear
    axis labels with units.'
