review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of circular rotation pattern (u=-y, v=x) as suggested
    in spec
  - Perfect use of viridis colormap to encode vector magnitude, adding meaningful
    insight
  - Well-tuned arrow parameters (scale=25, width=0.008) for clear visibility without
    overlap
  - Correct aspect ratio (set_aspect=equal) for proper vector representation
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though acceptable for dimensionless mathematical coordinates)
