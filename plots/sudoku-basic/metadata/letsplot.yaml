quality_score: 93
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with thick/thin grid lines clearly distinguishing 3x3
    boxes from individual cells
  - Clean monochrome design perfectly matches spec requirement for print-friendly
    output
  - Numbers are bold, large, and well-centered in cells for easy readability
  - Square aspect ratio (1:1) is ideal for Sudoku grid presentation
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with geom_segment for lines and geom_text
    for numbers
  weaknesses:
  - Pandas import is unnecessary; simple Python lists/dicts would suffice and reduce
    dependencies
