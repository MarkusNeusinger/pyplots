review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex ternary density plot using pure SVG generation
  - Viridis colormap correctly implemented for perceptual uniformity and colorblind
    safety
  - Three distinct density clusters effectively demonstrate the KDE functionality
  - Contour lines at multiple levels (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) for easier interpretation
  - Realistic sediment composition scenario with appropriate geological context
  - Grid lines properly show percentage divisions at 20/40/60/80%
  - Clean coordinate transformation from ternary to Cartesian space
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (ternary_to_cartesian, gaussian_kde_numpy, get_viridis_color)
    instead of inline code per KISS principle
  - Outputs both plot.html and plot.png (only PNG required)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density diagram within an equilateral
    triangle representing sand/silt/clay sediment composition. Three distinct density
    clusters are visible using the viridis colormap: (1) a high-density yellow-green
    cluster in the bottom-left corner near SAND vertex representing sandy sediments,
    (2) a second cluster in the bottom-right near SILT vertex for silty sediments,
    and (3) a smaller cluster toward the top-right representing clay-rich sediments.
    The triangle has dashed grid lines at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% intervals. Vertices are
    clearly labeled with "SAND", "SILT", and "CLAY" in bold. Percentage labels appear
    along all three edges. A colorbar on the right shows density scale from "Low"
    (purple) to "High" (yellow). The title reads "Sediment Composition Distribution"
    with subtitle "ternary-density · pygal · pyplots.ai". White circular contour markers
    outline the density regions at various levels.'
