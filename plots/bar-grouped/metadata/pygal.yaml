review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Style class for comprehensive visual customization
  - Clean data structure with meaningful business context (quarterly revenue by product)
  - Value labels with currency formatting ($X.XM) enhance readability
  - Good color palette that is both visually appealing and accessible
  - Proper dual output (PNG and HTML) leveraging pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left could be moved to a less intrusive position
  - Font sizes deviate from library style guide recommendations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    data for three product lines. Four quarters (Q1-Q4) are shown on the x-axis with
    three bars per quarter representing Software (blue #306998), Hardware (yellow
    #FFD43B), and Services (coral/pink #FF6B6B). The y-axis shows Revenue in millions
    of dollars ranging from $0.0M to $6.0M. Each bar has a value label on top (e.g.,
    $4.2M, $5.1M, $6.3M). The legend is positioned in the top-left corner. The title
    "bar-grouped · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The background is white
    with subtle horizontal grid lines, and the overall layout is clean and well-proportioned.'

        comment: Title, axis labels, and value labels are all clearly readable. Font
          sizes are well-scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas.

        comment: Blue, yellow, and coral provide excellent contrast and are colorblind-friendly
          (no red-green only distinction).

        max: 5
        passed: true
        comment: Good canvas utilization; plot fills majority of space. Legend placement
          in top-left is functional but slightly crowds the first data point area.

        score: 0
        max: 2

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate. However, legend position overlaps
          with the plot area margin and could be better placed.

        comment: Uses pygal's Style customization, print_values with custom formatter,
          SVG/PNG dual output. Could leverage more advanced features like tooltips
          configuration or animation settings.
