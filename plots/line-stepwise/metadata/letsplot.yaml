review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step line visualization with clear horizontal-then-vertical transitions
    using direction=hv
  - Points overlay on steps helps identify exact data points at each hour
  - Good color scheme with Python-inspired blue and yellow that is colorblind accessible
  - Realistic server response time monitoring scenario that demonstrates discrete
    state changes
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line color could be slightly more subtle
  - Points at every hour are slightly redundant - could highlight only the change
    points
  - Data pattern is somewhat predictable with changes only at specific scheduled hours
