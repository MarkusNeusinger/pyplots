review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent grid layout organizing faces by species with clear row and column labels
  - Outstanding feature mapping legend explaining what each facial feature represents
  - Good use of colorblind-friendly palette (blue, yellow, green) to distinguish species
  - Proper data normalization (0-1) before mapping to facial features
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Plotly interactivity
  - All facial features (face shape, eyes, pupils, eyebrows, nose, mouth) are clearly
    rendered
  - Title follows correct format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  weaknesses:
  - Within-species facial variation is subtle, especially for Setosa - faces look
    very similar within each row making it hard to see individual differences
  - Title includes Iris Dataset prefix which deviates slightly from the pure spec-id
    format
