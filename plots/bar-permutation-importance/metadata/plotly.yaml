review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear color gradient distinguishing importance
    levels
  - Error bars implemented correctly with appropriate styling (semi-transparent, proper
    width)
  - Clean professional appearance with white background and subtle grid
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output (good use of Plotly dual-output
    capability)
  - Data represents a realistic ML feature importance scenario with weather features
  - Proper handling of negative importance values with reference line at x=0
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include units or more context (e.g., Mean Decrease in R² Score)
  - Color gradient could use a more standard colormap name for clarity in code
  - Could add annotations for the top features to enhance information density
