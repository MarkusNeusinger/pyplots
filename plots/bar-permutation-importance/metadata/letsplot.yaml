review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly spaced bars
  - Color gradient from yellow to blue effectively emphasizes importance ranking
  - Error bars are clearly visible and informative with appropriate styling
  - Realistic credit/lending domain data that demonstrates the plot type well
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with theme_minimal and scale_fill_gradient
  weaknesses:
  - The vertical reference line at x=0 is not rendering correctly with coord_flip()
    - geom_vline with xintercept=0 creates a horizontal line instead of vertical after
    the coordinate flip
  - HTML output could leverage lets-plot interactivity features like tooltips
