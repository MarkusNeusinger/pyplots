review:
  strengths:
  - Effective 3-level hierarchy visualization with clear visual distinction between
    levels using opacity and color
  - Good use of colorblind-safe Python blue/yellow palette
  - Realistic organizational data with appropriate scale and meaningful labels
  - Proper title format and well-positioned legend
  - Tooltips implemented for interactive SVG exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use pygal built-in chart classes for plotting; manually constructs SVG
    which defeats the purpose of using pygal as the visualization library
  - Circle packing uses simple ring layout rather than more efficient space-filling
    algorithm mentioned in spec
  - Code structure is complex with loops and manual SVG element creation, not following
    KISS principle
