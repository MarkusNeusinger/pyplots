review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of rectangular phylogenetic tree using lets-plot grammar
    of graphics
  - Custom Newick parser handles complex nested structure correctly
  - Color-coded clades (great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys) add visual interest
  - Branch lengths accurately reflect evolutionary distances with proportional x-axis
    positioning
  - Clean tree layout with horizontal and vertical segments properly connected
  - Good use of theme_minimal with customized axis and grid settings
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the three clade color groups (blue/yellow/green)
  - No scale bar to indicate branch length units
