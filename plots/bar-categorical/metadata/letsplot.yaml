  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following ggplot2 grammar of graphics
  - Automatic count computation using geom_bar() without stat=identity
  - Well-sized text elements (24pt title, 20pt axis labels, 16pt tick text) following
    library guidelines
  - Good use of theme_minimal() with appropriate grid customization
  - Proper figure sizing (1600x900 with scale=3 for 4800x2700 output)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage lets-plot interactive features (tooltips, hover effects) that
    distinguish it from plotnine
  - Data context is generic; could use a more specific real-world scenario
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical bar chart showing fruit type
    frequency counts. Five vertical bars represent different fruits: Bananas (~40),
    Mangoes (~31), Grapes (~33), Oranges (~40), and Apples (~56). The bars are rendered
    in a muted blue color (#306998) with darker borders. The title "bar-categorical
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left in bold. The x-axis is labeled
    "Fruit Type" with category names below each bar, and the y-axis is labeled "Count"
    with tick marks from 0 to 55. The plot uses a minimal theme with horizontal grid
    lines only, and the overall layout is clean with good proportions.'
