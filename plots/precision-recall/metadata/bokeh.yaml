review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of stepped line style (mode="after") which accurately represents
    threshold-based PR curves
  - Clean comparison of two classifiers with distinct, colorblind-safe colors
  - Proper inclusion of baseline reference line showing random classifier performance
  - Average Precision scores displayed prominently in legend
  - Good font sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing optional iso-F1 curves mentioned in specification notes (would enhance
    the visualization)
  - Could add hover tooltips to show precision/recall values at specific points (Bokeh
    strength)
