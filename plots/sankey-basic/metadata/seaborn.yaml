review:
  strengths:
  - The energy flow scenario (Coal, Gas, Nuclear to Residential, Commercial, Industrial)
    is realistic and appropriate
  - Text labels are clearly readable with node values displayed
  - The title follows the required format pattern
  weaknesses:
  - The visualization is NOT a Sankey diagram - it is a simplified arrow schematic
    that does not show flow widths proportional to values
  - All flows use the same color instead of distinct colors for different energy sources
    as required by the spec
  - No legend is present to identify energy source categories
  - The image appears to be generated by different code than what is in the implementation
    file
  - Individual flow paths between specific source-target pairs are not visible
