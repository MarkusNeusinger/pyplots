review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data quality with realistic, recognizable technology names and plausible
    ring assignments matching industry consensus
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with clear linear flow and reproducible
    seed
  - Good use of plotnine's layered grammar with multiple geom types (path, point,
    text, segment) composed together
  - Smart label alignment strategy (left-aligned for right side, right-aligned for
    left side) to reduce overlap
  - Correct title format and well-labeled legend
  weaknesses:
  - Multiple label overlaps in crowded areas, especially the Adopt ring where items
    cluster together — needs angular jittering or radial offset adjustment
  - Significant empty whitespace at the bottom of the canvas (~40%), with the radar
    shifted upward — consider adjusting figure_size or y-axis limits
  - No subtle background fill per ring to visually separate time horizons, which would
    greatly improve readability
  - Innovation labels at size 6.5 are small for the canvas size — increasing to 7.5-8
    would improve legibility
  - Ring name labels in italic gray are too subtle — consider bolder styling or a
    different placement strategy
  - Full 360-degree layout where the spec suggests half-circle or three-quarter to
    give more room for labels and legend
  - No visual hierarchy or storytelling emphasis — all points are the same size with
    no differentiation of importance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a technology innovation radar with concentric
    rings on a white background. Four concentric gray circles represent time horizons
    labeled in italic gray text: Adopt (innermost), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost).
    Four straight gray spokes divide the circle into quadrants labeled in bold black
    text at the outer edge: Cloud & Infra (top-right), Data Engineering (top-left),
    Security (bottom-left), and AI & ML (bottom-right). Each innovation is a colored
    dot — blue for AI & ML, green for Cloud & Infra, orange for Data Engineering,
    and purple for Security — with a colored text label beside it. The title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left. A legend labeled "Category"
    on the right maps colors to sectors. There are 26 labeled points total. The radar
    occupies roughly the upper 60% of the canvas with noticeable empty space below.
    Several labels in the Adopt ring overlap or crowd together (e.g., "Kubernetes"/"FinOps
    Platforms", "LLM Agents"/"RAG Pipelines"/"Federated Learning"). The ring name
    labels ("Adopt", "Trial", "Assess", "Hold") are positioned near the spoke between
    Security and AI & ML sectors.'

        comment: Font sizes explicitly set for title (24), sector headers (11), ring

          for 3600x3600 canvas. Ring labels in italic gray reduce readability.

        comment: No axis labels (axes hidden). Appropriate for radar chart but no
          descriptive labels with units exist. Ring labels serve as pseudo-axes but
          are minimal.
