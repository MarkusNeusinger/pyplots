review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly create_annotated_heatmap from figure_factory for native
    annotation support
  - Smart auto-contrast text color logic (white on dark, black on light backgrounds)
  - Custom hover template provides excellent interactivity
  - Realistic financial sector correlation data with proper structure
  - Proper diverging colorscale (RdBu_r) with zmid=0 for correlation data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic Sector - could be Stock Market Sector for more context
  - Colorbar thickness could be slightly larger for the canvas size
