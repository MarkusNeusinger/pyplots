review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly go.Indicator for displaying metrics with built-in delta
    formatting
  - Smart handling of higher_is_bad logic for delta colors (e.g., CPU decrease is
    green, but Disk I/O decrease is red)
  - Clean tile backgrounds using paper-referenced shapes
  - Sparklines implemented as separate scatter traces with area fill, properly positioned
    within each tile
  - Correct title format positioned as annotation
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Sparkline line width (2px) could be slightly thicker for better visibility at
    full resolution
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3x2 grid of dashboard metric tiles on a clean white background. Each tile has a light gray background (#f8fafc) with a subtle border. The title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in dark text.

    Top row (left to right):
    - CPU Usage: Large green "45%" value, with "▼-5.2%" delta indicator in green below, and a green area sparkline showing a downward trend
    - Memory: Large yellow/orange "72%" value, with "▲8.3%" delta in red below, and an orange area sparkline with fluctuating trend
    - Response Time: Large green "120ms" value, with "▼-15.4%" delta in green, and a green area sparkline showing variation

    Bottom row (left to right):
    - Requests/sec: Large green "1250" value, with "▲12.7%" delta in green, and a green area sparkline
    - Error Rate: Large red "2.3%" value (critical status), with "▲45.0%" delta in red, and a red area sparkline showing spiky pattern
    - Disk I/O: Large green "85MB/s" value, with "▼-2.1%" delta in red (since decrease is unfavorable for throughput), and a green area sparkline

    Color coding is correctly applied: green for good status, yellow/orange for warning (Memory), red for critical (Error Rate). Delta arrows and colors correctly reflect whether the change is favorable based on the metric type.
