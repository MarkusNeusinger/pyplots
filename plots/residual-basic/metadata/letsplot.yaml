review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of core residual plot features including reference line
    and LOESS smoother
  - Good data generation with realistic heteroscedasticity and deliberately placed
    outliers for diagnostic interest
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels
  - Appropriate color choices for accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha value)
  - Data context is generic rather than demonstrating a specific domain application
  image_description: The plot displays a residual plot with fitted values (15-100)
    on the x-axis and residuals (approximately -14 to 12) on the y-axis. Blue scatter
    points (with ~0.6 alpha transparency) show the distribution of residuals around
    zero. A red dashed horizontal reference line at y=0 provides a baseline for assessing
    bias. A yellow/gold LOESS smoothed trend line shows the local pattern in residuals,
    staying close to zero across the fitted value range. The plot has a clean minimal
    theme with subtle gray gridlines, clear axis labels ("Fitted Values" and "Residuals
    (Observed − Predicted)"), and the title "residual-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. Several outliers are visible (around -13 and +11), demonstrating realistic
    regression diagnostics.
