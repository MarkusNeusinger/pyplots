review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of crossword grid using Highcharts heatmap
  - Perfect 180-degree rotational symmetry in black cell placement
  - Clue numbering algorithm correctly identifies word start positions
  - Clean monochrome design suitable for printing
  - Square 1:1 aspect ratio as specified
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Clue numbers could be slightly larger for better visibility at smaller display
    sizes
  - Axis labels are functional but lack descriptive text
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with white entry
    cells and black blocking cells. The title "crossword-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. Row labels (A-O) are displayed on the left
    Y-axis, and column numbers (1-15) appear along the bottom X-axis. Black cells
    form a symmetric pattern typical of newspaper crosswords, with 180-degree rotational
    symmetry visible. Clue numbers (1-73) are positioned in the top-left corners of
    cells that start across or down words. The grid has clean black borders separating
    all cells, and the overall monochrome design follows traditional crossword conventions.
