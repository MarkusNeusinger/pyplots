review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette matching library guidelines
  - Clean center annotation showing total budget with proper formatting
  - Well-sized data labels with percentage formatting
  - Professional appearance with good ring thickness (55% inner size)
  - Proper Highcharts implementation with correct container setup
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears slightly small relative to the chart size on the right side
  - 'Center text could be better vertically centered (currently offset with y: 60)'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart showing budget allocation across
    5 categories. The chart has a hollow center displaying "Total $100M". Segments
    are colored with a colorblind-safe palette: blue (Marketing 28%), yellow (Development
    35%), purple (Operations 18%), cyan (Research 12%), and brown (Support 7%). Each
    segment has clear percentage labels positioned outside the ring. The title "donut-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A vertical legend on the right
    lists all categories with corresponding color indicators. The layout is clean
    with good whitespace balance.'

          but data values (28, 35, etc.) are treated as percentages

        comment: Uses Highcharts PieSeries with innerSize for donut effect, allowPointSelect
          for interactivity, proper subtitle positioning in center. Could leverage
          more Highcharts-specific features like tooltips or animations in the HTML
          output.
  verdict: APPROVED
