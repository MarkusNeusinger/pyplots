review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of voter migration with clear flow patterns
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between parties
  - Good use of transparency (0.35 opacity) for overlapping flows
  - Party labels on both sides make the diagram easy to read without a separate legend
  - Realistic election data scenario with plausible voter counts
  - Creative use of pygal as base with custom SVG for alluvial diagram
  weaknesses:
  - Subtitle font could be slightly larger for better readability
  - Title uses spaces around middot which is acceptable but slightly different from
    spec
