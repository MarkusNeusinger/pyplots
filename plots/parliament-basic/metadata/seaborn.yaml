review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular layout with 5 well-proportioned concentric arcs
  - Clean neutral data context using corporate departments
  - Proper random seed set for reproducibility
  - Good use of seaborn colorblind palette for accessibility
  - Clear legend with department names and seat counts
  - Helpful annotations for majority threshold and total seats
  - White edge borders on seats provide good visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some empty space below the baseline that could be better utilized
  - Title uses regular dots which work but could be improved
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament-style seat chart
    with 5 concentric arcs. The title "parliament-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold. A legend in the upper-left corner shows 6 departments: Engineering
    (85 seats, blue), Operations (72 seats, orange), Finance (45 seats, green), Marketing
    (38 seats, orange), Research (22 seats, pink), and Legal (18 seats, tan). Each
    seat is represented as a circular dot with white edge borders. A dashed gray horizontal
    line marks the baseline with "Majority: 141 seats" annotation on the right. At
    the bottom, "Total: 280 seats" is displayed. The layout fills the canvas well
    with balanced whitespace.'
