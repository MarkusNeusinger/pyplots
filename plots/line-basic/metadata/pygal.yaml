review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimal design that matches spec requirements perfectly
  - Excellent use of custom Style for font sizing on large canvas
  - Realistic temperature data that clearly demonstrates seasonal trends
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good color choice with accessible contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom-left appears small and somewhat disconnected from the chart
  - Font sizes in the library rules suggest smaller values (28/18/16) but implementation
    uses larger (72/48/42) - while this works for the large canvas, it deviates from
    the template
