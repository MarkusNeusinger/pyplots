review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including sorted bars,
    error bars, color gradient, and x=0 reference line
  - Uses wine dataset feature names which provides realistic, domain-appropriate context
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper sizing (16x9, fontsize 24/20/16)
  - Color gradient with colorbar adds visual emphasis as specified
  - Error bars with proper styling (capsize, linewidth) enhance readability
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label lacks units (e.g., (fraction) or (score decrease)) for full clarity
  - Could demonstrate more edge cases like several features with very similar near-zero
    importance
  - Limited use of distinctive matplotlib features beyond standard barh and colorbar
