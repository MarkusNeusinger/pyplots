review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of split violin using Altair transform_density and transform_calculate
    to create signed densities
  - Clean faceted layout with column encoding separates departments clearly
  - Good color choice with blue/yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Appropriate use of opacity (0.8) for the violin areas
  - Well-formatted title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic data scenario with varying distributions across departments
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Score lacks units (could be Score (points) or Score (%) for clarity)
  - No quartile markers or inner box plot as suggested in specification notes
  - Facets appear somewhat narrow/tall; horizontal aspect ratio could be more balanced
  - Extra HTML output not required for this implementation
