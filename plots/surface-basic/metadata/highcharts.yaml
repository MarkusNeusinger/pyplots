review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Creative wireframe approach using scatter3d with connecting lines creates effective
    surface visualization
  - Proper colorbar implementation with accurate value labels
  - Good 3D perspective angle showing both peaks clearly
  - Title follows correct format specification
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label not visible in the rendered view (depth axis label missing or obscured)
  - X-axis tick labels partially cut off at bottom edge of the image
  - Repetitive color calculation code could be cleaner (same interpolation logic repeated
    4 times)
  - Uses raw JavaScript chart configuration instead of highcharts-core Python library
    as per library guidelines
