review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Highcharts native export functionality with comprehensive
    menu options (PNG, SVG, PDF, CSV, XLS, print)
  - Professional button styling with hover states using pyplots brand colors
  - Subtitle clearly explains the export feature to users
  - Clean, well-organized chart configuration as dictionary
  - Proper inclusion of exporting.js and export-data.js modules for full functionality
  - Good visual hierarchy with clear title and data labels
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels on the line points are slightly small relative to the large canvas
    size
  - Legend positioned far from the chart area with extra spacing
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing monthly sales data over
    a year (January to December). The chart has a white background with a blue line
    (#306998) connecting data points. Each data point is marked with a circular marker
    and labeled with its value (ranging from 601 in January to 1,910 in December,
    showing cumulative growth). The title "chart-export-menu · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center in bold black text, with a subtitle explaining the export
    functionality ("Click the menu icon (≡) in top right to export as PNG, SVG, PDF,
    or CSV"). The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (units)" and shows values from 500 to 2000.
    The X-axis shows month abbreviations (Jan through Dec). A prominent blue hamburger
    menu button (≡) is visible in the top-right corner for export options - this is
    the key feature of the chart. The legend shows "Monthly Sales" at the bottom.
    Grid lines are subtle gray (#e0e0e0). The overall layout is clean and professional
    with good use of the canvas space.
