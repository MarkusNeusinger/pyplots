review:
  strengths:
  - Impressive creative solution implementing 3D surface in a 2D library using manual
    projection and painter algorithm
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for both aesthetics and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean, well-commented code explaining the projection mathematics
  - Added pan/zoom interactivity via selection_interval - appropriate for exploring
    a projected 2D view
  - Proper depth sorting ensures correct rendering order of surface facets
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - Rectangle-based approximation creates minor visual artifacts at facet edges (inherent
    limitation)
  - Axis labeling could be clearer - X (projected) and Z (height) may confuse users
    unfamiliar with 3D projection
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D surface projected onto 2D, representing
    the mathematical function z = sin(x) * cos(y). The surface is rendered using rectangular
    facets with the viridis colormap - yellow/bright green for peaks (~0.5 to 1.0)
    and dark purple/blue for valleys (~-0.5 to -1.0). The title "surface-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The X-axis is labeled "X (projected)" ranging
    from -5 to 5, and the Y-axis shows "Z (height)" from -2 to 2. A legend on the
    right displays "Z Value" with the color scale. The surface shows characteristic
    wave patterns of the sin*cos function with multiple peaks and valleys. Subtle
    blue-gray grid lines and faint edges on the facets provide structure without overwhelming
    the visualization.
