review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering
  - Clear notches visible on all boxes enabling median comparison
  - Thoughtful data generation with different distributions per department (bimodal
    Sales, tight Support, outliers in HR)
  - Professional color palette starting with Python blue
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend disabled - consider keeping for accessibility if plot is viewed without
    context
