review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme using consistent color families per department
    (blues for Engineering, yellows for Marketing, greens for Sales, purples for Operations)
  - 'Smart labeling strategy: labels only larger segments (>0.25 radians) to avoid
    clutter'
  - Center text showing total budget provides valuable context
  - Good use of Bokeh annular_wedge for creating proper donut rings with gap between
    inner/outer
  - White line separators create clear visual distinction between segments
  - Appropriate square format (3600x3600) for circular chart type
  weaknesses:
  - Figure dimensions differ from library guide recommendation (4800x2700), though
    square is appropriate for donut
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance interactivity in the HTML output
  - Inner ring label font size could be slightly larger given the segment sizes
