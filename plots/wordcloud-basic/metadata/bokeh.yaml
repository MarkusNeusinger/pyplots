review:
  strengths:
  - Clean semantic color scheme using Python blue/yellow branding that encodes frequency
    ranges
  - Comprehensive hover functionality with word and frequency tooltips for HTML export
  - Proper collision detection algorithm using Archimedean spiral placement
  - Good word selection with realistic technology/data science domain context
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Word cloud only fills ~35% of canvas with excessive whitespace; should expand
    to utilize more of the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Word rotation appears non-functional in output despite rotation logic in code
  - HoverTool and interactive features do not render in PNG export
  - Some minor word overlap in densely packed areas reduces readability
