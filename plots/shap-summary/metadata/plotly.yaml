review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the SHAP summary visualization concept with proper
    beeswarm-style jittering
  - Correct blue-to-red diverging colorscale (RdBu_r) for feature values as specified
  - Clear vertical reference line at x=0 separating positive/negative impacts
  - Well-organized code with realistic breast cancer dataset feature names
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for 200 data points
  - Interactive hover templates provide additional information on interaction
  weaknesses:
  - Hover template shows normalized feature value (0-1) instead of actual feature
    values which would be more informative
  - The grid styling is functional but could use slightly more prominent styling for
    the zero line
  - Feature importance distribution is relatively uniform - could show more dramatic
    differences between important and less important features
