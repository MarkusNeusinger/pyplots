review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized markers and line thickness for the high-resolution
    output
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color scheme using Python signature blue and yellow
  - Realistic and engaging temperature data scenario that demonstrates the plot type
    effectively
  - Clean title format following spec requirements exactly
  - Two distinct marker shapes (circle vs diamond) as recommended by the specification
  - Interactive HTML version also saved alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid lines could be more subtle (current gridLineWidth: 1 could be reduced or
    alpha lowered)'
  - The chart height in the rendered image (2561px) does not match the specified 2700px,
    suggesting potential cropping or rendering issue
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart with markers showing monthly
    temperature readings at two weather stations over 12 months (Jan-Dec). There are
    two series: "Station A (Coastal)" in dark blue (#306998) with circular markers,
    and "Station B (Inland)" in golden yellow (#FFD43B) with diamond markers. Both
    lines show clear seasonal temperature patterns - rising from winter lows (~2-6°C
    in January) to summer peaks (~24-27°C in July/August), then declining. The title
    "line-markers · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle "Monthly
    Temperature Readings at Two Weather Stations". The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)"
    ranging from 0-29, and the X-axis shows "Month" with all 12 month abbreviations.
    The legend is positioned in the top-right corner. Grid lines are subtle gray.
    The markers are clearly visible at each data point on both lines.'
