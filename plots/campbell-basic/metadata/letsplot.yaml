review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data quality with realistic rotordynamics scenario, correct gyroscopic
    effects, and comprehensive feature coverage
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data generation and intersection-finding
    logic
  - Good visual hierarchy separating mode curves (solid, colored, thick) from engine
    order lines (dashed, gray, thin)
  - Critical speed markers are correctly computed and visually distinct as red diamonds
  - All font sizes explicitly set for consistent readability at target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Engine order lines are not represented in the legend, making it harder for unfamiliar
    viewers to understand the distinction between solid and dashed lines
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-safe — consider replacing green with a
    more distinct color like orange or teal
  - Critical speed markers could benefit from being slightly larger or having a subtle
    highlight zone around them to increase visual impact
  - Could leverage more distinctive lets-plot features (e.g., interactive tooltips
    in HTML export, custom theme elements) to score higher on Library Mastery
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with four natural frequency
    mode curves plotted as solid colored lines against rotational speed (0–6000 RPM)
    on the x-axis and frequency (0–120 Hz) on the y-axis. The modes are: 1st Bending
    (blue, ~25 Hz baseline, slightly rising), 1st Torsional (green, ~48 Hz baseline,
    slightly falling), 2nd Bending (brown, ~72 Hz baseline, slightly rising), and
    Axial (gray, ~95 Hz baseline, slightly falling). Three dashed gray engine order
    lines (1×, 2×, 3×) radiate from the origin with bold gray labels near their upper
    ends. Red diamond markers are placed at each intersection of an engine order line
    with a natural frequency curve, indicating critical speeds. The title "campbell-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend titled "Mode Shape"
    appears on the right side. The background uses a minimal theme with light gray
    major gridlines and no minor gridlines. Overall the layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
