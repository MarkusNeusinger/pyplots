review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive implementation of all required Skew-T reference lines (isotherms,
    dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing ratios)
  - Clear visual distinction between temperature (red) and dewpoint (blue) profiles
  - Proper logarithmic pressure scale with inverted axis (high pressure at bottom)
  - Realistic synthetic atmospheric sounding data with appropriate temperature/dewpoint
    profiles
  - Well-constructed manual legend that identifies all line types
  - Clean separation of background reference lines from main profile data
  weaknesses:
  - Legend line samples appear visually thinner than expected compared to actual plot
    lines
  - The axis label Temperature (°C) - Skewed might confuse users unfamiliar with Skew-T
    diagrams
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a
    logarithmic, inverted pressure axis (1000 hPa at bottom to 100 hPa at top). The
    temperature profile is shown as a thick solid red line with red data point markers,
    while the dewpoint profile appears as a thick dashed blue line with blue markers.
    Both profiles follow the expected atmospheric pattern - temperature decreasing
    with altitude, dewpoint below temperature. Gray diagonal lines represent skewed
    isotherms (temperature reference lines at 45-degree angle). Orange dashed lines
    show dry adiabats, purple dash-dot lines show moist adiabats, and green dotted
    lines show mixing ratio lines. A manual legend in the upper right identifies each
    line type: Temp, Dewpt, Dry Ad., Moist Ad., and Mix. Ratio. The title correctly
    follows the format "skewt-logp-atmospheric · letsplot · pyplots.ai". Axes are
    labeled "Pressure (hPa)" and "Temperature (°C) - Skewed".'

          scale_y_log10, scale_y_reverse; good use but could leverage more interactive
