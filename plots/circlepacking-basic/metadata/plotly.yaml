review:
  strengths:
  - Clean color scheme using Python blue/yellow palette with good visual contrast
  - Effective use of Plotly shapes and annotations to create circles with labels
  - Hover interactivity added via invisible scatter traces
  - Clear hierarchy visualization with parent-child relationship
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Child circles positioned manually rather than using circle packing algorithm (spec
    requires efficient packing)
  - Text overlap in Documents category where Presentations label intersects parent
    label
  - No legend explaining the color-category mapping
  - Only 16 nodes total (4 categories × 4 including parents) - spec suggests 20-200
    nodes
  - Could leverage Plotly native treemap for better hierarchical visualization
