review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of contour plot using heatmap + line series overlay
    approach
  - White contour lines with black shadow provide superior visibility across all color
    values
  - Well-implemented marching squares algorithm for smooth contour extraction
  - Proper viridis colormap (colorblind-safe) with clearly visible colorbar
  - Contour level annotations are clean and well-positioned
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Highcharts interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines configured in code are not visible in the final output
  - Contour labels cluster in the lower-left peak area, minor readability concern
  - Code uses helper functions which deviates from KISS structure (though justified
    for algorithm complexity)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a contour visualization using a heatmap background
    with overlaid white contour lines and black shadow outlines for visibility. The
    colormap is viridis (purple to yellow gradient), showing three distinct regions:
    a bright yellow high-value peak in the upper-right (~90%), a yellow-green peak
    in the lower-left (~80%), and a dark purple low-value region in the upper-center
    (~10%). White contour lines clearly delineate iso-levels from 10% to 90% in 10%
    increments. Each contour level is labeled with a white rectangular annotation
    showing the percentage value. The title reads "contour-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. X-axis is labeled "X Position (units)" and Y-axis is labeled "Y Position
    (units)", both ranging from approximately -3.0 to 3.0. A vertical colorbar on
    the right shows "Intensity (%)" from 0% to 100%.'

        comment: Contour labels are well-placed along the lines. Minor clustering
          of labels in the lower-left peak (30%-80% labels stack vertically), but
          still readable.

        comment: Has colorbar, contour lines, filled regions, and labeled levels.
          The specification suggests "Consider using both contour lines and filled
          regions for clarity" - this is done well. However, no diverging colormap
          option shown (only viridis which is sequential).

        comment: Shows multiple peaks (high values), a valley (low value region),

        comment: Code uses functions (marching_squares_contour, connect_segments)
          rather than flat script structure. While these are necessary for the contour
          extraction algorithm, it deviates from the KISS principle.

        comment: Excellent use of Highcharts heatmap module with annotations API for
          contour labels. Custom marching squares algorithm to generate contour lines
          as overlay series. Shadow effect on contour lines for visibility. Interactive
          HTML output alongside PNG.
