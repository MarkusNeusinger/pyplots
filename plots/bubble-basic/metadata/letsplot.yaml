review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot distinctive layer_tooltips() feature with formatted
    fields and custom line labels
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue (#306998) and complementary
    colors
  - LOESS trend line with confidence band adds analytical value showing revenue-growth
    inverse relationship
  - scale_size_area() correctly scales bubbles by area per spec requirement
  - All font sizes explicitly set for the 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Realistic market analysis scenario with plausible business data
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance could improve: two separate legends (size + color) take up too
    much horizontal space, compressing the data area'
  - 'Data storytelling is moderate: LOESS line helps but no strong visual focal point
    or emphasis to guide the viewer to a specific insight'
  - Sector data distributions are somewhat homogeneous; more distinct sector characteristics
    would better showcase the bubble chart ability to reveal sector-level patterns
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bubble chart with "Revenue (Million USD)"
    on the x-axis (range ~10-190) and "Growth Rate (%)" on the y-axis (range ~2-21).
    Bubble sizes represent "Market Share (%)" with a size legend showing values from
    5 to 25. Five sectors are color-coded: Technology (dark blue), Healthcare (orange),
    Finance (teal/green), Energy (purple), and Consumer Goods (coral/red). A LOESS
    trend line with gray confidence band runs through the data, showing a slight negative
    relationship between revenue and growth rate. The title reads "bubble-basic ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" in the top-left. Both size and color legends appear on
    the right side. The minimal theme has subtle light gray gridlines with no minor
    grid. The 45 data points are distributed across the full revenue range with varying
    bubble sizes and good alpha transparency (0.65).'
