review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of seaborn heatmap to render barcode as binary matrix
  - Complete and correct EAN-13 encoding implementation with all patterns (L, G, R
    codes)
  - Clean publication-quality appearance with proper quiet zones and guard patterns
  - Human-readable digits properly formatted and positioned
  - Good use of sns.color_palette to create custom binary colormap
  weaknesses:
  - Barcode uses non-standard color (blue instead of traditional black) - though stylistically
    consistent with pyplots branding
  image_description: The plot displays a standard EAN-13 barcode rendered using seaborn's
    heatmap function. The barcode consists of vertical bars in Python blue (#306998)
    on a white background. The bars vary in width (1-4 modules) following proper EAN-13
    encoding standards, with visible start guard, center guard, and end guard patterns.
    Quiet zones (white space) are present on both sides of the barcode. The title
    "barcode-ean13 · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears centered above the barcode in dark
    gray bold text. Below the barcode, the human-readable digits "4  006381  333931"
    are displayed in blue monospace font, properly formatted with the first digit
    separated, then two groups of 6 digits each. The layout is clean with good use
    of canvas space.
