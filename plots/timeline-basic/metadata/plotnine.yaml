review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents text overlap entirely
  - Colorblind-safe palette with four distinct, accessible colors for phases
  - Clean implementation of timeline using ggplot grammar of graphics
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic software development project scenario with meaningful milestones
  weaknesses:
  - Event spacing is very uniform (roughly monthly) - more varied spacing would better
    demonstrate timeline capabilities
  - Axis label Date could be more descriptive (e.g., Project Timeline 2024)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline showing 12 software
    development project milestones spanning from January 2024 to December 2024. Events
    are represented as colored circular markers positioned alternately above and below
    a central horizontal axis line, with vertical connector lines linking each marker
    to the axis. Labels for each event (e.g., "Project Kickoff", "Requirements Complete",
    "Production Launch") are positioned above or below their respective markers in
    alternating fashion to prevent overlap. The timeline uses four distinct colors
    to represent different project phases: blue (#306998) for Planning, yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Development, orange (#E69F00) for Testing, and green (#009E73) for Release.
    The x-axis shows quarterly date markers from 2024-01-01 to 2025-01-01. A legend
    at the bottom identifies the four phases. The title "timeline-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.'

        comment: Legend well-placed at bottom; vertical grid lines are subtle (alpha=0.3),
          but the vertical connector lines from points could be mistaken for grid
          elements

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_segment, geom_point, geom_text,
