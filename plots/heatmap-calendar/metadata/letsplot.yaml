quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent calendar layout with proper week numbering and month positioning
  - Realistic GitHub-style contribution data with clear weekday patterns (reduced
    weekend activity)
  - Clean sequential colormap that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of scale_y_reverse to position Monday at top (GitHub convention)
  - Well-sized tiles with white borders for clear cell separation
  - Good text sizing throughout for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are empty strings rather than descriptive (e.g., "Week of Year" for
    x, "Day of Week" for y)
  - Could use a more distinctive lets-plot feature like tooltips or flavor_high_contrast_dark
