review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required K-S test features implemented correctly
    (ECDFs, max divergence line, D statistic, p-value)
  - Strong visual storytelling with the purple distance annotation creating a clear
    focal point at the maximum divergence
  - Idiomatic Altair layer composition with well-structured encoding channels
  - Polished design with custom colors, styled legend, subtle grid, and informative
    subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - The shaded band at the K-S distance is nearly invisible (opacity 0.18, tiny point
    size 18) — either make it more visible or remove it since it does not contribute
    meaningfully
  - The shade band implementation using 40 individual mark_points is a workaround;
    consider using a rect mark or rule for cleaner code
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step functions on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. The blue
    solid line (#306998) represents "Good Customers" and the orange dashed line (#E8833A)
    represents "Bad Customers", with credit scores on the X-axis (range ~100–1000)
    and cumulative proportion on the Y-axis (0.0–1.0). A dashed purple (#7B2D8E) vertical
    line marks the point of maximum divergence at approximately score 540, with two
    filled purple dots at the endpoints of the distance line. The label "D = 0.623"
    appears in purple monospace bold text to the right of the distance line. A faint
    purple shaded region (tiny dots at low opacity) runs along the K-S distance line.
    The title reads "ks-test-comparison · altair · pyplots.ai" in the top-left, with
    a gray subtitle "K-S Statistic: 0.623 · p < 0.001 · Distributions are significantly
    different". A bordered legend in the top-right identifies both groups with their
    line styles.'
