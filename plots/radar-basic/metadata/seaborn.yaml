review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and appropriate use
    of the colorblind palette
  - 'Perfect implementation of all spec requirements: filled polygons with alpha 0.25,
    gridlines at correct intervals, closed polygons connecting back to first point'
  - Realistic employee performance comparison scenario that matches spec applications
  - Good use of seaborn styling (set_theme with poster context) to achieve proper
    scaling
  - Square aspect ratio is appropriate for radar charts, canvas well-utilized
  weaknesses:
  - Radar charts lack units notation - could add "(Score 0-100)" in subtitle or annotation
  - The two employee profiles could show more contrasting values to better demonstrate
    radar chart comparison capability
