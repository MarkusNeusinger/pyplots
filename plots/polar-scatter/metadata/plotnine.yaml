review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation using Cartesian coordinates to simulate polar
    projection (plotnine lacks native polar coordinates)
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach with multiple geom layers for gridlines, spokes,
    data points, and labels
  - Realistic wind data with prevailing directions (SW and NE clusters) that demonstrate
    real-world wind patterns
  - Good use of alpha transparency to handle point overlap in dense regions
  - Proper compass orientation with 0° at North and clockwise angles
  - Clear visual hierarchy with bold compass labels and subtle gridlines
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" not "Wind
    Direction and Speed · polar-scatter · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
  - Figure size is 12x12 (square) at 300 DPI = 3600x3600 which is valid, but the recommended
    16:9 landscape might provide better label spacing
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area to reduce whitespace on the
    right
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar scatter visualization of wind direction
    and speed data. It features concentric dashed circular gridlines at 5, 10, 15,
    20, and 25 m/s intervals. Eight radial spokes extend from the center to compass
    directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), with bold dark gray labels at the perimeter.
    Speed labels (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 m/s) are positioned along the NNE axis. Data points
    are rendered as filled circles with alpha transparency, colored by time of day:
    blue (Morning), yellow (Afternoon), and red/coral (Evening). The data clearly
    shows two clusters - one in the SW quadrant (prevailing wind) and another in the
    NE quadrant (secondary wind). The legend "Time of Day" is positioned on the right
    side with all three categories listed. The title "Wind Direction and Speed · polar-scatter
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.'

        comment: Uses grammar of graphics approach with geom_point, geom_path, geom_segment,
          geom_text layers; good use of aes() and scale_color_manual; however, plotnine
          does not have native coord_polar so this creative Cartesian workaround is
          necessary
  verdict: APPROVED
