quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean stacking implementation with proper bottom/top calculations
  - White line separators between segments improve readability
  - Realistic educational scenario with meaningful group differences
  - Proper use of consistent bin edges across all groups
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two blue colors (dark #306998 and light #4B8BBE) may cause confusion for colorblind
    users; consider using more distinct hues'
  - Does not use ColumnDataSource which is idiomatic Bokeh practice
  - Some test scores exceed 100 points which is atypical for standard tests
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked histogram showing test score distributions
    for three study groups. The x-axis shows "Test Score (points)" ranging from approximately
    40 to 120, and the y-axis shows "Frequency (count)" from 0 to about 83. Three
    colored segments are stacked: dark blue (Self-study Group) at bottom, yellow (Regular
    Study Group) in middle, and light blue (Intensive Study Group) on top. The distributions
    show realistic patterns with Self-study peaking around 65, Regular around 75,
    and Intensive around 82. A legend is positioned in the top-right corner. White
    line separators between bar segments provide clear visual distinction. The title
    "histogram-stacked · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at top-left.'
