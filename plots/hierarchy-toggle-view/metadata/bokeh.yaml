review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (CustomJS, Button widgets, ColumnDataSource)
  - Well-implemented dual-view architecture with toggle functionality in HTML
  - Realistic company budget data with proper 3-level hierarchy
  - Good canvas utilization and color scheme
  - Proper squarify algorithm implementation for treemap layout
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Labels not rendering in PNG export - LabelSet elements are created
    but not appearing in the exported PNG image, making the treemap uninterpretable'
  - No legend to identify what each color represents
  - Title text appears small relative to the large canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a treemap visualization of a company budget
    allocation hierarchy. The canvas shows colored rectangles representing leaf nodes
    of the hierarchy: yellow/gold tones for Engineering sub-departments (Backend,
    Frontend, DevOps, QA), teal/cyan for Marketing (Digital, Content, Analytics),
    orange tones for Operations (Logistics, Facilities, Procurement), and purple tones
    for HR (Recruiting, Training, Benefits). The rectangles are arranged using a squarify
    algorithm with white borders separating them. The title "hierarchy-toggle-view
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left in blue. CRITICAL ISSUE: No text
    labels are visible on any of the rectangles - the department names and budget
    values that should appear on each rectangle are completely missing from the PNG
    export. The layout fills approximately 70% of the canvas with good proportions.
    The background is light gray (#fafafa).'
