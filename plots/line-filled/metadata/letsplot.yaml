review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_area + geom_line + geom_point combination for a complete
    filled line visualization
  - Perfect title format and well-chosen realistic data context (website traffic)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility seed
  - Good visual balance with appropriate fill transparency (0.4) and line visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Month (2024)" or "Visitors (thousands)")
  - Data variation could be more pronounced to better showcase the filled area effect
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart showing monthly website
    traffic over 12 months. The chart uses a blue color (#306998) with a semi-transparent
    fill (alpha ~0.4) below the line. A solid blue line traces the data points, with
    blue circular markers at each month. The y-axis shows "Website Visitors" ranging
    from 0 to approximately 70,000, and the x-axis shows "Month" with values 1-12.
    The title "line-filled · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot uses
    a minimal theme with subtle gray horizontal grid lines on a white background.
    The data shows variation with a peak around month 4 (~70,000 visitors) and a dip
    at month 2 (~55,000 visitors).
