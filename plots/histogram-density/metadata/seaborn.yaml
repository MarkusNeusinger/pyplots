review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of bimodal distribution to demonstrate density histogram capabilities
  - Perfect combination of histplot (stat="density") and kdeplot - showcases seaborn
    statistical visualization strength
  - Clean color scheme with high contrast blue/yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper canvas utilization with 16:9 aspect ratio
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate bin count (25) for the data size (500 points)
  weaknesses:
  - KDE line is slightly thick (linewidth=4) which could overshadow the histogram
    bars in some areas
