review:
  strengths:
  - Mathematically correct Smith chart implementation with proper constant-r circles
    and constant-x arcs
  - Excellent realistic RF engineering data scenario with antenna resonance model
  - Clean visual hierarchy with yellow locus standing out against blue/gray grid
  - 'Good use of Bokeh features: ColumnDataSource, Label annotations, both PNG and
    HTML export'
  - Proper normalization and gamma conversion mathematics
  - Well-positioned frequency labels with offset to avoid overlap with data points
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool for interactive impedance/frequency inspection in the HTML
    version
  - Grid r/x labels are slightly small compared to other text elements
  - Axis labels could include dimensionless clarification
  image_description: The plot shows a Smith chart with the classic circular impedance
    coordinate system. A blue outer boundary represents the unit circle (|Γ| = 1).
    Gray constant resistance circles (r = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2) are visible emanating from
    the right side, and gray constant reactance arcs curve symmetrically above and
    below the horizontal axis. A yellow impedance locus curve with circular markers
    traces a frequency sweep from 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz, forming a characteristic loop
    pattern in the right half of the chart. Frequency labels (1.0 GHz, 2.2 GHz, 3.6
    GHz, 4.8 GHz, 6.0 GHz) are placed at key points along the locus in blue text.
    A dark blue marker at the center marks the matched condition (Z=Z₀). Small gray
    labels indicate r-values (r=0.2, r=0.5, r=1, r=2) along the horizontal axis and
    x-values (x=0.5, x=1, x=2) on the boundary arcs. The title "smith-chart-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at top-left. Axes are labeled "Real(Γ)" and "Imag(Γ)".
    The background is light gray (#fafafa).

        comment: Yellow/gold (#FFD43B) locus against blue (#306998) boundary provides

        comment: Square aspect ratio is appropriate for Smith chart. Good utilization
          of canvas with x_range/y_range (-1.35, 1.35) providing balanced margins.

        comment: Labels Real(Γ) and Imag(Γ) are descriptive but lack explicit units

        comment: Grid alpha=0.4 is appropriate; no explicit legend but frequency labels
          serve the purpose.
