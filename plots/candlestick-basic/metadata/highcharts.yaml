review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using Python Blue (#306998) for bullish and
    warm amber (#E67E22) for bearish candles
  - Proper use of Highcharts Stock module which is designed for financial charts with
    native candlestick support
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with appropriate daily volatility and market behavior
  - Clean layout with well-proportioned margins and properly scaled text sizes for
    4800x2700
  - Correctly skips weekends in date generation for realistic trading day simulation
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that aid price level reading without being distracting
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line alpha (0.15) could be slightly higher for better price level readability
