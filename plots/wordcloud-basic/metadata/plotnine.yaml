review:
  strengths:
  - Good color scheme with Python blue/yellow branding and colorblind-safe palette
  - Realistic tech survey context with meaningful keyword data
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Title format correctly includes spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  - Font size scaling creates clear visual hierarchy for frequency
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical text overlap in center area: Learning and Cloud collide, DevOps overlaps
    with Data and surrounding words, Performance is partially obscured'
  - Concentric ring positioning algorithm needs wider spacing or collision detection
    to prevent word overlap
  - No legend explaining what the colors represent (frequency tiers)
