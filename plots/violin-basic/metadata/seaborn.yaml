review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of violin plot with bimodal Sales distribution showing
    the power of KDE visualization
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter and legend=False
  - Clear quartile markers inside violins (inner="quart") as spec requires
  - Well-formatted currency axis with $Xk notation
  - Good color contrast with blue/gold alternating palette
  weaknesses:
  - Alternating colors by department do not add informational value; a single color
    or gradient by position would be cleaner
  - Could use inner="quartile" to show individual quartile lines more distinctly,
    or add miniature box plots with inner="box"
  - Missing y-axis grid extension through violins (grid only on axis area)
