review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stacked histogram concept using pygal StackedBar
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Realistic plant growth scenario with meaningful group labels
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Good color palette with sufficient contrast between groups
  - Appropriate use of custom Style for consistent theming
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in top-left corner could be moved to avoid proximity to plot area
  - Could leverage more pygal-specific features like custom tooltips or value labels
