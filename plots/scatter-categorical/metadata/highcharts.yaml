review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clear visual separation between categories with distinct patterns
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic plant growth study scenario with meaningful data
  - Good marker sizing with white borders for distinction
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Interactive HTML reuses the 4800x2700 chart JS literal instead of regenerating
    at smaller size, causing potential sizing issues
  - No alpha transparency on markers despite spec suggestion for overlapping points
  - Legend positioned at fixed pixel offset rather than responsive positioning
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical scatter plot showing the relationship
    between Nitrogen Applied (kg/ha) on the x-axis and Plant Growth (cm) on the y-axis.
    Three fertilizer types are distinguished by color: Fertilizer A (blue #306998),
    Fertilizer B (yellow #FFD43B), and Fertilizer C (purple #9467BD). The title "scatter-categorical
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top center. A vertical
    legend in the top-right corner identifies each category. The plot shows clear
    differentiation between groups - Fertilizer B (yellow) shows the highest growth
    values, Fertilizer A (blue) shows moderate growth, and Fertilizer C (purple) shows
    lower, more scattered values. Grid lines are subtle and do not distract from the
    data. Markers are circular with white borders and appropriately sized for the
    data density (~120 points total).'

        comment: Shows three distinct categories with different correlation patterns.
          Fertilizer B shows steeper slope and higher values, C shows more variance.
          Good variety but could show more extreme outliers.

        comment: Nitrogen 15-85 kg/ha and growth 0-70 cm are plausible. Some growth
          values could be slightly more realistic (growth values starting near 0 would
          be more realistic).

        comment: Saves as "plot.png" but also creates plot.html (acceptable but the
          HTML variable naming reuses f-string incorrectly - `interactive_html` variable
          contains `html_str` which uses original chart dimensions)

        comment: Uses Highcharts scatter series with proper options, hover states,
          and generates both PNG and HTML output. Could leverage more Highcharts features
          like tooltips with custom formatting.
