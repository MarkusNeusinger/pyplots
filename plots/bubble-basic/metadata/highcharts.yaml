review:
  strengths:
  - Correct bubble chart implementation with three data dimensions clearly represented
  - Excellent title and subtitle formatting with bubble size explanation
  - Good use of transparency (0.6 opacity) for handling overlapping bubbles
  - Realistic tech company comparison scenario with sensible data ranges
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good use of Highcharts tooltip with custom HTML formatting showing all three data
    values
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are very dense (every 10 units from 0-660), could use larger
    intervals
  - Bubble size legend appears to be cut off or not fully visible at the bottom
  - No categorical color dimension shown (optional per spec but would enhance demonstration)
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with 30 data points representing
    tech company comparisons. The bubbles are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998)
    with semi-transparent fill. The title "bubble-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold, followed by a subtitle "Bubble size represents Market
    Capitalization". The x-axis shows "Revenue (Billion USD)" ranging from 0 to 660,
    and the y-axis shows "Growth Rate (%)" ranging from 0 to 54. Bubbles vary in size
    from small (representing lower market cap) to large (representing higher market
    cap). The data shows a general negative correlation between revenue and growth
    rate - smaller companies have higher growth rates while larger companies have
    lower growth rates. A subtle grid is visible, and there appears to be a legend
    entry at the bottom (partially visible).
  verdict: APPROVED
