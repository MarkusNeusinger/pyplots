review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color contrast with colorblind-safe blue/yellow combination
  - LOWESS curve is smooth and clearly distinguishable from scatter points
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle mentioning the smoothing parameter
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for data density
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Custom LOWESS implementation works correctly with tricube weighting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than context-specific
  - Custom function definition in code deviates from KISS principle (though necessary)
  - Data could be tied to a more realistic scenario with meaningful labels
