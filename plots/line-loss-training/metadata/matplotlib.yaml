review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of overfitting pattern with clear divergence between training
    and validation loss
  - Optimal early stopping point annotation is well-executed with arrow and styled
    bbox
  - Color choices (blue and yellow) are colorblind-safe and provide excellent contrast
  - Clean KISS structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - All specification requirements are met including distinct colors, legend, and
    loss function labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper right slightly overlaps with early epoch data points;
    consider upper center or outside plot
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like fill_between for confidence intervals
    or secondary annotations
  image_description: 'The plot displays two line curves on a 16:9 canvas with a white
    background. The title "line-loss-training · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in italicized black text. The X-axis is labeled "Epoch" (ranging from
    0 to 50), and the Y-axis is labeled "Cross-Entropy Loss" (ranging from 0.0 to
    2.5+). Two distinct lines with markers are shown:

    - **Training Loss** (blue line with circular markers): Starts at ~2.5 and decays
    exponentially to ~0.2 by epoch 50

    - **Validation Loss** (yellow/golden line with square markers): Starts similarly
    high but shows overfitting behavior after epoch ~28, where it begins increasing
    while training loss continues to decrease

    A large red circular marker with black border highlights "Best: Epoch 29" - the
    optimal early stopping point - with an arrow annotation pointing to it. The legend
    is positioned in the upper right corner. The grid is subtle with dashed gray lines
    at alpha 0.3.'

        comment: Loss values are reasonable, but initial loss of ~2.5 is slightly
          high for typical cross-entropy (usually starts around 1-2 for multi-class
          classification); minor deduction

        comment: Good use of annotation with arrowprops and bbox styling, scatter
          for emphasis point, but no advanced matplotlib-specific features like twin
          axes, secondary y-axis, or fill_between for confidence intervals
  verdict: APPROVED
