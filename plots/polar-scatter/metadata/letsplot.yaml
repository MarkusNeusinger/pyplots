review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate implementation with proper compass direction labels
    (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
  - Realistic wind data simulation using directional probability weighting and Weibull
    distribution for speeds
  - Clean, colorblind-accessible color scheme (Python Blue, Yellow, Purple)
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with coord_polar transformation
  - Square 1:1 aspect ratio is ideal for polar plots
  weaknesses:
  - Some data point overlap in the NW/SW high-density sectors - consider slightly
    smaller point size or lower alpha
  - Legend positioning creates slight layout asymmetry
  image_description: 'The polar scatter plot displays wind observations using compass
    directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) around the perimeter with concentric circles
    showing wind speed from 0 to 18 m/s. Data points (120 observations) are colored
    by time of day: blue (Morning), yellow (Afternoon), and purple (Evening). The
    plot shows realistic prevailing wind patterns with higher concentrations from
    the NW, W, and SW directions, matching the spec''s requirement for realistic directional
    distributions. The title "Wind Observations · polar-scatter · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is positioned at the top, and a legend "Time of Day" is on the right. The radial
    axis is labeled "Wind Speed (m/s)" on the left side. The grid uses subtle gray
    lines with good visual hierarchy.'
