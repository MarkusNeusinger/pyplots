review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native modebar for export functionality - this is the
    library's distinctive feature for this spec
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Proper configuration of toImageButtonOptions allowing custom export dimensions
    (4800x2700)
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated, showcasing static and interactive capabilities
  - Good color accessibility with blue/yellow palette distinguishable for colorblind
    users
  weaknesses:
  - CSV data export not implemented (spec mentions extract the underlying data as
    CSV)
  - Grid and legend could be slightly better tuned - grid alpha at 0.1 is very subtle
  - Legend placement style could be refined for optimal positioning
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with two data series tracking
    cumulative monthly sales over a 12-month period (January to December). Product
    A is shown in dark blue (#306998) and Product B in golden yellow (#FFD43B), both
    with lines and circular markers. The chart has a clean white background using
    plotly_white template. The title "chart-export-menu · plotly · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top. The y-axis shows "Cumulative Sales (units)" ranging from
    approximately 100 to 1300, while the x-axis displays abbreviated month names.
    A legend in the upper-left corner identifies the two series. Subtle gray gridlines
    are visible. Both lines show steady upward growth trends, with Product A consistently
    outperforming Product B.
