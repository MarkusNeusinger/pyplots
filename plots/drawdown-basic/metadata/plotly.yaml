review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including max drawdown annotation,
    recovery points, and statistics box
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of Plotly features like hover templates and annotation boxes
  - Appropriate color scheme with red for losses and green for recovery
  - Statistics panel provides useful context
  weaknesses:
  - Statistics box on the right edge appears slightly cut off (days truncated)
  - Recovery point markers (green triangles) could be slightly larger for better visibility
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like rangeslider for
    time series navigation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart showing percentage decline
    from peak value over time (approximately 2 years from Jan 2022 to late 2023).
    The drawdown area is filled with a semi-transparent red/pink color (rgba). A clear
    zero baseline is shown as a dark horizontal line at 0%. The title "drawdown-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The Y-axis shows "Drawdown (%)"
    with percentage ticks from 0% to -60%. The X-axis shows "Date" with quarterly
    time labels. A red diamond marker annotates the maximum drawdown point at -63.4%
    around April 2023. Green triangle markers at the zero line indicate recovery points
    (new highs). A statistics box on the right displays: Max Drawdown: -63.44%, Max
    Duration: 490 days, Recovery Points: 3. The legend at the top shows "Drawdown"
    (red line) and "Recovery (New High)" (green triangle).'
