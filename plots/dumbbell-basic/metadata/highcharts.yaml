review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native dumbbell chart type with proper module loading
  - Clean horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended by spec
  - Data sorted by change magnitude to reveal patterns (spec suggestion implemented)
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Data labels on dots make values immediately readable
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario with appropriate department names
  - Proper inline script embedding for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - All changes are positive (no negative changes shown) - adding one or two departments
    with decreased satisfaction would demonstrate more feature coverage
  - Legend text could be more descriptive with colors mentioned
  - Y-axis title present but x-axis title is null - could benefit from clearer axis
    labeling
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal dumbbell chart showing employee
    satisfaction scores before and after policy changes across 8 departments. Each
    department has two dots connected by a thin gray line: a blue dot (#306998) representing
    the "before" score and a yellow dot (#FFD43B) representing the "after" score.
    Data labels display the numeric values on each dot. Departments are listed on
    the y-axis (Customer Support, Operations, Research & Development, Engineering,
    Sales, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance) and sorted by the magnitude of change
    in descending order. The title reads "Employee Satisfaction Before/After · dumbbell-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Satisfaction scores before and after
    policy changes by department". A legend in the top-right shows "Before → After".
    The x-axis ranges from approximately 40 to 95 representing satisfaction scores.'
