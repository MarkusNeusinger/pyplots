review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.ecdfplot with hue parameter for idiomatic seaborn ECDF plotting
  - Strong data storytelling with the shaded divergence band, annotation with arrow,
    and prominent dots at max distance
  - Clean, realistic credit scoring context with appropriate sample sizes and score
    ranges
  - All text sizes explicitly set to appropriate values for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between teal and orange
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance: the wide shaded fill band (+-60 points) creates visual weight
    imbalance in the center-right of the plot'
  - Uses private attribute legend._loc = 2 instead of public API (legend.set_loc or
    repositioning via legend kwargs)
  - ECDF lines could use different linestyles (solid vs dashed) in addition to color
    for maximum accessibility
  - The K-S statistic of 0.717 is extremely high — a more moderate separation would
    be more educational for demonstrating the test
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step curves comparing "Good Customers" (dark teal/blue, #1B6B93) and
    "Bad Customers" (dark orange, #D35400) credit score distributions. The x-axis
    shows "Credit Score (points)" ranging from ~350 to ~950, and the y-axis shows
    "Cumulative Proportion" from 0.0 to 1.0. A dashed vertical black line at approximately
    660 points marks the point of maximum divergence between the two distributions,
    with two black dots (white-edged) at the intersection points on each ECDF curve.
    A shaded orange band (~60 points wide) fills the area between the curves around
    the maximum divergence region. An annotation box in the lower-right area displays
    "K-S Statistic = 0.717" and "p-value = 5.46e-60" in bold, connected to the midpoint
    of the divergence line by a curved arrow. The legend sits in the upper-left corner.
    Top and right spines are removed; a subtle y-axis grid is visible. The title reads
    "Credit Score Distributions · ks-test-comparison · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
