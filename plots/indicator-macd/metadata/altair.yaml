review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent layer composition combining histogram bars, two lines, and zero reference
  - Proper use of resolve_scale for independent color legends
  - Good use of strokeDash to differentiate signal line visually
  - Tooltips with formatted values enhance usability
  - Subtitle documents the MACD parameters (12, 26, 9)
  - Clean data preparation with proper EMA calculations using pandas ewm()
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label combines both Histogram and MACD Value which is slightly verbose
  - Initial MACD values are quite extreme (-3 to -4), though technically possible
  - Generates both plot.png and plot.html (only png required per spec)
  image_description: The plot displays a MACD technical indicator chart with three
    distinct components overlaid on a single panel. The histogram bars use green (#2E7D32)
    for positive values and red (#C62828) for negative values, clearly showing momentum
    shifts around the zero line. The MACD line is rendered in solid blue (#306998)
    and the Signal line in dashed yellow/orange (#FFD43B). The X-axis shows dates
    from June to late September 2025, with the Y-axis labeled "Histogram, MACD Value"
    ranging from approximately -4.0 to 1.4. The title follows the correct format "indicator-macd
    · altair · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle indicating "MACD (12, 26, 9) - Moving Average
    Convergence Divergence". Two separate legends appear on the right side - one for
    "Histogram" (Positive/Negative) and one for "Lines" (MACD/Signal). A subtle gray
    dashed zero reference line is visible. The chart shows realistic trading dynamics
    with multiple crossover points and momentum reversals.

        comment: Uses layer composition, tooltips, stroke dash for differentiation,
          resolve_scale for independent colors - good Altair usage but could leverage
          interactivity more
