review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clean data labels positioned on top of each bar for easy reading
  - Appropriate single-color scheme that is colorblind-safe
  - Realistic retail sales scenario with meaningful category names
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of Highcharts configuration options (borderRadius, pointPadding, marginBottom)
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid lines are slightly too prominent (gridLineWidth: 1 with #e0e0e0 could be
    more subtle)'
  - Uses raw dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python library classes
  - Bar height variation could be more pronounced to better demonstrate ranking differences
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart (column chart) with 6
    blue bars (#306998) on a white background. The title "bar-basic · highcharts ·
    pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center. The x-axis shows product categories:
    Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, and Toys. The y-axis shows
    "Sales (Units)" ranging from 0 to 4500. Each bar has a data label showing the
    exact value (4,200, 3,100, 2,800, 2,400, 1,900, 1,500). The bars are well-spaced
    with subtle rounded corners. Grid lines are visible on the y-axis with a light
    gray color. The layout is clean with good margins.'
