review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart geometry with correct mathematical formulas
    for constant resistance circles and reactance arcs
  - Clean visualization with appropriate color coding (blue grid, yellow locus, green/red
    markers)
  - Good use of layer composition with multiple geom_path and geom_point layers
  - Proper conversion from normalized impedance to reflection coefficient (gamma)
  - Frequency labels at key points along the impedance trajectory
  weaknesses:
  - Lower portion of Smith chart is largely empty; impedance locus could be designed
    to traverse more regions of the chart
  - No VSWR circles shown (though spec marks this as optional)
  - Missing legend explaining start/end marker colors
  - Interactive features of lets-plot not utilized (hover tooltips on impedance points
    would enhance usability)
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart with the standard circular grid
    structure. The outer boundary is a dark black circle representing |γ| = 1 (total
    reflection). The chart features light blue constant resistance circles (concentrically
    positioned along the horizontal axis) and constant reactance arcs (curving from
    the right edge). A horizontal black line represents the real axis through the
    center. The yellow impedance locus curve shows an antenna impedance sweep from
    1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz, with the trajectory creating an irregular pattern in the upper-left
    quadrant. A green marker indicates the start point (1.0 GHz) and a red marker
    indicates the end point (6.0 GHz). Frequency labels are placed at 1.0 GHz, 3.6
    GHz, and 6.0 GHz. The title "smith-chart-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The plot uses theme_void() resulting in no axis labels or ticks visible.
    The chart is square (1:1 aspect ratio) and the Smith chart circle fills a reasonable
    portion of the canvas.

        comment: Uses theme_void() so no axis labels present; however, this is appropriate
          for Smith charts which typically have no traditional axes
