review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title formatting matching the required spec format
  - Clean realistic data scenario with CPU usage showing daily cycles and anomalies
  - Good implementation of core interactive features (zoom, crosshair, tooltips)
  - Proper colorblind-safe color choice (#306998)
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Appropriate font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Missing Highcharts navigator/range selector which would enhance interactivity
    for time series
  - Legend marker at bottom is quite small
  - Uses raw dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python wrapper classes
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive line chart showing server CPU
    usage over 7 days of hourly data. The title "line-interactive · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle explaining
    the zoom functionality. The main chart area shows a blue (#306998) line tracing
    CPU usage percentage (Y-axis, 0-106%) against date/time (X-axis, Jan 01-08). The
    line exhibits clear daily cyclical patterns with peaks around 55-65% and troughs
    around 10-30%, along with visible spikes (anomalies) reaching up to ~73%. The
    Y-axis has percentage labels, and the X-axis shows daily date labels. A legend
    "CPU Usage" appears at the bottom center. The overall layout has a clean white
    background with subtle gray grid lines.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1), but legend is placed at bottom which
          is acceptable. However, the legend marker is very small and could be more
          visible.

          While functional, the library docs recommend the Python wrapper.

        comment: Uses Highcharts's native zoom, crosshair, datetime formatting, and
          interactive HTML export. However, does not use range selector or navigator
          which are Highcharts's premium interactive features for time series.
  verdict: APPROVED
