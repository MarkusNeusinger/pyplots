review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including reference line at
    y=0, LOWESS trend line, and transparent points
  - Clean grammar of graphics syntax with proper layering (hline → smooth → points)
  - Symmetric y-axis implementation as recommended in spec
  - Realistic data generation with heteroscedasticity pattern and outliers for diagnostic
    demonstration
  - Proper font sizing and theme customization for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for generic residuals, units may not be applicable)
  - Grid styling could use slightly higher alpha for better visibility (currently
    0.3)
