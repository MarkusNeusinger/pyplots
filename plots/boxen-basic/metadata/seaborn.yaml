review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of boxen plot ability to reveal distribution shapes in
    large datasets
  - Outstanding data generation showing four distinctly different distributions (normal,
    bimodal, exponential, lognormal)
  - Proper seaborn 0.14+ API usage with hue parameter for palette
  - Clean publication-ready styling with removed spines and subtle grid
  - Realistic server response time scenario perfect for this plot type
  - Appropriate data size (5000 points per group) showcasing boxen plot advantages
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend explaining quantile levels as required by spec
  - Nested boxes for narrow distributions are compressed and hard to distinguish
  image_description: 'The plot displays a boxen (letter-value) plot showing server
    response times across four endpoints: API Gateway, Auth Service, Data Query, and
    File Upload. Each endpoint is represented by a distinct color from a custom palette
    (blue, yellow, blue variant, gray). The boxen plots show nested boxes that decrease
    in width for deeper quantiles, clearly revealing the distribution shape. API Gateway
    shows a right-skewed distribution with occasional high spikes (up to ~500ms).
    Auth Service has a very tight, symmetric distribution centered around 80ms. Data
    Query shows a bimodal pattern visible in the nested boxes. File Upload displays
    a heavily right-skewed lognormal distribution with outliers extending to ~3200ms.
    Outliers are displayed as individual circle markers above the main boxen structures.
    The title "boxen-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the
    top in bold. Axes are clearly labeled with "Endpoint" on x-axis and "Response
    Time (ms)" on y-axis with appropriate font sizes. A subtle dashed grid is visible
    on the y-axis with alpha=0.3. Top and right spines have been removed for a cleaner
    appearance.'
