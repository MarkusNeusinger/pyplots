review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ggplot2 grammar with geom_ribbon for confidence band
  - Widening confidence interval effectively demonstrates forecast uncertainty growth
    over time
  - Good color scheme with contrasting yellow points on blue line
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate text sizing for high-resolution output (scale=3)
  - Realistic monthly sales forecast scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the central line and confidence band (spec explicitly
    requires this)
  - Grid lines render with dark outline on the confidence band edge rather than being
    purely subtle
