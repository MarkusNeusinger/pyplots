review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stem plot implementation using Plotly graph_objects with clear vertical
    stems and circular markers
  - Well-designed hover template showing sample index and amplitude with 3 decimal
    precision
  - Good use of signal processing context (damped oscillation) that demonstrates stem
    plot purpose
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Appropriate marker sizing (16px) with white border for visibility against stems
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use Sample Index (n) and Amplitude (a.u.) for dimensionless
    quantities)
  - Grid alpha (0.1) is very subtle, could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3) for
    better readability
  image_description: The plot displays a basic stem plot showing a damped oscillation
    signal with 30 data points. Blue stems (#306998) extend vertically from a dark
    horizontal baseline at y=0 to circular markers at each data value. The markers
    are well-sized with white borders for visibility. Title "stem-basic · plotly ·
    pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. X-axis is labeled "Sample Index" (ranging
    0-30), Y-axis is labeled "Amplitude" (ranging approximately -0.8 to 1.0). The
    plot uses a clean white background (plotly_white template) with subtle gray gridlines.
    The data shows the characteristic decay pattern of a damped cosine wave with small
    random noise, demonstrating both positive and negative amplitude values.
