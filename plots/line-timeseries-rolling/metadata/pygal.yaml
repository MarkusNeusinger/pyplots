review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between raw data (thin blue line) and rolling average
    (thick orange line) following spec guidance
  - Proper handling of rolling average with None values for first 6 days (pygal renders
    this as gaps correctly)
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices with Python Blue and contrasting Orange
  - Legend clearly indicates the 7-day window size as recommended by spec
  - Well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas with custom Style
  - Clean bi-weekly x-axis labeling prevents crowding
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility could be improved - x-axis guides are disabled (show_x_guides=False)
    while spec suggests grid lines on both axes improve readability
  - Font sizes in custom_style are larger than pygal.md guidelines suggest, though
    this works well for the output
