review:
  strengths:
  - Effective workaround for pygal lack of continuous colormap by using discrete temperature
    bins
  - Viridis-inspired colorblind-safe palette with smooth gradient progression
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments explaining the approach
  - Realistic temperature sensor grid scenario with plausible radial temperature pattern
  - Good use of custom Style for appropriate font sizes at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend first bin label includes Temperature: prefix while others do not, creating
    inconsistency'
  - Layout could utilize more canvas space; legend at bottom takes significant real
    estate
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter visualization titled "scatter-color-mapped
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" showing 100 data points representing temperature readings
    across a 100×100 meter sensor grid. The X-axis is labeled "Grid X Position (meters)"
    and Y-axis "Grid Y Position (meters)". Points are colored using a viridis-inspired
    palette spanning 8 temperature bins from dark purple (13-16°C) to yellow (32-35°C).
    The visualization clearly demonstrates a radial temperature pattern with warmer
    temperatures (yellow/green points: 26-35°C) concentrated toward the center of
    the grid and cooler temperatures (purple/blue points: 13-24°C) at the periphery.
    The legend at the bottom displays all 8 temperature ranges. Grid lines are subtle
    with dashed styling. The plot fills the canvas well with balanced margins.'
