review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bezier curve ribbons create smooth, professional-looking flows between
    categories
  - Good use of proportional ribbon widths to show category counts
  - Clean dark navy category bars with white text provide excellent contrast
  - Realistic e-commerce customer journey scenario
  - Proper title format and well-positioned legend
  - Good canvas utilization and layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - Online (#306998) and Mobile (#4B8BBE) colors are too similar, making it difficult
    to distinguish flows from these channels
  - The color palette should use more distinct colors for all three channels to improve
    visual differentiation
