review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of synchronized crosshair concept for a static library
    using vertical lines and annotations
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized data preparation
  - Good use of plotnine faceting capabilities with ordered categorical for proper
    panel ordering
  - Realistic stock data scenario with correlated metrics (price, volume, RSI)
  - Proper colorblind-safe color scheme with blue lines and red crosshair
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label is generic Value instead of being removed or customized per-facet
    since strip labels already provide metric names
  - RSI value at crosshair position (10.0) is at the extreme low end which may look
    like an error rather than intentional data
  - Line width could be slightly increased for better visibility at the target resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with
    three vertically stacked panels showing stock-like data. The top panel shows "Price
    ($)" ranging from approximately 85-110, the middle panel shows "Volume (M)" ranging
    from 1-3.5 million, and the bottom panel shows "RSI Indicator" ranging from 10-80.
    All three charts display blue line plots (#306998) across a shared x-axis spanning
    January 2024 to October 2024. A red dashed vertical crosshair line runs through
    all three panels at approximately late June 2024. Each panel has a red marker
    point at the crosshair position with a white-filled label showing the value: "$92.89"
    for price, "1.86M" for volume, and "RSI: 10.0" for RSI. The title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold. The layout uses minimal
    styling with subtle grid lines and angled x-axis date labels.'
