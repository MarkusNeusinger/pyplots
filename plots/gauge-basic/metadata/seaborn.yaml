review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of seaborn scatterplot to build gauge arc with dense point markers
  - Excellent colorblind accessibility using seaborn built-in colorblind palette
  - Clean white zone boundary lines for visual separation
  - Prominent value display with appropriate text sizing
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced layout
  - Realistic sales performance context
  weaknesses:
  - Zone labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Needle tip marker (red triangle) adds visual interest but is unconventional for
    gauge charts
