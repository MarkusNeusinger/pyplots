review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent compositional layout using vconcat/hconcat for proper marginal plot
    arrangement
  - Good use of shared axis domains ensuring perfect alignment between scatter and
    marginals
  - Interactive brush selection on scatter points with tooltips enhance user experience
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate marker size and opacity for 150 data points
  - Consistent color scheme throughout all plot elements
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid on the main scatter plot (spec mentions revealing density
    patterns)
  - Brush selection is decorative - does not filter/update marginal histograms (missed
    opportunity for linked interactivity)
  - Right marginal histogram shows Y-axis tick labels which creates slight visual
    redundancy
