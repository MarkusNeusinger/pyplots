review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized nodes and clearly visible directed arrows
  - Smart use of curved edges (arc3,rad=0.1) to prevent arrow overlap on bidirectional-style
    edges
  - Edge weight visualization through both line thickness and alpha transparency creates
    good visual hierarchy
  - Proper title format and professional layout with light background
  - Realistic software module dependency scenario with meaningful groupings
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows module types but edge weight legend (Weak/Strong) mentioned in code
    may not be rendering in final image
  - Node label font size at 14pt is acceptable but 16pt would improve readability
    at full resolution
