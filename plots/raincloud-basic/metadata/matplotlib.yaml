review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud visual metaphor with cloud (half-violin)
    on top, boxplot in middle, and rain (jittered points) below
  - Manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule demonstrates solid understanding
    of the underlying statistics
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment A clearly visible, showcasing the key advantage
    of raincloud plots over boxplots
  - Clean, readable code structure with helpful comments
  - Appropriate color choices that are accessible and visually distinct
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is redundant since the y-axis already shows category labels; consider removing
    legend or making it show components (cloud, boxplot, rain) instead
  - Could leverage scipy.stats.gaussian_kde for cleaner KDE implementation rather
    than manual calculation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud visualization for three
    experimental conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) showing reaction times
    in milliseconds. Each condition has three elements arranged vertically: a half-violin
    density curve (cloud) in the upper region colored blue (#306998) for Control,
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Treatment A, and green (#4CAF50) for Treatment B; a white
    boxplot with dark gray borders in the middle showing median, quartiles, and whiskers;
    and jittered scatter points (rain) below each boxplot with the same colors as
    their respective clouds. The x-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from ~175
    to 550ms, and the y-axis shows "Experimental Condition" with the three category
    labels. The title reads "raincloud-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct
    format. A legend is positioned outside the plot area on the upper right. The bimodal
    distribution of Treatment A is clearly visible in its cloud, and Treatment B shows
    outliers extending toward 500ms.'
