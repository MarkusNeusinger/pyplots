review:
  strengths:
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all required box plot features (median, quartiles, whiskers,
    outliers, per-category colors) are present and correct'
  - 'Excellent data quality: realistic salary scenario with intentional outliers and
    varying distribution spreads'
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Good use of pygal-specific features (tukey box mode, legend bottom columns, dual
    SVG+PNG output)
  - Colorblind-safe palette selection
  weaknesses:
  - Box fill colors appear extremely washed-out/pastel, reducing visual impact and
    making distributions harder to distinguish at a glance
  - Outlier dots are too small to be easily visible at the rendered resolution
  - Y-axis starts at 0 which wastes significant vertical space and compresses the
    data range where all the interesting variation occurs
  - No annotations or storytelling elements — the plot displays data without guiding
    the viewer to any insights
  - No category labels directly beneath each box (only identifiable via bottom legend),
    which makes the chart harder to read than necessary
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    showing salary distributions across departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales,
    Operations, HR). Each box uses a distinctly different pastel/light color: light
    blue for Engineering, light yellow-orange for Marketing, light green-teal for
    Sales, light peach-orange for Operations, and light lavender-purple for HR. The
    title "box-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in dark gray
    text. The Y-axis is labeled "Salary ($)" and ranges from 0 to ~135,000. The X-axis
    is labeled "Department" at the bottom. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows
    all 5 department names with matching color swatches. Median lines are visible
    within each box, whiskers extend to show the data range, and outlier points appear
    as small dots beyond the whiskers (notably for Engineering at ~135,000 and ~45,000,
    and for Sales at ~120,000 and ~25,000). The background is white with very subtle
    dotted horizontal grid lines. The boxes appear quite washed-out/pastel due to
    the opacity rendering, and the Y-axis starting at 0 compresses the data into the
    upper portion of the chart, leaving significant unused vertical space.'
