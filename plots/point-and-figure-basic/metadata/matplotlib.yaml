review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent P&F algorithm implementation correctly handling box sizes and 3-box
    reversals
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of X-axis representing columns/reversals rather than time (key P&F
    feature)
  - Good color choices with blue for bullish and red for bearish
  - Grid lines aligned with box size intervals as recommended in spec
  - Appropriate text sizing for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Missing support/resistance trend lines mentioned in spec notes (45-degree lines
    connecting ascending lows/descending highs)
  - Legend marker style does not perfectly match the text characters displayed on
    chart
  image_description: The plot displays a Point and Figure (P&F) chart showing price
    movements over 13 columns (0-12). The chart uses blue "X" characters for rising
    price columns (bullish) and red "O" characters for falling price columns (bearish).
    The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately $80 to $132 with grid
    lines at $2 intervals (matching the box size). The X-axis shows "Column (Reversal
    Number)" from 0 to 12. The title correctly follows the format "point-and-figure-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left shows "Rising (X)" in blue
    and "Falling (O)" in red. The chart demonstrates alternating X and O columns showing
    price reversals, with an overall upward trend visible as prices rise from ~$100
    to ~$127 by the end.
