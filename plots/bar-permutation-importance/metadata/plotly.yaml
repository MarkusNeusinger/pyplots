review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear color gradient distinguishing importance
    levels
  - Error bars implemented correctly with appropriate styling (semi-transparent, proper
    width)
  - Clean professional appearance with white background and subtle grid
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output (good use of Plotly dual-output
    capability)
  - Data represents a realistic ML feature importance scenario with weather features
  - Proper handling of negative importance values with reference line at x=0
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include units or more context (e.g., Mean Decrease in R² Score)
  - Color gradient could use a more standard colormap name for clarity in code
  - Could add annotations for the top features to enhance information density
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing permutation
    feature importance for 15 weather/environmental features. The bars are sorted
    by importance with "Temperature" at the top (highest importance ~0.245) down to
    "Time of Day" at the bottom (negative importance ~-0.008). A sequential color
    gradient transitions from dark teal/blue (low importance) to yellow (high importance).
    Each bar has horizontal error bars showing standard deviation. A dashed vertical
    reference line at x=0 distinguishes positive from negative importance values.
    The title reads "bar-permutation-importance · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at
    the top. X-axis is labeled "Mean Decrease in Model Score" and Y-axis is labeled
    "Feature". The background is clean white with subtle gridlines.

        comment: Uses `go.Bar` with `error_x`, `add_vline`, custom hover template;
          could leverage more Plotly-specific features like annotations or subplot
          capabilities
