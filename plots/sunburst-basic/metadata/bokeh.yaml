review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear color gradients showing parent-child
    relationships
  - Well-designed legend showing department colors and budget totals
  - Clean visual separation between rings using white borders
  - Correct proportional representation where parent segments encompass children angular
    span
  - Ring level labels (Dept, Team, Project) provide helpful context
  - Good use of Label components for annotation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing hover tooltips which would be valuable for a Bokeh sunburst to show exact
    values
  - Some outer ring labels are truncated (e.g., Infra instead of Infrastructure)
  - Colorblind accessibility could be improved - red (Sales) and green (Operations)
    are adjacent
  - Level 1 labels use 3-character abbreviations that may not be immediately clear
