review:
  strengths:
  - Perfectly implements the chess board standard with light square at h1 corner
  - Excellent color scheme using classic brown/cream that is visually appealing and
    accessible
  - Clean use of seaborn heatmap with square=True for proper aspect ratio
  - Border lines between squares enhance visual clarity
  - Well-formatted title following the required convention
  - Appropriate axis labels using chess terminology (File, Rank)
  weaknesses:
  - VQ-07 grid/legend scoring does not cleanly apply to this visualization type
  image_description: The plot displays a classic 8x8 chessboard with alternating brown
    (#8B4513, saddle brown) and cream (#F5DEB3, wheat) squares. The board uses standard
    algebraic notation with columns labeled a-h at the bottom (labeled "File") and
    rows labeled 1-8 on the left side (labeled "Rank"). The title "chessboard-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large 28pt font. Dark brown (#5D3A1A)
    border lines separate each square with linewidth=2, providing clear visual separation.
    The board maintains a perfect 1:1 square aspect ratio using seaborn's square=True
    parameter. Critically, the h1 square (bottom-right corner) is light/cream colored,
    which correctly follows the chess standard that "white on right." The a8 square
    (top-left) is also light, as expected. The overall layout is well-balanced with
    the chessboard filling the canvas appropriately.
