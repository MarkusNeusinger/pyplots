review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of OSM-inspired color scheme to simulate map appearance
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good data quality with real European landmarks and realistic visitor statistics
  - Effective use of marker size encoding for visitor count ranges
  - Proper axis labeling with geographic degree notation
  weaknesses:
  - 'Fundamental spec mismatch: Pygal cannot render actual tile-based map backgrounds
    (OpenStreetMap, Stamen, satellite imagery) as required by the specification'
  - Missing tile provider attribution as required by specification
  - Title format includes descriptive prefix instead of using spec-id directly
  - Legend colors are subtle variations of blue that could be more distinguishable
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart of 15 European landmarks plotted
    by geographic coordinates (longitude on X-axis from -2° to 22°, latitude on Y-axis
    from 36° to 54°). The visualization uses OSM-inspired colors: a light blue/teal
    outer background (#aad3df) representing ocean and a beige/cream inner plot area
    (#f2efe9) representing land. Data points are rendered in three shades of blue
    with varying marker sizes corresponding to visitor count ranges: small dots for
    1,300K-2,999K visitors/year, medium for 3,000K-5,999K, and large for 6,000K-9,600K.
    The title correctly follows the format "European Landmarks · map-tile-background
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". Axis labels include units (degrees North, degrees East/West)
    with degree notation on ticks. A legend at the bottom identifies the three visitor
    categories. Notable landmark clusters appear around Paris (Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame,
    Louvre) and Amsterdam (Anne Frank House, Rijksmuseum).'
