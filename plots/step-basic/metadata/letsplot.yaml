review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_step with hv direction parameter creating proper stair-step
    visualization
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper layering (step + points)
  - Perfect title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good color choices with Python blue and yellow for brand consistency
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 output with scaled export
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that matches spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses dashed lines which can appear busy; solid subtle lines may be
    cleaner
  - Markers could be slightly larger (size=6-7) for better visibility at the data
    points
