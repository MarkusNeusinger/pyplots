review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of AreaSeries with gradient fill to visually represent the AUC area
    under the ROC curve
  - Clean implementation following the library rules for Highcharts with inline JS
    embedding
  - Proper manual ROC curve calculation demonstrating the algorithm
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (Python Blue and olive yellow)
  - Correctly formatted title following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position causes slight overlap with the x-axis 1 tick label
  - Could leverage Highcharts tooltip feature to show threshold values at each point
    on the curve
  - Example data shows only one high-performing classifier; could include comparison
    with a second model to better demonstrate ROC curve usage
