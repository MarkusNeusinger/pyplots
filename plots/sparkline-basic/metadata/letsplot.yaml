review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent minimalist sparkline design using theme_void() - no axes or gridlines
    as spec requires
  - Good use of ggplot2 grammar with geom_area for subtle fill effect under the line
  - Realistic stock price simulation with appropriate volatility
  - Clean highlighting of first/last/min/max points with distinct colors
  - Proper reproducibility with seed(42)
  - Correct title format and sizing
  weaknesses:
  - 'Poor canvas utilization: sparkline occupies only upper ~25% of the 4800x2700
    canvas, leaving vast empty space below the area fill'
  - The minimum point (red) appears to coincide with or be very close to the last
    point, making it hard to see both distinctly as separate features
  - Aspect ratio could be more sparkline-appropriate (spec suggests 4:1 to 8:1, current
    is closer to 16:9)
