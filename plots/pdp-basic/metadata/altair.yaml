review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including confidence intervals
    and rug plot
  - Clean declarative Altair code using layered composition pattern
  - Proper bootstrap resampling (n=50) for confidence interval calculation
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity
  - Title format exactly matches specification
  - Axis labels are descriptive with units
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what the shaded band represents (confidence interval label
    would improve clarity)
  - Rug plot ticks are somewhat thin and could be more prominent
  - Could add interactive selection or zoom capabilities to better leverage Altair
    strengths
