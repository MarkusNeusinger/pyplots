review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using the project standard colors (Python blue/yellow
    plus complementary hues)
  - Clear regional clustering visible in data - Africa lower-left, Europe upper-right,
    demonstrating realistic economic patterns
  - Proper use of semi-transparency (0.7 opacity) revealing overlapping bubbles
  - Well-structured tooltip showing all three data dimensions with proper formatting
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good bubble sizing with minSize/maxSize constraints preventing overwhelming markers
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears slightly truncated on the right edge - consider increasing
    marginRight or adjusting legend position
  - No explicit size legend showing what bubble sizes represent (spec requests this
    feature)
  - X-axis label GDP per Capita (USD) is not visible - only tick values shown in k
    notation
