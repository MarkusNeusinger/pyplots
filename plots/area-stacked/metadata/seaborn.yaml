review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with harmonious color palette including Python blue as
    primary color
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with good data generation
  - Proper title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal patterns and growth trend
  - Good use of date formatting with rotated labels to prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use distinctive seaborn plot functions - stackplot is a matplotlib function,
    only seaborn styling is applied
  - Legend position overlaps with data area - could be moved outside or use upper
    right
  - Data series all follow similar sinusoidal patterns - more variety in trends would
    better demonstrate stacked area features
