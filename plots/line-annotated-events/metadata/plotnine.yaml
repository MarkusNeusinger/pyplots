review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alternating y-positions for event labels to avoid
    overlap
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach with well-layered geoms (line → vline → point
    → text)
  - 'Appropriate use of the Python color scheme (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow)'
  - Good text sizing following the library guidelines (24pt title, 20pt axis labels,
    16pt ticks)
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with meaningful event annotations
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Daily Visitors (count)")
  - Event markers at alternating heights work well but the fixed y_offset values (0.85,
    0.92) could be slightly higher to give more separation from the data line peaks
  image_description: 'The plot displays a blue line chart showing daily website visitors
    over the year 2024 (January through December). The y-axis ranges from approximately
    40,000 to 55,000 daily visitors. Five vertical dashed yellow lines mark significant
    events, each with a yellow diamond marker positioned at alternating heights (higher/lower)
    to prevent label overlap. The event labels are: "v2.0 Release" (Feb 2024), "Mobile
    App Launch" (May 2024), "API Update" (Jul 2024), "Enterprise Tier" (Oct 2024),
    and "Holiday Campaign" (Dec 2024). The title follows the correct format "line-annotated-events
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai". X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees showing months.
    The overall aesthetic is clean with a minimal theme and subtle gray grid lines.'

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_* layering),
          but doesn't leverage advanced features like faceting or statistical transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
