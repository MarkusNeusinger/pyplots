review:
  strengths:
  - Creative SVG injection approach to implement contour visualization in pygal which
    lacks native support
  - Excellent diverging blue-to-red colormap that is intuitive and colorblind-accessible
  - Well-positioned contour labels with white background boxes for readability
  - Realistic meteorological scenario with multiple temperature anomaly centers over
    Europe
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good geographic context with simplified coastline polygon representations
  weaknesses:
  - Contour lines appear somewhat jagged due to marching squares implementation -
    consider connecting line segments into smoother paths
  - Colorbar temperature labels are small and could be more prominent
  - Grid guides are essentially invisible which makes reading exact coordinates difficult
  - Rectangular cell-based filled contours create a pixelated appearance rather than
    smooth color gradients
  image_description: The plot displays a temperature contour map over a geographic
    region (Europe/Atlantic, approximately -30°E to 50°E longitude, 25°N to 70°N latitude).
    Filled rectangular cells show temperature values using a blue-to-red color gradient,
    with deep blue representing cold temperatures (-4°C) and red representing warm
    temperatures (24°C). A cold center (blue) is visible in the upper-left around
    -10°E, 60°N, while warmer areas (red/orange) dominate the southern and eastern
    regions. Simplified coastline polygons are drawn in dark gray, representing rough
    outlines of Europe, British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, and North Africa. Contour
    lines in dark gray traverse the map showing temperature isolines. Temperature
    labels (e.g., -4°C, 0°C, 4°C, 8°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 24°C) are placed at strategic
    positions with white background boxes. A vertical colorbar on the right shows
    the temperature scale from -4°C to 24°C. The title reads "contour-map-geographic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". Axes are labeled "Longitude (°E)" and "Latitude (°N)".
