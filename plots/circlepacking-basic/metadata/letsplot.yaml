review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm implementation with force-directed simulation
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct color families (blue/yellow/green) for each
    main category
  - Proportional sizing correctly represents storage values
  - White circle outlines effectively separate nested circles
  - Realistic file system scenario with sensible folder structure and GB values
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with geom_polygon for custom circle shapes
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (create_circle_points, pack_circles_in_parent) instead of
    flat KISS structure
  - Some child circle labels (especially in smaller circles) could be slightly larger
    for better readability
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a circle packing chart showing a "Storage Breakdown" visualization. A large dark navy blue root circle contains three main category circles: **Media** (yellow/gold), **Code** (green), and **Documents** (blue). Each parent circle contains nested child circles representing subfolders:
    - **Media** (largest): Contains Videos (largest, pale yellow), Photos, and Music
    - **Code**: Contains Projects (largest), Libraries, and Backups
    - **Documents**: Contains Work, Personal, and Archive

    The circles use white borders/outlines with subtle transparency (alpha ~0.92). Parent category labels ("Media", "Code", "Documents") appear in bold white text, while child labels are in dark gray. The title "Storage Breakdown · circlepacking-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Circle sizes are proportional to storage values. The color scheme uses distinct hues (blue/yellow/green) with lighter shades for children within each category.
