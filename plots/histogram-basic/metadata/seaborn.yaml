review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all specification requirements met with clear bin
    edges, readable labels, appropriate bin count, and y-axis starting at zero
  - Strong code quality — clean KISS structure, reproducible seed, idiomatic seaborn
    usage with axes-level API
  - Good data design — multimodal exam score distribution with three distinct components
    (normal ~72, normal ~90, uniform 30-50) demonstrates histogram capabilities well
  - Proper visual refinement — spine removal, subtle grid, explicit font sizes, white
    edgecolor on bars
  weaknesses:
  - No data storytelling — lacks annotations highlighting key distribution features
    (mean, median, the secondary mode near 90, the low-score tail). Adding statistical
    callouts would elevate the visualization
  - Aesthetic sophistication is average — while clean, the design doesn't reach publication-quality
    level. Could benefit from a more intentional color scheme, typography hierarchy,
    or visual emphasis
  - Layout has minor wasted space — horizontal axis extends well beyond the data range
    on both sides
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of exam scores ranging from approximately
    30 to 110 points, using 30 bins filled with Python Blue (#306998) and white edge
    lines. A smooth KDE (kernel density estimation) curve overlays the bars. The distribution
    is prominently centered around 72–75 with a secondary bump near 88–92, and a low-frequency
    uniform tail between 30–50. The title reads "histogram-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)" and the y-axis "Frequency
    (count)". Top and right spines are removed, and a subtle y-axis grid is present.
    The y-axis starts at 0 and goes up to 50. The layout is clean with good whitespace.
