review:
  strengths:
  - Correct rebasing calculation normalizing all series to 100 at start
  - Good use of custom Style for font sizing and color scheme
  - Realistic simulated stock data with different return characteristics
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear variable naming
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels are not visible in the output despite being configured
  - Missing horizontal reference line at 100 (mentioned as consideration in spec)
  - Legend font size is small relative to the large canvas
  - No use of pygal distinctive interactive features (tooltips, hover effects, value
    display)
  - Color scheme could be more colorblind-friendly (yellow/green combination)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-line chart comparing four stock price
    series (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, and SPY Benchmark) normalized to a starting value of
    100. The chart uses a white background with horizontal grid lines at intervals
    of 10 units. Each series is represented with a distinct color: AAPL in blue (#306998),
    GOOGL in yellow (#FFD43B), MSFT in red (#E74C3C), and SPY in green (#2ECC71).
    The legend appears in the top-left corner showing small color boxes with text
    labels. The y-axis is labeled "Rebased Price (Start = 100)" ranging from approximately
    80 to 170, and the x-axis is labeled "Date" but shows no visible date labels.
    The title "line-stock-comparison · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The lines show realistic stock-like volatility with GOOGL performing best (ending
    around 155), SPY second (ending around 150), AAPL relatively flat (ending around
    115), and MSFT declining (ending around 85).'
