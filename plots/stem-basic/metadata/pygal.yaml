review:
  strengths:
  - Correct stem plot implementation with clear visual separation of each stem
  - Proper decaying oscillation data pattern demonstrating impulse response concept
  - Correct title format and axis labeling
  - Good use of reproducible random seed
  - Clean KISS code structure
  - Appropriate canvas size (4800x2700) with reasonable font scaling
  weaknesses:
  - Stem lines appear different color (cyan) than markers (dark blue) - should be
    consistent
  - Legend shows Baseline label which adds unnecessary clutter
  - Adding 30 individual series is inefficient - could group stems better
  - Axis labels lack units (should be Amplitude (a.u.) or similar)
  - Text could be larger for the high-resolution canvas
