review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual indication of real-time concept with graduated point sizes and
    direction arrow
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with plausible data patterns including spikes
  - Clean layered composition using Altair declarative syntax
  - Prominent latest value annotation makes current reading immediately visible
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - The fade effect is only on point opacity, not the line itself - spec suggests
    trailing edge fade
  - Large empty region in lower portion of chart (0-35%) is visually wasteful
  - Does not demonstrate Altair interactive capabilities (zoom, pan, tooltips) which
    would enhance real-time monitoring
  image_description: The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitor spanning approximately
    10 seconds of data (08:04:55 to 08:05:05). A blue line (#306998) traces CPU usage
    percentage over time with graduated circular markers that increase in size from
    left to right, creating a visual "trail" effect where newer data appears more
    prominent. The Y-axis shows "CPU Usage (%)" ranging from 0-100, and the X-axis
    shows "Time" with timestamps formatted as HH:MM:SS. The data shows realistic CPU
    behavior with a baseline around 35-50%, notable spikes reaching ~77% and ~60%,
    and the most recent reading at 39.8%. The latest data point is highlighted with
    a yellow marker (#FFD43B) with a bold "39.8%" annotation beside it. An orange
    play/arrow symbol (▶) near the right edge indicates the scrolling direction, and
    gray italic text "← older data fades out" in the upper left explains the trailing
    effect. The title "Server CPU Monitor · line-realtime · altair · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top.

        comment: Uses Altair layering with multiple Chart objects, Size/Opacity encoding
          for gradient effect. Could leverage more interactive features.
