review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_segment to create horizontal bars sorted within each cluster,
    producing the characteristic silhouette shape
  - Clear cluster annotations with average scores positioned appropriately on the
    left side
  - Well-implemented dashed vertical line showing overall average silhouette score
    with label
  - Uses realistic Iris dataset which is a classic clustering example
  - Good color scheme with Python branding colors that are also colorblind-friendly
  - Proper ggplot2 grammar style with theme customization for clean appearance
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis extends to -0.3 but no negative silhouette values exist in the data, creating
    unnecessary whitespace
  - Legend is somewhat redundant since cluster labels are already annotated directly
    on the plot
  - The Iris dataset with 3 clusters produces all positive silhouette values; showing
    some negative values would better demonstrate the plot ability to highlight potential
    misclassifications
