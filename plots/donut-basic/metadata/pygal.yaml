review:
  strengths:
  - Clean donut chart implementation with proper inner_radius creating the hollow
    center
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing at high resolution
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with meaningful category names
  - Percentage labels displayed directly on segments for easy reading
  - Well-organized legend at bottom avoiding chart overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests using center space for key metric or label, but center is empty
  - Two pairs of similar colors (blues and yellows) reduce distinguishability between
    segments
  - Does not showcase pygal interactive/tooltip capabilities
