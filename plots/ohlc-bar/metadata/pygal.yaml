review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to OHLC visualization using pygal XY chart with line segments
  - Proper color differentiation between up (green) and down (red) bars
  - Realistic stock price data with good variety of bullish and bearish periods
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate canvas sizing (4800x2700) and font sizes for readability
  - Grid lines help read exact price levels as specified
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows numeric trading day index instead of actual dates despite generating
    date_range
  - OHLC tick marks (open/close horizontal lines) could be more visually prominent
  - Legend labels could better explain what the colors represent
  - Grid styling could be more subtle
  image_description: The plot displays an OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) bar chart showing
    40 trading days of stock price data. Each bar consists of a vertical line (high-low
    range) with horizontal tick marks extending left for open price and right for
    close price. Green bars indicate bullish days (close ≥ open) and red bars indicate
    bearish days (close < open). The price ranges from approximately $130 to $166,
    showing an overall downward trend with volatility. The title "ohlc-bar · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Axes are labeled "Trading Day" (x-axis,
    numeric 0-36) and "Price ($)" (y-axis). A legend at the bottom shows "Up (Close
    ≥ Open)" in green and "Down (Close < Open)" in red. Light gray grid lines are
    visible in the background.
