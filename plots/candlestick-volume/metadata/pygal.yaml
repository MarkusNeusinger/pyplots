review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of pygal secondary axis feature for volume overlay
  - Descriptive axis labels with units (Price ($), Trading Day)
  - Realistic 60-day stock price data generation with volume correlation to volatility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Not a candlestick chart - Uses line chart instead of candlesticks;
    pygal lacks native candlestick support but Box chart or custom implementation
    could approximate OHLC bars'
  - Missing dual-pane layout - Spec requires 70-75% price / 25-30% volume split; current
    implementation overlays volume which obscures price data
  - Volume area too dominant - Gray filled area covers entire chart height making
    it hard to read price lines in lower portions
  - Missing up/down color scheme - Candlesticks should use green/red (or similar)
    for bullish/bearish days; volume bars should match
  - Missing crosshair feature - Spec requires crosshair spanning both panes for precise
    reading (interactive feature)
