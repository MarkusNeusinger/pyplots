review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data visualization with clear company org chart context
  - Custom force-directed circle packing algorithm provides authentic bubble nesting
  - Python-themed color scheme (blue/yellow) creates visual identity
  - Square format is perfect choice for radially symmetric visualization
  - Labels adapt font size to circle radius, improving readability
  - Legend clearly explains depth-based color coding
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses functions/classes instead of flat KISS structure required by guidelines
  - Title format should be exactly "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" without prefix
  - Some child circles slightly extend beyond parent boundaries due to packing algorithm
    tolerance
  - Legend patch colors do not exactly match the rendered colors (Teams patch shows
    same blue as root)
