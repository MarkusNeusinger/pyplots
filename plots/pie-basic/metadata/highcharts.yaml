  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with computed subtitle insight (Top 3 control 67%)
    and italic callout for AWS dominance
  - Visually polished with shadow effects, white slice borders, and crookedLine connectors
  - All spec requirements met perfectly (percentages, legend, distinct colors, exploded
    slice)
  - Realistic and neutral data context with appropriate values
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features (states, softConnector, slicedOffset,
    useHTML)
  - Dual output (interactive HTML + static PNG) demonstrates library capability
  weaknesses:
  - Minor whitespace gap between subtitle and pie chart top could be tightened
  - Alibaba slice at 4% is quite thin — could benefit from slightly more visual emphasis
  - Legend symbols (circles) at the bottom are relatively small compared to the label
    text size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "Cloud Infrastructure Market
    Share · pie-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at 4800x2700 px on a white background.
    Five slices represent cloud providers: AWS (31.0%, dark blue #306998) is the largest
    and exploded outward for emphasis; Azure (25.0%, yellow #FFD43B) is the second
    largest; Others (29.0%, purple #9467BD) is a large aggregated slice; Google Cloud
    (11.0%, salmon/orange #E07B54) is mid-sized; and Alibaba (4.0%, teal #2CA089)
    is the smallest. Data labels outside each slice show the provider name in bold
    and percentage, connected by subtle crookedLine connectors. A subtitle reads "Global
    cloud spending by provider, 2024 — Top 3 providers control 67% of the market"
    with an italicized insight line "AWS leads with nearly 1/3 of global cloud revenue."
    A horizontal legend at the bottom lists all five categories with colored circle
    symbols. White borders separate slices, and subtle shadows add depth.'
