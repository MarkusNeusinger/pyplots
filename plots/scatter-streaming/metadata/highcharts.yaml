review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the streaming scatter concept using opacity to encode
    data recency
  - Realistic sensor data scenario (temperature vs humidity) directly from spec examples
  - Clean, well-structured code following highcharts library best practices
  - Proper use of ScatterSeries with grouped data for visual distinction
  - Good visual design with appropriate font sizing and colorblind-safe palette
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output as expected for interactive library
  weaknesses:
  - The opacity differences between the four groups are subtle - could use a wider
    opacity range (e.g., 0.1 to 1.0 instead of 0.2 to 1.0) for clearer visual distinction
  - Data clustering on the left side of the plot due to random walk pattern - could
    adjust random walk parameters for better spread
  - Marker stroke (lineColor) is the same for all groups, reducing the visual distinction
    between recency levels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot of sensor readings with Temperature
    (°C) on the x-axis ranging from approximately 17.9°C to 23.3°C, and Humidity (%)
    on the y-axis ranging from 50% to 82%. The chart shows 150 data points grouped
    into four series by opacity level: "Oldest readings" (most transparent), "Older
    readings", "Recent readings", and "Latest readings" (most opaque). All points
    use a consistent blue color (#306998) with varying transparency to indicate data
    recency. The title "scatter-streaming · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top with a subtitle explaining the opacity encoding. The legend is positioned
    in the upper right corner with a white background. Grid lines are subtle gray.
    The data shows an inverse correlation between temperature and humidity, with a
    random walk pattern representing streaming sensor data.'

        comment: Markers are visible with good size (radius 14). However, the opacity
          gradient could be more distinct - the differences between the four groups
          are subtle.
