review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of animated plot as static faceted view showing key time
    points
  - Clean Gapminder-style visualization with appropriate data context
  - Good use of seaborn FacetGrid for multi-panel layout
  - White letter labels inside bubbles provide clear region identification
  - Custom color palette with good visual appeal
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement overlaps with the 2010 panel edge, could be positioned better
  - Year display could be more prominent (spec mentions large text in background or
    corner for current time)
  - Font sizes could be increased slightly for optimal 4800px rendering
  - All regions follow very similar growth trajectories, reducing feature coverage
