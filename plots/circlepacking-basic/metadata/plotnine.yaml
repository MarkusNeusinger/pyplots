review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear color differentiation between levels (gray
    root, blue departments, yellow teams)
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to draw circles since plotnine lacks
    native circle packing
  - Proper area encoding (r ∝ sqrt(value)) for accurate visual perception of sizes
  - Clean, readable code with well-documented manual layout calculations
  - Realistic company organizational data that effectively demonstrates the visualization
    concept
  - All labels readable with appropriate sizing and bold text for emphasis
  weaknesses:
  - Manual circle positioning rather than algorithmic packing means circles do not
    pack as tightly as possible
  - Slight empty space at bottom of the root circle could be better utilized
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circle packing chart representing a company
    organizational structure. A large light gray root circle (labeled "Root" in legend)
    encompasses the entire visualization. Inside it are three medium-sized blue circles
    representing departments: Engineering (top center, largest), Operations (bottom
    left), and Product (bottom right). Each department contains smaller yellow circles
    representing teams: Engineering has Backend, Frontend, and DevOps; Operations
    has Finance, Legal, and HR; Product has Design, PM, and Research. The title "circlepacking-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. A horizontal legend
    at the bottom shows the hierarchy levels with colored squares: Root (gray), Departments
    (blue), and Teams (yellow). Circle sizes correctly reflect the hierarchical values
    with Engineering being the largest department.'
