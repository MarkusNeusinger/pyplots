review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation using geom_segment for wicks and geom_rect for bodies
    - creative use of plotnine grammar
  - Clean readable code with proper KISS structure
  - Realistic stock price simulation with random walk model
  - Good visual styling with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red color scheme is standard for finance but not colorblind-accessible;
    consider using blue/orange or shapes
  - X-axis shows numeric Trading Day instead of actual dates which would be more informative
