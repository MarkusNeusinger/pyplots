review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between all three
    groups
  - Proper implementation of stacked histogram using common bin edges calculated from
    combined data
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-sized text elements for high-resolution
    output
  - Correct title format and meaningful subtitle adding context
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like plot_options stacking configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Output image height is 2561px instead of the expected 2700px (minor dimension
    mismatch)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could be "Measurement Range (units)" and "Frequency
    (count)")
  image_description: The plot displays a stacked column chart representing measurement
    distributions across three sensor types. The visualization uses 15 bins spanning
    from 14-97 on the x-axis ("Measurement Range"). Blue bars represent Sensor A (centered
    around higher values ~45-55), yellow bars represent Sensor B (centered ~55-65),
    and purple bars represent Sensor C (centered ~65-75). The stacked bars clearly
    show combined frequencies reaching up to ~57 at the peak (52-58 bin). The title
    "histogram-stacked · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears prominently at the top with
    a subtitle "Measurement Distribution by Sensor Type". A vertical legend is positioned
    in the top-right corner. The layout is clean with good use of white space and
    subtle grid lines.
