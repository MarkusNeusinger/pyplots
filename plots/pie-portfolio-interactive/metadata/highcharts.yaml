review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts drill-down functionality with complete sub-holdings
    data
  - Colorblind-safe palette following library guidelines
  - Proper title format and helpful subtitle guiding user interaction
  - Clean donut chart with good proportions (50% inner size)
  - Accessibility module included for screen reader support
  - Well-structured drill-down data for all four asset classes
  - Interactive HTML also generated for full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned at the far right edge, creating some visual imbalance
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive donut chart showing portfolio
    allocation across four asset classes. The chart uses a colorblind-safe palette
    with blue (#306998) for Equities (55.0%), yellow (#FFD43B) for Fixed Income (25.0%),
    purple (#9467BD) for Alternatives (12.0%), and cyan (#17BECF) for Cash (8.0%).
    The donut has a 50% inner radius creating a clean ring visualization. Data labels
    are positioned outside each slice showing category name and percentage. A vertical
    legend on the right side lists all four categories with colored markers. The title
    "pie-portfolio-interactive · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with
    a subtitle "Click slices to view individual holdings" below it. The chart fills
    a good portion of the canvas with balanced white space.
