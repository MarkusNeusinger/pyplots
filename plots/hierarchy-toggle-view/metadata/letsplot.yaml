review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot gggrid for side-by-side layout
  - Full interactive HTML with working toggle button and canvas rendering
  - Consistent color mapping between both views
  - Squarify algorithm implemented inline without external dependency
  - Clean code structure with comprehensive theming
  weaknesses:
  - Sunburst shows only leaf nodes as single ring rather than concentric rings showing
    hierarchy depth
  - Some label overlap in sunburst view near smaller segments
  - Treemap shows only leaf-level rectangles, not nested parent containers
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a side-by-side comparison of two hierarchical visualizations of company budget allocation data. On the left is a Treemap View showing nested rectangles with areas proportional to budget values. The treemap uses a squarify algorithm with white borders (2.5pt) separating segments. Colors are category-based: yellows/golds (Sales: North 13%, South 10%, East 8%), blues (Engineering: API Core 8%, Web App 8%, Analytics 7%, Mobile 5%, Infra 6%, Monitoring), greens (Marketing: Digital 11%, Brand 8%), and pinks/coral (Operations: Facilities 7%, Logistics 5%). Labels show names and percentages in white bold text.

    On the right is a Sunburst View showing the same data as a donut-style radial chart. Segments span from an inner radius (~25%) to outer radius, with the same color mapping. Labels are placed at segment midpoints in dark gray. Some label overlap is visible near smaller segments.

    The main title "hierarchy-toggle-view · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at top center in bold, with subtitle "Company Budget Allocation · Toggle between views in HTML (interactive)" below. The overall layout is 1600x900 (scaled 3x for 4800x2700).
