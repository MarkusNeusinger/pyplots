review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of circular vortex streamlines with smooth, well-distributed
    curves
  - Color encoding effectively communicates velocity magnitude (increasing with radius)
  - Clean code structure with well-commented Euler integration for streamline tracing
  - Good use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for this radially symmetric visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels missing units ("X Position" and "Y Position" should be "X Position
    (m)" and "Y Position (m)" to match the colorbar units)
  - Uses seaborn primarily for styling rather than its distinctive statistical plotting
    features
