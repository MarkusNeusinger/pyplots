review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent grouped box plot with clear visual separation between experience levels
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal)
  - 'Data shows meaningful variation: Junior employees have wider distributions, Senior
    more consistent'
  - Outliers properly displayed and styled with matching colors
  - Clean, readable KISS-style code with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper left could potentially overlap with high outliers; upper
    right might be safer
  - Data pattern is quite uniform across departments (all show same Junior<Mid<Senior
    progression) - more inter-department variation would be more interesting
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like notched boxes to show confidence intervals
