review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pd.Categorical for logical ordering of response categories instead
    of alphabetical
  - Clean implementation of count labels using geom_text with proper positioning
  - Custom color palette transitions well from blue (positive) to yellow (negative)
    matching sentiment
  - Perfect adherence to KISS code structure with clear section organization
  - Appropriate use of theme_minimal with customized element_text sizing for high-resolution
    output
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Yellow bar color (#FFD43B) on white background has slightly reduced contrast
    compared to blue bars'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing customer survey
    responses. Five bars represent response categories from left to right: "Excellent"
    (45, dark blue), "Good" (78, medium blue), "Average" (52, lighter blue), "Poor"
    (23, pale blue), and "Very Poor" (12, yellow/gold). Each bar has its count value
    displayed above it. The title "count-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. The x-axis is labeled "Customer Response" and the y-axis "Number of Responses".
    The background is clean white with subtle horizontal grid lines, using theme_minimal
    styling.'
