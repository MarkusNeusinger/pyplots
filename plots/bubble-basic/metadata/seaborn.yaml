review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data context (GDP vs life expectancy vs population) with plausible
    ranges
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with proper seed and all explicitly
    set font sizes
  - Good use of seaborn size parameter for bubble mapping with appropriate alpha and
    white edge highlights
  - 'Professional visual styling: spine removal, subtle y-grid, Python Blue color'
  weaknesses:
  - Size legend in upper-left overlaps with data points in the low-GDP/high-life-expectancy
    cluster, reducing readability
  - No visual storytelling emphasis — the correlation trend is visible but nothing
    guides the viewer to a specific insight (e.g., highlighted outliers, trend line,
    or regional grouping via color)
  - Extensive manual matplotlib legend customization reduces seaborn API advantage;
    consider using seaborn built-in legend handling more effectively
  - Smallest bubbles are quite small relative to the canvas, making some low-population
    data points harder to distinguish
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with 40 data points on a 16:9
    landscape canvas. The x-axis shows "GDP per Capita ($ thousands)" ranging from
    roughly 5 to 85, and the y-axis shows "Life Expectancy (years)" ranging from about
    58 to 84. All bubbles are rendered in a muted steel-blue color (#306998) with
    white edges and moderate transparency (alpha ~0.55). Bubble sizes vary substantially
    — from small dots representing cities under 5M population to large circles for
    cities around 30M. A size legend in the upper-left corner displays reference bubbles
    for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 million population. The title reads "bubble-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in medium weight. Top and right spines are removed, and
    a subtle horizontal y-axis grid (alpha=0.2) provides reference lines. The data
    shows a clear positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy,
    with natural scatter. The overall aesthetic is clean and professional.

        comment: size/sizes tuple and legend=brief are seaborn-specific; extensive
