review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and data elements
  - Clear demonstration of asymmetric error bars with larger downside risk
  - Good use of caption to explain what the error bars represent (as spec recommends)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial forecasting scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Error bar asymmetry pattern is uniform (all bars have larger downside) - mixing
    in some with larger upside would better demonstrate the concept
  - 'Grid/legend scoring: caption is good but a proper legend entry could enhance
    clarity'
