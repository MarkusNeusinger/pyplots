review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style animated visualization with all required
    interactive controls
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas with clear hierarchy
  - Color palette is distinctive and colorblind-friendly with good contrast
  - Year watermark provides clear temporal context without obscuring data
  - Smooth animation implementation using CustomJS with proper play/pause toggle
  - Hover tooltips provide detailed information for each country
  - PNG snapshot shows middle frame (2014) as representative static view
  weaknesses:
  - Legend glyph sizes (60px) appear small compared to actual bubble sizes in the
    plot, making it harder to associate legend entries with data points
  - Grid styling with dashed lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha 0.2 instead
    of 0.3)
