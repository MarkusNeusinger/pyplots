review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen line widths and colors that make all
    curves easily distinguishable
  - Perfect implementation of the gain curve concept with all three required curves
    (model, perfect, baseline)
  - Strong adherence to plotnine grammar of graphics approach with clean layered construction
  - Realistic marketing response model context that demonstrates practical application
  - Proper axis scaling and labeling with units in percentage format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title Curve is generic; consider removing the legend title or using more
    descriptive text
  - The variable n_samples is redefined at line 49 (shadowing the earlier definition
    at line 27)
  - Could benefit from annotation showing key metrics like the area under the curve
    or lift at specific percentiles
