review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizes matching matplotlib.md guidelines
  - Clean seasonal temperature data creates a realistic, easy-to-understand example
  - Dual-color marker design (yellow fill, blue edge) provides attractive visual distinction
  - Proper use of Axes methods (ax.plot, ax.set_*) rather than pyplot functions
  - Correct title format matching spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Data is quite smooth; adding slightly more random variation could better demonstrate
    how line plots handle noisy data
  - Could use additional matplotlib features like fill_between for confidence intervals
    or ax.annotate for peak/trough labeling to score higher on library features
