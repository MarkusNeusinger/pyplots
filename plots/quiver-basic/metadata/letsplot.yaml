review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular rotation pattern clearly demonstrates the vector field concept
  - Color encoding of magnitude (blue=low, yellow=high) provides additional insight
    as suggested in spec
  - Well-scaled arrows that prevent overlap while remaining visible
  - Proper use of geom_segment with arrow() to simulate quiver functionality
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "X Position (units)" or context like "meters")
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha slightly lower)
  - Could explore additional lets-plot interactive features for the HTML output
