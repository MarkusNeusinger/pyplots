review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stem plot using Altair declarative approach with layered
    marks (baseline + stems + markers)
  - Creative use of mark_rule with y/y2 encoding to create stems from baseline to
    data points
  - Good marker visibility with white stroke providing contrast against stems
  - Interactive tooltips showing sample index and amplitude values
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate data representing a damped oscillation signal with clear visual decay
    pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Amplitude (a.u.) or Sample Index (n))
  - Data scenario could be more specific (e.g., audio sample, ECG signal) rather than
    generic damped oscillation
  image_description: The plot displays a basic stem plot representing a damped oscillation
    signal with 30 data points. Blue circular markers are positioned at each data
    value, connected by thin blue vertical lines (stems) extending down to a black
    horizontal baseline at y=0. The stems are rendered in a pleasant blue color (#306998)
    with white-stroked circular markers at their tips. The title "stem-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The x-axis is labeled "Sample Index"
    ranging from 0 to 30, and the y-axis is labeled "Amplitude" ranging from approximately
    -0.8 to 1.2. A subtle dashed grid (alpha 0.3) provides visual reference. The damped
    oscillation pattern is clearly visible, starting with high amplitude at index
    0 (~1.0) and decaying toward zero with oscillating positive and negative values.
