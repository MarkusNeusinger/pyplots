review:
  strengths:
  - 'Successfully addressed both issues from attempt 2: switched to perceptually uniform
    inferno colormap (fixing SC-02 and VQ-04) while maintaining strong design identity'
  - Warm beige background with inferno creates a distinctive, professional aesthetic
    that goes well beyond defaults
  - Comprehensive data design with four distinct distribution components creating
    realistic density variation across the full count range
  - Fully vectorized hex computation is efficient and well-commented despite the complexity
  - Perfect spec compliance — all required features present including perceptually
    uniform colormap
  weaknesses:
  - Minor cosmetic gaps between hexagons in sparse regions (tiling artifact from manual
    computation)
  - Manual hex binning dominates the codebase, limiting library mastery score (plotnine
    limitation, not implementation fault)

  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning density map titled "Seismic
    Event Density · hexbin-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" on a warm beige background
    (#f0edeb). Hexagons are filled using the inferno colormap, progressing from near-black
    (low counts ~1-5) through deep purple and magenta to orange and bright yellow
    (high counts ~50+). Two prominent density hotspots are visible: a large primary
    cluster centered around longitude ~35.5°E / latitude ~37°N with bright yellow/orange
    centers, and a secondary cluster near longitude ~37.5°E / latitude ~38.5°N also
    showing intense orange/yellow. A smaller medium-density cluster appears near longitude
    ~33.5°E / latitude ~36.5°N. Diffuse low-density hexagons in dark purple/black
    fill the surrounding area. The x-axis is labeled "Longitude (°E)" (range 32-40),
    y-axis "Latitude (°N)" (range ~35-40). A colorbar on the right shows "Event Count"
    with values from ~10 to ~50+. Grid lines are absent. Hex edges use the background
    color for subtle separation. Typography is bold, well-sized, and uses a custom
    color hierarchy.'
