review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution implementing violin plots in pygal which lacks native
    violin chart support
  - Clean manual KDE implementation with proper bandwidth calculation using Silvermans
    rule
  - 'Properly includes all spec requirements: mirrored density, quartile boxes, and
    median lines'
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette
  - Good separation and layout of four categories
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is redundant since x-axis already shows category labels
  - Quartile boxes inside violins are quite small and subtle, could be more prominent
  - Performance scores exceeding 100 seems unusual for a score context (typically
    0-100)
