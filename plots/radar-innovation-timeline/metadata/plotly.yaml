review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy through marker size, opacity, and bold text varying
    by ring — immediately communicates priority/timeline
  - 'Complete spec compliance: 270° layout, 4 rings, 4 sectors, 26 labeled items,
    distinct shapes/colors, subtle ring fills — all specification requirements met'
  - Realistic, current technology data with plausible ring placements (e.g., LLM Agents
    in Adopt, Quantum ML in Hold)
  - Strong Plotly usage with Scatterpolar, interactive hover templates, and HTML export
  - 'Thoughtful design details: subtle gradient ring fills, white marker edges, dotted
    sector dividers, colored sector headers matching marker colors'
  weaknesses:
  - Some label crowding around the Adopt ring where multiple sectors converge near
    the center
  - Left-edge Biotech labels (Longevity Engineering, Synthetic Biology) reach very
    close to the canvas boundary
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree (three-quarter circle) polar
    radar chart titled "radar-innovation-timeline · plotly · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle.
    Four concentric rings represent time horizons from center outward: Adopt (Now),
    Trial (0-1 yr), Assess (1-3 yr), and Hold (3+ yr), separated by subtle circular
    boundary lines with progressively fading blue background fills. The chart is divided
    into four angular sectors labeled in bold colored text along the outer edge: AI
    & ML (navy blue, top), Cloud & Infra (orange, right), Sustainability (teal, bottom),
    and Biotech (purple, left). Each sector uses distinct marker shapes — circles
    for AI & ML, diamonds for Cloud & Infra, squares for Sustainability, and triangles
    for Biotech. Marker sizes decrease from inner to outer rings, creating visual
    hierarchy emphasizing near-term items. Adopt-ring items are bold-labeled and fully
    opaque. 26 technology items are labeled and positioned across rings and sectors.
    A legend box on the right identifies the four sectors with their shapes and colors,
    and a "Time Horizons" annotation box below it explains the ring meanings. Ring
    labels are positioned just outside the 270° boundary on the left side. Dotted
    radial lines separate the sectors. The overall palette is colorblind-safe with
    navy, orange, teal, and purple on a white background.'
