review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution for polar coordinates in plotnine by manually converting
    to Cartesian space
  - Well-constructed circular gridlines and radial spokes using geom_path and geom_segment
  - Clean data flow with meaningful hourly activity pattern that demonstrates cyclical
    behavior
  - Proper use of coord_fixed(ratio=1) to ensure circular appearance
  - Good visual hierarchy with subtle grid and prominent data points
  - Title format follows pyplots.ai conventions correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Radius labels (25, 50, 75, 100) could include units or context (e.g., Activity
    Level)
  - The implementation relies heavily on manual Cartesian conversion rather than leveraging
    plotnine distinctive features
