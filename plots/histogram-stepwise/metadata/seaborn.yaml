review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot with element=step and fill=False to create clean
    step histograms
  - Two overlapping distributions clearly demonstrate the comparison use case mentioned
    in spec
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with strong contrast between blue and yellow
  - All text sizes follow guidelines (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Realistic service response time scenario with appropriate exponential distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Data scenario is functional but generic - could use more specific service names
    or context
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is acceptable but could be slightly more subtle at 0.2
