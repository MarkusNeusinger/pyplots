  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts wordcloud module with proper configuration (archimedean
    spiral, rotation options)
  - 'Colorblind-safe color palette with good variety (#306998, #FFD43B, #9467BD, #17BECF,
    #8C564B, #2CA02C, #E377C2)'
  - Realistic developer survey data with 35 technology terms and appropriate frequency
    weights
  - Title format correctly follows spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated, with HTML using responsive sizing (100% width)
  - Proper inline script embedding for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Good tooltip configuration showing word and mention count
  weaknesses:
  - Code has some redundancy with two separate HTML template generations (inline vs
    CDN versions)
  - Word cloud appears slightly top-heavy in the layout distribution
  - Could benefit from wider weight range for more dramatic size differences between
    common and rare terms
  image_description: 'The word cloud displays 35 technology-related terms from a developer
    survey on a white background. The largest word is "python" (in blue, #306998),
    followed by "javascript" (green), "data" (teal), "cloud" (orange), "api" (purple),
    and "machine learning" (yellow-gold). Words are arranged at various angles (0°
    to ~60°) in an archimedean spiral pattern, creating a visually appealing cluster.
    The color palette includes blue, yellow, purple, cyan, brown, green, and pink
    - all colorblind-safe choices. The title "Developer Survey · wordcloud-basic ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. Smaller terms
    like "documentation", "architecture", "refactoring", and "opensource" are visible
    but proportionally smaller. The word cloud fills the center of the canvas well
    with balanced whitespace.'
