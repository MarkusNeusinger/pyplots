review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with theoretical PDF overlay
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good color choices with blue histogram and contrasting yellow PDF line
  - Proper density normalization (area under histogram = 1)
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate sample size (500)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text is small (16pt) and difficult to read at full resolution; should be
    larger (e.g., 20pt)
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities like hover tooltips to show bin
    values
  - Minor empty space on the right side of the plot
