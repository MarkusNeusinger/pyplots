review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the horizon chart concept with proper band folding
    and color intensity encoding
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with distinct patterns for each server type
    (Database daily cycle, Cache spikes, Worker batch processing)
  - Clean use of Altair's faceting for multi-series comparison in compact vertical
    space
  - Proper use of declarative color scale mapping for positive/negative bands
  - Well-organized data transformation to create band data from raw time series
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels use technical codes (positive_0, positive_1, etc.) instead of human-readable
    descriptions like Low, Medium, High intensity
  - Could add interactivity (tooltips) to leverage Altair strengths for exploring
    specific time points
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizon chart showing server CPU metrics
    over a 24-hour period for 6 servers: API Gateway, Cache, Database, Web Server
    1, Web Server 2, and Worker. Each server is shown in a separate horizontal band/row
    using Altair''s faceting. The chart uses a blue color scheme (light to dark: #a6c8e0,
    #306998, #1a3d5c) for positive values and red (light to dark: #f5b7b1, #e74c3c,
    #922b21) for negative values, with 3 bands of intensity each. The x-axis shows
    time from 00:00 to 23:00 with labels every hour. Server names appear on the left
    side of each row. A legend labeled "Band Intensity" is positioned on the right
    showing the 6 color codes (positive_0, positive_1, positive_2, negative_0, negative_1,
    negative_2). The title "Server CPU Metrics (24h) · horizon-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left.'

        comment: Good use of Altair's declarative approach with faceting and color
          scales, but could leverage more Altair-specific features like interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
