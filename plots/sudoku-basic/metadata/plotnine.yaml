review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with thick/thin line differentiation for 3×3 boxes
    vs cells
  - Clean monochrome design perfect for printing as specified
  - Numbers are bold and well-centered within cells
  - Proper y-axis flipping to place row 0 at top (standard Sudoku orientation)
  - Square aspect ratio is ideal for Sudoku grid
  - Uses a valid, real Sudoku puzzle as sample data
  weaknesses:
  - Could use slightly lighter gray for thin lines to increase contrast with thick
    lines
  - The figure_size could be larger for even better resolution at 300 DPI
  image_description: The plot displays a 9×9 Sudoku grid on a clean white background.
    The title "sudoku-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black
    text. Thick black lines (approximately 2pt weight) clearly delineate the nine
    3×3 box regions at positions 0, 3, 6, and 9. Thinner gray lines separate individual
    cells within each box. Numbers (5, 3, 7, 6, 1, 9, 5, 9, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 4, 8, 3,
    1, 7, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 4, 1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 9) are displayed in bold black font, centered
    within their respective cells. Empty cells (zeros in the data) are rendered as
    blank spaces. The grid uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with good proportions.

  verdict: APPROVED
