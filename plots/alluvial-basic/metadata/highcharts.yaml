review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts sankey chart with column positioning to create proper
    alluvial structure
  - Colorblind-safe palette with consistent colors for each party across all time
    points
  - Clear visual hierarchy with good title/subtitle formatting
  - Proper use of link opacity (0.4) for overlapping flows to improve readability
  - Realistic voter migration data that demonstrates the alluvial concept well
  - Clean annotations for time point labels at the bottom
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled; while nodes are labeled, adding a small legend could help
    viewers quickly understand the color mapping
  - Node labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
