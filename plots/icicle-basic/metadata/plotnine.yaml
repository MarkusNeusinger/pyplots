review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships visible
    through spatial adjacency
  - 'Smart label handling: shows name+value for wide rectangles, name-only for medium,
    hidden for narrow'
  - Good color contrast between hierarchy levels with appropriate text colors (white
    on dark, black on light)
  - Proper bottom-up value aggregation for non-leaf nodes
  - Clean theme_void usage appropriate for this chart type
  - Well-implemented BFS algorithm for layout calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows Hierarchy Level with just numbers 0-3 instead of the more descriptive
    labels defined in the code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal icicle chart visualizing a file
    system hierarchy. The root node (dark blue, 4590 MB) spans the full width at the
    top. Below it, three level-1 children (lighter blue) show Projects (2140 MB),
    Photos (1540 MB), and Documents (910 MB) proportionally sized. Level 2 (yellow)
    contains items like WebApp, DataSci, Mobile, Vacation, Family, Events, Reports,
    Invoices, and Notes. Level 3 (brown) shows leaf nodes: Backend, Frontend, Config,
    Models, and Scripts under the Projects branch. White borders separate rectangles.
    A legend on the right shows "Hierarchy Level" with levels 0-3. The title "icicle-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in bold.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_rect, geom_text, scale_fill_manual,
          theme_void; good use of plotnine but icicle charts are not a native strength
          of plotnine
  verdict: APPROVED
