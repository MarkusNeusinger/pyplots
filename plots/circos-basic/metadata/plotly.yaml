review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Circos visualization using Plotly Scatter with fill=toself
    for complex shapes
  - Ribbon colors now properly blend source and target segment colors (addressed previous
    feedback)
  - Includes inner track for additional data layer (GDP index) as specified
  - Good interactive HTML output alongside PNG export
  - Well-chosen color palette with 8 distinct, accessible colors
  - Proper proportional sizing of segments based on economic importance
  - Adaptive label positioning based on angle to minimize overlap
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format still includes extra descriptor: should be circos-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai not Regional Trade Flows · circos-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai'
  - Helper function blend_colors() violates strict KISS principle (imports → data
    → plot → save)
