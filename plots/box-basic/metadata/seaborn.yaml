review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with salary distributions across departments
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: median, quartiles, whiskers, outliers all present'
  - Good handling of seaborn 0.14+ API compatibility with hue parameter
  - Clean currency formatting on y-axis improves readability
  - Each department has visually distinct characteristics (different medians, spreads,
    outlier counts)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive features like stripplot overlay, violin
    plots, or statistical annotations
  - Yellow color for Marketing category could have slightly better contrast
