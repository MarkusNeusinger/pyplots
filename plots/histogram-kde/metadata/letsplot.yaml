review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color contrast between histogram (blue) and KDE (yellow) ensures clear
    visual distinction
  - Proper use of density scale (y="..density..") so histogram and KDE are on comparable
    scales
  - Realistic financial data scenario with leptokurtic distribution showing heavier
    tails
  - Semi-transparent histogram bars (alpha=0.5) allow KDE curve to remain visible
    as specified
  - Clean ggplot2-style code following lets-plot conventions
  - Appropriate bin count (35) balances detail and smoothness
  weaknesses:
  - Output path uses Path(__file__).parent which saves to implementations directory;
    should save to working directory as plot.png
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram with KDE overlay showing simulated
    daily stock returns. The histogram bars are semi-transparent blue (#306998) with
    darker blue borders, ranging from approximately -9% to +10% on the x-axis. The
    y-axis displays "Density" from 0 to 0.26. A bright yellow/gold KDE curve (#FFD43B)
    smoothly overlays the histogram, revealing the underlying probability density.
    The distribution is roughly bell-shaped but shows heavier tails and slight asymmetry,
    consistent with leptokurtic financial returns. The title "histogram-kde · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The minimal grid with subtle gray lines provides
    good readability without distraction.

          having one labeling "Histogram" and "KDE" would improve clarity)

          features or advanced theming
  verdict: APPROVED
