review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing positive changes, negative changes (Finance -6),
    and no change (Customer Support) to demonstrate all dumbbell scenarios
  - Proper horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended in spec
  - Data sorted by difference magnitude to reveal patterns
  - Good color choices (Python Blue/Yellow) that are colorblind-accessible
  - Descriptive legend labels and clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Connecting lines between dots are not rendering/visible - this is the defining
    feature of a dumbbell chart
  - Grid lines are barely visible despite configuration
  - Missing y-axis title to describe what the categories represent
