review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - R² value prominently displayed in the legend (0.791)
  - Good use of pygal custom styling for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic educational scenario with sensible data ranges
  - Proper calculation of confidence intervals using scipy stats
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval shown as separate dashed lines instead of filled semi-transparent
    band (spec requirement)
  - No regression equation annotation (y = mx + b) as suggested in spec
  - Legend entries for CI upper/lower as separate series is misleading - should represent
    a single confidence band
  - Scatter point dots could be slightly larger for better visibility at this data
    density
