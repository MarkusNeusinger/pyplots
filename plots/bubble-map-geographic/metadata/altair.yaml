review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar for geographic visualization
  - Proper layering of basemap and bubble overlay with matching projections
  - Good use of tooltips showing city, population, region, and coordinates
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data definition
  - Appropriate bubble sizing with scale domain matching data range
  - White stroke outlines improve bubble distinction
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Size legend uses single color rather than showing how colors vary by region in
    the actual bubbles
  - Code lacks a reproducibility comment about data source
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map with an equirectangular projection
    showing major city populations as sized circular markers. The base map shows country
    boundaries in light gray (#E8E8E0) with subtle borders. Bubbles are positioned
    at city locations with size proportional to population (5-40 million range). Colors
    encode regions: blue for Asia, yellow for Europe, green for North America, red/coral
    for South America, purple for Africa, and cyan for Oceania. Tokyo appears as the
    largest bubble in Asia. A size legend on the bottom-left shows the population
    scale (5-40 million), and a color legend on the bottom-right identifies regions.
    The title "World City Populations · bubble-map-geographic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top center. White stroke outlines on bubbles (1.5px) provide
    separation, and 70% opacity enables viewing of overlapping markers in dense areas
    like East Asia.'
