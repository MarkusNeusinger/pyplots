review:
  strengths:
  - Effective visual hierarchy through marker size, opacity, and graduated ring fills
    that naturally draw the eye from center outward
  - Excellent data quality with 26 real, recognizable technologies and plausible ring
    assignments
  - Strong use of Plotly Scatterpolar API with interactive hover tooltips and HTML
    export
  - Well-refined visual design with hidden axes, subtle boundaries, and styled legend/annotation
    boxes
  - Per-item textposition assignments show care in label placement
  weaknesses:
  - Some text labels overlap or crowd in dense areas, particularly around the Adopt
    ring and lower sectors (Digital Twins Health / Product Passports, Carbon Tracking
    APIs / mRNA Therapeutics)
  - Missing distinct marker shapes per sector as the spec suggests (distinct marker
    shapes or colors)
  - The Time Horizons annotation box uses 13pt font which is small relative to other
    text
  - Lower-right area of the canvas has notable empty space that could be better utilized
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree polar/radar chart on a white
    background at 3600x3600 px (square format). Four concentric rings represent time
    horizons: Adopt (innermost), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost), separated by
    subtle gray boundary lines with graduated blue-tinted background fills that are
    stronger toward the center. Four angular sectors divide the chart: AI & ML (top,
    steel blue), Cloud & Infra (right, orange), Sustainability (bottom, teal), and
    Biotech (left, purple). Each sector is separated by dotted gray divider lines.
    Twenty-six innovation items are plotted as colored circular markers with white
    borders, sized by ring (largest for Adopt, smallest for Hold). Adopt-ring items
    use bold text labels. Item labels are positioned using per-item text positioning
    to reduce overlap. Sector header labels appear along the outer edge in their sector''s
    color at 22pt. Ring labels (Adopt Now, Trial 0-1 yr, Assess 1-3 yr, Hold 3+ yr)
    are staggered along the right side past the 270-degree boundary. A Sectors legend
    with colored markers sits in the upper right, and a Time Horizons annotation box
    with descriptions sits in the lower right. The title reads radar-innovation-timeline
    plotly pyplots.ai with a gray subtitle.'

        comment: All font sizes explicitly set (title 30pt, headers 22pt, items 16pt,

        comment: 'Some crowding in dense areas: Digital Twins/Product Passports and

        comment: Marker size hierarchy by ring (22-17-13-10) creates effective visual
          depth. White borders help. Hold markers slightly small.
