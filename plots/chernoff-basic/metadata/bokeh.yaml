review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual differentiation between sectors through color and facial expression
    patterns
  - Excellent business context with realistic company performance metrics
  - Proper normalization of data as spec requires
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool for interactivity'
  - Feature mapping subtitle explains what each facial feature represents
  - Well-organized 4x3 grid layout makes comparison easy
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned too far from the faces (at very top of plot)
  - Faces could be slightly larger to better utilize the canvas space
  image_description: 'The plot displays 12 Chernoff faces arranged in a 4x3 grid on
    a light gray background. The title "chernoff-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in black text. A legend at the top shows three colored circles representing
    sectors: Tech (blue), Retail (yellow), and Energy (brown/tan). The top row contains
    4 Tech company faces (blue, wider faces with smiling expressions indicating higher
    metrics). The middle row shows 4 Retail company faces (yellow, more circular with
    neutral expressions). The bottom row displays 4 Energy company faces (brown/tan,
    narrower with frowning expressions indicating lower metrics). Each face is labeled
    below (e.g., "Tech #1", "Retail #1"). A subtitle at the bottom explains the feature
    mapping. The faces have clearly visible features: eyebrows, eyes with white sclera
    and dark pupils, a simple nose line, and curved mouths.'

        comment: Title at 32pt is excellent, labels at 20pt are readable, subtitle
          at 22pt is clear. Minor deduction for slightly small subtitle relative to
          canvas size.

        comment: Good use of ColumnDataSource for hover tooltips, HoverTool for interactivity
          (though not visible in PNG), Label objects for text positioning. Uses patch()
          for drawing ellipses which is idiomatic Bokeh.
  verdict: APPROVED
