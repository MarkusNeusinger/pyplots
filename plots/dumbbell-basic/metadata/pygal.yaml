review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal dumbbell chart implementation using pygal XY chart creatively
  - Data sorted by improvement magnitude reveals clear patterns
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate dot sizes
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario that matches spec example
  - Proper use of separate series for before/after with legend entries
  weaknesses:
  - Connecting lines are yellow instead of gray/neutral as specified (spec says thin
    and subtle)
  - Title format adds descriptive prefix instead of strictly following {spec-id} ·
    {library} · pyplots.ai
  - Grid lines use the same yellow color as the After data points, reducing visual
    distinction
  - All data shows only positive changes; including one or two categories with no
    change or slight decrease would better demonstrate the chart full capability
