  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot-specific geom_pie with layer_labels chaining, spacer_width/spacer_color,
    and stroke_side — features unique to this library
  - Narrative subtitle adds data storytelling beyond the default, guiding the viewer
    to key insights
  - Custom Python Blue-first color palette with good colorblind consideration
  - Clean theme_void with white spacers creates a polished, publication-oriented look
  - Realistic market share data with recognizable brands and plausible proportions
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance is poor: the pie sits center-left with the legend far right, leaving
    large empty areas above/below the chart — canvas utilization could be improved'
  - The OPPO explode offset (0.07) is too subtle to serve as meaningful visual emphasis
    — a larger offset (0.10-0.15) would make the emphasis clearer
  - Orange (#FF7043) and yellow (#FFD43B) slices are adjacent, which may cause issues
    for some colorblind viewers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "Global Smartphone Market
    Share · pie-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "OPPO''s 8.8% slice
    is the smallest — ''Others'' dominate at 35%". Five slices represent: Apple (23.1%,
    dark blue #306998), Samsung (19.4%, yellow #FFD43B), Xiaomi (13.7%, green #4CAF50),
    OPPO (8.8%, orange-coral #FF7043, slightly exploded outward), and Others (35.0%,
    grey #90A4AE). Each slice has a percentage label displayed in its interior. White
    spacers separate the slices for visual clarity. A legend titled "Brand" is positioned
    to the right of the pie listing all five categories. The background is clean white
    with no axes or grid (theme_void). The pie is centered slightly left of the canvas
    with whitespace to the right near the legend.'

        comment: theme_void removes all chrome. White spacers and stroke create polished
          separation. Just short of perfect due to layout.
