review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation for category label readability as recommended
    in spec
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-sized points and error bars with caps
  - Helpful reference line showing overall mean with legend explanation
  - Good use of varying confidence interval widths to demonstrate uncertainty differences
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars drawn manually with matplotlib errorbar instead of using seaborn native
    confidence interval features
  - All confidence intervals are symmetric around estimates; real-world CIs are often
    asymmetric
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate chart showing satisfaction
    scores (scale 1-10) for six products (A through F). Each product is represented
    by a blue circular marker (#306998) with horizontal error bars extending to show
    confidence intervals. The error bars have clear caps at endpoints. A vertical
    dashed yellow/gold line indicates the overall mean (6.9). The title follows the
    correct format "point-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". X-axis is labeled "Satisfaction
    Score (1-10)" and Y-axis is labeled "Product". A legend in the lower right explains
    the overall mean reference line. The plot has a clean white background with subtle
    vertical grid lines (alpha ~0.3). The layout is well-balanced with the chart filling
    the canvas appropriately.
