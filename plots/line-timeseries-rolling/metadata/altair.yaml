review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with conditional encoding for strokeWidth
    and opacity
  - Clean data transformation using pd.melt for tidy/long format suitable for Altair
  - 'Well-chosen color scheme (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that is colorblind-safe'
  - Realistic temperature data scenario with clear seasonal trend
  - Proper use of centered rolling window (center=True) for accurate moving average
    alignment
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement overlaps slightly with data points in the upper-right corner;
    could use orient=bottom or place outside the plot area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series of daily temperature data over
    approximately 6 months (January to late June 2024). It features two overlaid lines:
    a thin, semi-transparent blue line representing "Raw Data" showing daily fluctuations
    with considerable noise, and a prominent thicker yellow/gold line representing
    the "7-Day Rolling Average" that smoothly reveals the underlying seasonal warming
    trend. The temperature rises from around -2°C in winter to approximately 22°C
    in early summer. The chart has a white background with subtle dashed grid lines,
    clear axis labels with units ("Date" and "Temperature (°C)"), and a well-positioned
    legend in the top-right corner. The title follows the required format.'
