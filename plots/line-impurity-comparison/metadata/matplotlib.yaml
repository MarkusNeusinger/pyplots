review:
  strengths:
  - Mathematically correct implementation with proper edge case handling (entropy
    at p=0 and p=1)
  - Clean, professional design with explicit font sizing, spine removal, and subtle
    grid
  - LaTeX formulas in the legend add educational value and polish
  - Solid/dashed line differentiation aids accessibility beyond just color
  - KISS code structure with only necessary imports
  weaknesses:
  - 'Data storytelling is weak: the key insight (both measures peak at same point,
    Gini is a scaled version of entropy) is not visually emphasized — consider adding
    a shaded region between curves, secondary annotation, or visual emphasis on the
    similarity'
  - Annotation only explicitly calls out the entropy maximum; the Gini maximum at
    0.5 has a marker but no text — both maxima should be annotated per the spec
  - Impurity Measure y-axis label is generic — could be more descriptive (e.g., Impurity
    / Information Loss (normalized))
  - Library mastery is average — could leverage matplotlib-specific features like
    fill_between for the area between curves, custom spine styling, or secondary annotations
  image_description: The plot displays two smooth curves on the same axes comparing
    Gini Impurity and Entropy as decision tree splitting criteria. The Gini Impurity
    curve is rendered as a solid blue line (#306998) peaking at 0.5 when p=0.5, while
    the Entropy (normalized) curve is a dashed terracotta/brownish-red line (#C1694F)
    peaking at 1.0 when p=0.5. Both curves start at 0 when p=0, reach their maximum
    at p=0.5, and return to 0 when p=1. Dot markers highlight both maxima at p=0.5.
    An annotation "Maximum impurity p = 0.5" with an arrow points to the entropy maximum.
    The legend in the upper left includes LaTeX-rendered formulas for both metrics.
    Title reads "line-impurity-comparison · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". X-axis labeled
    "Probability p" (range 0–1), Y-axis labeled "Impurity Measure" (range 0–~1.08).
    Top and right spines removed, subtle y-axis grid present. Overall clean, professional
    appearance with 16:9 landscape layout.
