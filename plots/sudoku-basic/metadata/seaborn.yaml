review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear distinction between 3×3 box boundaries and
    individual cell lines
  - Clean, print-ready monochrome design exactly as specified
  - Numbers are perfectly centered and highly readable with appropriate font size
    and weight
  - Proper orientation with row 0 at top (correct y-axis inversion)
  - Uses a well-known, valid Sudoku puzzle as example data
  weaknesses: []
  improvements:
  - Consider using seaborn heatmap functionality with custom annotations as an alternative
    approach to leverage more seaborn features
  - The 16:9 aspect ratio creates horizontal whitespace around the square grid; could
    consider adjusting figure size to be closer to square
