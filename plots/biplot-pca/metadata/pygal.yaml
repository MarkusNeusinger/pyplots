review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Iris dataset which is a canonical example for PCA biplots
  - Proper variance explained percentages displayed in axis labels
  - Unit circle reference for loading magnitude interpretation
  - Colorblind-friendly color scheme with distinct colors for species vs. loading
    vectors
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Good overall layout with data well-distributed across the canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Loading arrows rendered as filled polygon shapes rather than traditional line
    arrows with arrowheads
  - Legend entries truncated making feature names harder to read at a glance
  - Some visual overlap of loading arrows near the origin obscures their exact starting
    point
  - Multiple legend entries (8 total) create visual clutter in the legend area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot of the Iris dataset at 4800x2700
    resolution. Three species are shown as scatter points: Setosa (blue, clustered
    on the left), Versicolor (yellow, in the middle), and Virginica (green, on the
    right). Four loading vectors are displayed as filled arrow shapes originating
    from near the origin: Sepal Width (purple, pointing upward), Sepal Length (red/brown,
    pointing right-upward), Petal Width (teal/cyan, pointing right), and Petal Length
    (orange, pointing right). A dashed red unit circle provides reference for loading
    magnitudes. The title reads "biplot-pca · pygal · pyplots.ai" and axes are labeled
    "PC1 (73.0%)" and "PC2 (22.9%)" showing variance explained. The legend at top-left
    shows all 8 series: three species, the unit circle reference, and four loading
    vector names.'
