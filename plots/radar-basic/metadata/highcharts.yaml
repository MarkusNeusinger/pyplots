review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent radar chart with proper polar/spider chart implementation using Highcharts
    AreaSeries
  - Perfect colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with 25% fill opacity for overlap
    visibility
  - Comprehensive employee performance comparison showing contrasting profiles (technical
    vs soft skills)
  - Well-implemented hexagonal polygon gridlines at 20-point intervals as specified
  - Professional layout with good canvas utilization and well-placed legend
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis labels could include a unit context like Performance Score (0-100)
    though current implementation is acceptable
