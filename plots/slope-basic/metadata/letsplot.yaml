review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent slope chart implementation with clear visual representation of change
    direction
  - Well-designed data that minimizes label overlap while showing variety in changes
  - Proper use of ggplot2 grammar with geom_segment for connecting lines
  - Good color coding with blue for increases and red for decreases
  - Labels on both endpoints as required by specification
  - Appropriate sizing for high-resolution output (1600x900 base with 3x scale)
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette (blue/red) is not fully colorblind-safe; consider using a more accessible
    combination
  - Horizontal grid lines could be more subtle with lower alpha
