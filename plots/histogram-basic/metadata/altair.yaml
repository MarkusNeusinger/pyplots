  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic human height data provides an intuitive example
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Tooltips added for interactivity in HTML output

  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to aid in reading frequency values
  - Could add bar edge/stroke color for better visual definition between bins
