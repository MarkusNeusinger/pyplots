review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional layout with proper faceting using plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Appropriate use of Iris dataset as a classic multivariate example
  - Honest subtitle acknowledging plotnine limitations for interactive features
  - Good color scheme with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color
  - Proper categorical handling for facet ordering
  weaknesses:
  - Missing diagonal univariate distributions (histograms or KDE) - this is a key
    spec requirement
  - No axis labels with units (e.g., Length (cm))
  - Marker size (3) is too small for 150 data points - should be larger for better
    visibility
  - Yellow/red color combination could be improved for colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) showing
    pairwise relationships between four Iris dataset variables: Sepal Length, Sepal
    Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. The diagonal cells are empty (no univariate
    distributions shown). Each off-diagonal cell contains a scatter plot with points
    colored by species: blue (#306998) for setosa, yellow (#FFD43B) for versicolor,
    and red/coral (#E74C3C) for virginica. The title reads "scatter-matrix-interactive
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining it''s static and interactive
    brushing requires Plotly/Bokeh/Altair. Variable names appear as facet strip labels
    on top (x-axis variables) and right side (y-axis variables). Points use alpha=0.7
    for transparency. Legend is positioned at the bottom with species labels. Background
    panels are light gray (#f8f8f8) with no grid lines.'
