review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of horizontal orientation (coord_flip) for better label readability
    with many categories
  - Smart categorical ordering technique to ensure largest values appear at top after
    flip
  - Clean currency formatting on axis with scale_y_continuous(format="${}K")
  - Well-tuned text sizes for high-resolution output (26pt title, 22pt axis titles,
    18pt tick labels)
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with ggsize and scale parameter for
    PNG export
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and appropriate color
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label says "Monthly Revenue" but could specify units more explicitly (e.g.,
    "Monthly Revenue (USD thousands)")
  - Could leverage more lets-plot specific features like tooltips configuration for
    HTML export
  - 'Grid styling: minor grid is blanked but could keep subtle major grid for value
    reference'
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal sorted bar chart showing monthly
    revenue by product category. The bars are arranged in descending order from top
    (Electronics at ~$425K) to bottom (Health at ~$62K). All bars use a consistent
    blue color (#306998). The title "bar-sorted · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold. The y-axis is labeled "Product Category" with 10 categories
    listed, and the x-axis shows "Monthly Revenue" with currency formatting ($0.0K
    to $400.0K+). The chart uses a minimal theme with subtle dashed horizontal grid
    lines and clean white background. The layout is well-balanced with the plot utilizing
    most of the canvas area.

        comment: Y-axis label "Product Category" and X-axis "Monthly Revenue" are
