review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh RangeTool for navigator functionality - idiomatic Bokeh
    solution
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper data generation and fixed seed
  - Good visual consistency between main chart and navigator (same line color, shared
    y_range)
  - Appropriate sizing - navigator is ~18% of main chart height as per spec
  - Yellow selection box provides clear visual feedback of selected range
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size (32pt) could be increased to 36-40pt for better visibility on
    4800px canvas
  - Grid styling with dashed lines works but solid subtle lines might be cleaner
  - Bokeh toolbar icons on the right side slightly affect visual balance
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with mini navigator featuring
    sensor reading data over 3 years (Jan 2022 - Jan 2025). The main chart (top) shows
    a zoomed-in view of approximately 6 months of data (Jan 2024 - Jun 2024) with
    a blue line (#306998 Python Blue) showing sensor readings ranging from ~40 to
    ~100 units. The Y-axis is labeled "Sensor Reading (units)" and X-axis shows "Date"
    with monthly tick marks. Below the main chart is a mini navigator pane showing
    the complete 3-year dataset at reduced scale. A yellow/gold (#FFD43B Python Yellow)
    semi-transparent selection box in the navigator highlights the currently visible
    range in the main chart. The title "line-navigator · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    in the top-left. The data shows an upward trend with seasonal oscillation and
    noise, demonstrating the navigator's ability to explore different time periods.
    Grid lines are subtle with dashed styling. Bokeh toolbar icons appear on the right
    side of the main chart.
