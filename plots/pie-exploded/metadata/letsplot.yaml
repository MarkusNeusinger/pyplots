review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional color palette starting with Python Blue
  - Excellent use of lets-plot layer_labels() for percentage formatting
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with appropriate department breakdown
  - Good legend positioning and title formatting
  weaknesses:
  - The explosion effect is NOT visible in the rendered output - the key feature of
    this plot type is missing visually despite the code using the explode aesthetic
  - The pie chart appears as a standard pie without any slices visually separated
    from the center
  - The spec requires one or more slices visually separated (exploded) from the center
    but this is not achieved in the visual output
