review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent financial dashboard theme demonstrating diverse plot types in a cohesive
    2x2 grid
  - 'Consistent color scheme (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B) across all subplots creates
    visual unity'
  - Clean code following KISS principles with good data generation logic
  - All axis labels include units making the plots self-explanatory
  - Rolling average overlay on price chart adds analytical value
  - Scatter plot includes linear regression with confidence band
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend in price chart to distinguish actual price from moving average
    (relies on title description only)
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive interactive features (tooltips, coordinated
    brushing) even in static output
  - Scatter points in bottom-right plot could be slightly larger for better visibility
