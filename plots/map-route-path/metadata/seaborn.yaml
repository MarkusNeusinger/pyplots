review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme using viridis for time progression
  - Clear distinction between start (green circle) and end (red square) markers
  - Direction arrows at regular intervals effectively show travel direction
  - Realistic hiking trail data generation with believable path winding
  - Proper use of equal aspect ratio for geographic accuracy
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive plotting features; uses matplotlib ax.scatter/ax.plot
    directly instead of sns.scatterplot or sns.lineplot
  - Missing geographic basemap as suggested in specification
  - Axis labels lack degree symbols for geographic coordinates
  image_description: The plot displays a hiking route path visualization with 200
    waypoints in the NYC area (Central Park vicinity). The path progresses from bottom-left
    (start, marked with a large green circle) to top-right (end, marked with a large
    red square). Individual waypoints are rendered as scatter points colored using
    the viridis colormap, transitioning from purple (0 minutes) through teal/cyan
    to yellow (approximately 80+ minutes), representing elapsed time. A subtle blue
    connecting line traces the route path beneath the scatter points. Direction arrows
    appear at regular intervals along the path, pointing in the direction of travel.
    The colorbar on the right shows "Elapsed Time (minutes)" with values 0-80+. The
    title reads "map-route-path · seaborn · pyplots.ai" and axes are labeled "Longitude"
    and "Latitude" with appropriate geographic coordinates. A legend in the upper
    left identifies Start and End markers. Grid lines are visible with subtle alpha.

        comment: Uses sns.set_context() for styling, but scatter/plot use matplotlib
          directly. Does not leverage seaborn's distinctive features like lineplot
          with hue or scatterplot.
