review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear thick/thin line distinction for 3×3 boxes
    vs cells
  - Perfect use of Altair layering system to combine thin lines, thick lines, and
    text marks
  - Clean, printable monochrome design exactly as specified
  - Numbers are large, bold, and well-centered within cells
  - Code follows KISS principles with clear data preparation and chart composition
  - Properly saves both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - The axis labels criterion (VQ-06) doesn't apply to this spec type, but this is
    handled appropriately
  image_description: The plot displays a 9×9 Sudoku grid with the title "sudoku-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top. The grid has a clean black-and-white design
    with thick black lines (approximately 4px) separating the nine 3×3 boxes and thinner
    lines (1px) dividing individual cells. Numbers are displayed in bold black text,
    centered within their respective cells. The puzzle shows a partially filled Sudoku
    with 30 given numbers distributed across the grid. Empty cells are displayed as
    blank spaces. The layout is square with excellent canvas utilization - the grid
    fills most of the available space.
