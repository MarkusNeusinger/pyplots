review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-accessible blue/orange palette instead of traditional red/green
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed
  - Informative brick size annotation
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid, talk context)
  - Proper legend placement and grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Bricks are NOT connected in proper stair-step pattern - each brick
    should start where the previous brick ended, creating a connected diagonal pattern.
    Current implementation shows disconnected floating bricks'
  - Spec requests green/up color for bullish and red/down for bearish but implementation
    uses blue/orange
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., Stock Price USD instead of Price
    $)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko-style chart with approximately 40
    bricks showing price movements. Blue bricks represent bullish (up) movements and
    orange bricks represent bearish (down) movements. The x-axis shows "Brick Index"
    (0-36), the y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from ~85 to ~110. The title "renko-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold. A legend in the upper
    left identifies "Bullish (Up)" and "Bearish (Down)" categories. An annotation
    box in the lower right shows "Brick Size: $2". The chart uses a white background
    with subtle horizontal grid lines. However, the bricks are NOT properly connected
    in the characteristic diagonal stair-step pattern - they appear to float at disconnected
    positions.'
