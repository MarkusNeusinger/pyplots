review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (HoverTool, TapTool, CustomJS callbacks)
  - Comprehensive tooltip showing category, revenue, percentage share, and units sold
  - Visual hover feedback with color change (blue to yellow)
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  - Clean, professional styling with subtle grid and good color choices
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle - alpha 0.3 with dashed style is acceptable but
    slightly prominent
  - X-axis category labels are slightly small relative to the large canvas dimensions
  image_description: 'The plot displays an interactive bar chart showing product category
    revenue data. Seven vertical bars represent categories: Electronics (highest,
    ~156,000), Clothing (~98,000), Home & Garden (~87,000), Sports (~72,000), Books
    (lowest, ~45,000), Toys (~63,000), and Food & Beverages (~112,000). All bars use
    a consistent steel blue color (#306998) with slight transparency. The title "bar-interactive
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left. The y-axis shows "Revenue (USD)"
    with values from 0 to 150,000+, and the x-axis shows "Product Category" with category
    labels slightly angled. The plot has a light gray background (#fafafa) with subtle
    dashed horizontal grid lines. A Bokeh toolbar with pan, zoom, and save tools is
    visible in the top-right corner.'
