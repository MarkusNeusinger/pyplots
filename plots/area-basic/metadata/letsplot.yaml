review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with subtitle narrative, peak/dip annotations, and
    loess trend line providing analytical context
  - Smart gradient simulation using dual geom_area layers with different alpha values
  - Strong library mastery with lets_plot-specific features like layer_tooltips()
    and label_format
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with appropriate complexity
  - Good visual design with intentional typographic hierarchy and minimal chrome
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis has slightly excessive headroom above the data (y_max set to peak_val *
    1.12 pushes empty space above the filled area)
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g. Daily Visitors count)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024. The filled area uses a blue color (#306998) with layered semi-transparency
    (alpha 0.15 and 0.35) to simulate a gradient effect. A solid blue line (width
    2.2) traces the data on top of the area fill. A dashed dark blue loess trend line
    shows the overall upward trajectory. Two annotated data points are highlighted:
    a red-outlined circle at the dip (~Jan 6, 4,299 visitors) with a red "▼ 4,299
    dip" label, and a blue-outlined circle at the peak (~Jan 29, 7,694 visitors) with
    a dark blue "▲ 7,694 peak" label. The title reads "area-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    with a subtitle "+15% average growth over January — weekly cycles with steady
    upward trend". The x-axis shows dates from Jan 01 to Jan 31, the y-axis shows
    "Daily Visitors" ranging from ~3,500 to ~8,500. Subtle horizontal gridlines are
    present; vertical gridlines are removed. The overall layout is clean with a minimal
    theme and balanced margins.'
