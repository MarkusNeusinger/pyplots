review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts organization chart module creating a clean hierarchical
    visualization
  - Proper color-coded level differentiation with consistent blue gradient leading
    to yellow species nodes
  - All 9 species now correctly positioned in the bottom row (fixed from previous
    attempt)
  - Informative subtitle and footer explaining the data source and scale concept
  - Clean curved connectors between hierarchical levels
  - Tooltips provide additional taxonomic rank information on hover
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Missing visual representation of branch lengths proportional to evolutionary distance
    (specification requirement)
  - No scale bar indicating evolutionary distance units (e.g., substitutions per site
    or MYA)
  - Species node labels are slightly small relative to the overall plot size
  - Footer text about branch lengths is misleading since branch lengths are not actually
    proportional in this organization chart layout
