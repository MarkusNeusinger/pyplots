review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color differentiation between main categories with colorblind-safe palette
  - Clear hierarchical structure with white borders showing nesting relationships
  - Good use of Plotly treemap features including hover templates and branchvalues
  - Text is legible at all levels with appropriate font sizing
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with sensible values
  weaknesses:
  - Root node Budget label appears small and could be more prominent
  - No units shown in the values (should indicate thousands)
