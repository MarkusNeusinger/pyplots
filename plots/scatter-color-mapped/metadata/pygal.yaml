review:
  strengths:
  - Effective workaround for pygal lack of continuous colormap by using discrete temperature
    bins
  - Viridis-inspired colorblind-safe palette with smooth gradient progression
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments explaining the approach
  - Realistic temperature sensor grid scenario with plausible radial temperature pattern
  - Good use of custom Style for appropriate font sizes at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend first bin label includes Temperature: prefix while others do not, creating
    inconsistency'
  - Layout could utilize more canvas space; legend at bottom takes significant real
    estate
