review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional ECDF visualization using seaborn native ecdfplot function
  - Perfect text sizing following library guidelines (title 24pt, labels 20pt, ticks
    16pt)
  - Appropriate line width (3) for high-resolution output
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha=0.3, dashed) aids percentile reading without visual
    distraction
  - Correct y-axis range enforcement (0 to 1) per specification requirements
  - Good data size (200 observations) within recommended 50-500 range
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack context/units - Value could be more descriptive for a real-world
    scenario
  - Could leverage more seaborn ECDF features like stat=count or complementary=True
    to showcase library capabilities
  - Data context is generic (random normal samples) rather than a compelling real-world
    scenario
  image_description: The plot displays a clear ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) step function with a steel blue line (#306998) against a white background.
    The x-axis is labeled "Value" and ranges from approximately 10 to 90, while the
    y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" and correctly spans from 0 to 1.0. The
    title "ecdf-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top.
    The step function exhibits the characteristic S-curve shape expected from normally
    distributed data (mean=50, std=15), with the steepest increase around the center
    (values 40-60) and flattening tails at both ends. Subtle dashed grid lines (alpha=0.3)
    aid in reading percentile values. The line width is appropriately thick (linewidth=3)
    for visibility at high resolution.
