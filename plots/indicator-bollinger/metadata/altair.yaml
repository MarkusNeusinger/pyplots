review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent layer composition with clear visual hierarchy: price line (yellow)
    stands out prominently against the band area and SMA'
  - Proper use of Altair declarative grammar with multiple marks layered correctly
  - Good use of dashed line for SMA distinguishes it from the band boundaries
  - Semi-transparent band area (25% opacity) allows price movements to be visible
    within the volatility envelope
  - Data generation shows realistic price behavior with trending periods and varying
    volatility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - The upper and lower band lines could use the same color as the SMA line but with
    solid styling to differentiate from the dashed SMA - currently all three use the
    same blue color which could cause confusion
  - No legend is present to identify what each line represents (price, SMA, upper/lower
    bands)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Bollinger Bands technical indicator chart with a landscape orientation. The title "indicator-bollinger · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in a clear, readable font.

    The chart shows price data over approximately 120 trading days (from late January to mid-June 2024). The key visual elements are:

    1. **Price Line (Yellow/Gold)**: A bright yellow line showing the closing price, which starts around $99-100, trends downward with volatility through February-March, reaching lows around $84-85 in late March, then consolidates and shows recovery toward the end around $88-91.

    2. **Bollinger Band Area (Light Blue with 25% opacity)**: A semi-transparent blue shaded region representing the volatility envelope between the upper and lower bands. The band width varies - narrower during consolidation periods and wider during volatile movements.

    3. **SMA Line (Blue Dashed)**: A dashed blue line running through the middle of the band area representing the 20-period Simple Moving Average, clearly distinguishable from the band boundaries.

    4. **Upper and Lower Band Lines**: Solid blue lines at 70% opacity defining the band boundaries, matching the band area color.

    The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately $82 to $112. The X-axis shows "Date" with tick marks at roughly weekly intervals, labels angled at -45 degrees for readability.

    The chart demonstrates classic Bollinger Band behavior: the price touching or breaking outside the bands at various points, band squeeze patterns, and price mean reversion toward the SMA.

          composition, proper encoding types (:T, :Q), mark_area with y/y2 encoding,
          configure_axis, and HTML export for interactivity
