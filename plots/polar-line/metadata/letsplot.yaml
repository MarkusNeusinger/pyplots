review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate implementation using manual Cartesian transformation
    when native coord_polar is unavailable
  - Clean visual design with appropriate colors, grid lines, and month labels
  - Good use of multiple series to demonstrate comparison capability
  - Realistic temperature data with clear seasonal patterns
  - Proper closed-loop polar lines connecting first and last points
  - Well-balanced layout with legend positioned cleanly
  weaknesses:
  - Missing temperature scale labels (no indication of what the concentric circles
    represent in °C)
  - 'Minor: LetsPlot.setup_html() call is unnecessary for PNG-only output'
  image_description: The plot displays a polar line chart showing monthly average
    temperature patterns for two cities (City A and City B) throughout the year. The
    visualization uses a circular layout with month labels (Jan-Dec) arranged clockwise
    around the perimeter starting from January on the right. Three concentric gray
    grid circles indicate temperature magnitude from the center outward, with 12 radial
    lines marking each month. City A is shown in dark blue (#306998) and City B in
    golden yellow (#FFD43B). Both series form closed polygons connecting temperature
    values month-by-month, clearly showing the seasonal pattern with peaks in summer
    months (Jun-Aug) and troughs in winter (Dec-Feb). City B consistently shows higher
    temperatures than City A. The title "polar-line · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. A legend labeled "Location" on the right identifies the two city series.
    The plot uses a void theme with a clean white background.

        comment: Properly uses ggplot grammar, geom_path, geom_point, geom_text, scale_color_manual,
          theme_void. However, the manual polar coordinate transformation is a workaround
          since lets-plot lacks native coord_polar(). This is acceptable but not showcasing
          lets-plot's strengths.
  verdict: APPROVED
