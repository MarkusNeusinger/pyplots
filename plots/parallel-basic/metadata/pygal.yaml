review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color palette (blue, yellow, teal) for the three
    species
  - Good use of Iris dataset which clearly demonstrates species clustering in parallel
    coordinates
  - Normalization properly implemented to make dimensions comparable
  - Mean lines for each species (thicker stroke) provide visual anchors among individual
    observations
  - Clean KISS code structure with well-organized custom style configuration
  - Properly generates both PNG and HTML outputs for pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format should start with spec-id: parallel-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai followed
    by subtitle'
  - Grid lines are barely visible despite configuration; could use higher contrast
    colors
  - High line density at axis intersection points reduces readability slightly
