review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of facet_grid to create the scatter matrix structure
  - Good color palette with Python-themed colors that are reasonably colorblind-safe
  - KDE curves on diagonal effectively show univariate distributions by species
  - Clean separation of scatter data and diagonal data for proper geom layering
  - Appropriate transparency and marker sizing for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly "scatter-matrix · plotnine · pyplots.ai" without
    the "Iris Dataset" prefix
  - Axis tick labels are too small (9pt) for high-resolution output - should be at
    least 12-14pt
  - Variable names appear only on top and right facet strips; spec requests labels
    on left and bottom edges
  - Code structure with nested loops is more complex than ideal KISS approach
