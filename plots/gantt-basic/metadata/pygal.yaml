review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear horizontal bars and proper spacing between
    tasks
  - Creative solution using SVG injection to implement Gantt chart in pygal (which
    lacks native Gantt support)
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent theming and proper font sizing at 4800x2700
  - Realistic software development project data with logical task sequences and overlaps
  - Clean color-coded categories with legend for easy interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color boxes are relatively small compared to the large canvas size
  - Missing current date vertical line marker mentioned in spec notes as a consideration
  - Red and green colors used together could be improved for colorblind accessibility
