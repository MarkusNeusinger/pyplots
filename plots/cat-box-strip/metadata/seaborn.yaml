review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions (different medians, spreads,
    and outliers) that demonstrate all boxplot features
  - Clean visual hierarchy with Python Blue boxes and contrasting Yellow strip points
  - Proper use of modern seaborn API (hue parameter with palette, legend=False)
  - Smart handling of outliers by hiding boxplot fliers (fliersize=0) since strip
    plot shows all points
  - Good jitter (0.2) and alpha (0.7) settings for strip points to show density without
    excessive overlap
  - Realistic manufacturing quality scenario with appropriate value ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could include both x and y axes for complete reference (minor)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a combined box plot with strip overlay showing
    quality scores across four manufacturing batches (A, B, C, D). The boxes are rendered
    in Python Blue (#306998) with the median line visible inside each box. Yellow
    (#FFD43B) circular data points with black edge outlines are overlaid on each box
    using jitter for horizontal spread. The title "cat-box-strip · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top. The x-axis shows "Manufacturing Batch" with
    four category labels, and the y-axis shows "Quality Score (points)" ranging from
    approximately 35 to 100. A subtle dashed grid is present on the y-axis. Each batch
    displays different distribution characteristics: Batch B shows a higher median
    with tight spread, Batch D shows the widest spread, and Batch C shows some lower
    outliers.'

        comment: Excellent use of seaborn's boxplot and stripplot combined with proper
          API (hue for palette), fliersize=0 to avoid duplicate outliers, and clean
          DataFrame integration
  verdict: APPROVED
