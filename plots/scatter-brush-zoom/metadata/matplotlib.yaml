review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of brush selection using matplotlib RectangleSelector
    widget with proper interactive=True mode
  - Well-designed visual feedback system with selected points highlighted in red and
    count displayed in status box
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette with clear cluster distinction
  - Proper instruction text guiding users on interaction capabilities
  - Clean integration of zoom/pan via native matplotlib toolbar
  weaknesses:
  - Code includes function definition (on_select callback) which technically violates
    KISS structure, though necessary for interactivity
  - Axis labels lack units (X Value, Y Value could be more descriptive)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an interactive scatter plot with three distinct
    clusters of data points on a 16:9 canvas. Cluster A (blue/navy, #306998) is positioned
    in the lower-left quadrant around x=2-4 and y=1.5-5. Cluster B (yellow/gold, #FFD43B)
    is spread across the right side around x=6-10 and y=4-9. Cluster C (green, #4CAF50)
    occupies the upper-middle region around x=4.5-7 and y=7-9.5. The title "scatter-brush-zoom
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top in large font.
    A status box in the upper-left shows "Selected: 0 points" with a rounded white
    background. Instruction text in italic gray at the upper-right reads "Drag to
    select • Scroll to zoom • Pan with toolbar". The legend is positioned in the lower-right
    corner showing all three cluster categories. Markers have white edge borders with
    ~70% opacity. A subtle dashed grid (alpha ~0.3) is visible. Axes are labeled "X
    Value" and "Y Value".'
