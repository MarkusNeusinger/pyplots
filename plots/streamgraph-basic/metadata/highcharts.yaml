review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of streamgraph with proper centered baseline and smooth
    flowing curves
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between genres
  - Realistic music streaming scenario with meaningful data trends (growth, decline,
    seasonal)
  - Proper title format and well-structured legend
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific StreamGraphSeries class
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could be tighter - generous margins mean the actual chart area is slightly
    smaller than optimal
  - X-axis lacks a descriptive label (though Month context is clear from labels)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a streamgraph (stacked area chart with centered baseline) showing music streaming trends over 24 months (Jan '23 to Dec '24). Five music genres are visualized as flowing, stacked layers:
    - **Pop** (blue, #306998) - top layer, largest area, relatively stable with slight seasonal variation
    - **Rock** (yellow, #FFD43B) - second layer, showing gradual decline over time
    - **Hip-Hop** (purple, #9467BD) - middle layer, showing growth trend over the period
    - **Electronic** (cyan, #17BECF) - fourth layer, with subtle seasonal oscillation
    - **Jazz** (pink, #E377C2) - bottom layer, smallest and most stable

    The chart has a white background with a clear title "Music Streaming Trends · streamgraph-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" and subtitle "Monthly streaming hours by genre (2023-2024)". X-axis shows month labels, y-axis is hidden (as typical for streamgraphs). A horizontal legend at the bottom identifies each genre.
