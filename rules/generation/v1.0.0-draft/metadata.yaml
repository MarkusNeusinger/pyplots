notes: |
  This is a DRAFT version created by extracting rules from existing documentation.

  Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY

  Next steps:
  1. Review and refine rules based on actual usage
  2. Test with real spec generation
  3. Gather feedback from generated plots
  4. Adjust criteria and rules as needed
  5. Promote to v1.0.0 when stable

  Known limitations:
  - Rules are based on documentation, not tested in practice
  - Quality criteria may need adjustment
  - Scoring thresholds might need calibration
  - Self-review checklist is preliminary
