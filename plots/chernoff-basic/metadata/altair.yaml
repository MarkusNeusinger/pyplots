review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of Altair layered marks to construct face components from points
  - Proper feature mapping legend explaining variable-to-facial-feature correspondence
  - Good color coding by species with clear legend
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Face shapes are circular (all same shape) - should vary face width/height more
    visibly based on the encoded variables
  - Faces appear somewhat small relative to canvas with significant empty space in
    upper portion
  - Sample labels could be more descriptive (e.g., include species name)
