review:
  strengths:
  - Creative polygon approach to create band effect in pygal which lacks native fill_between
    functionality
  - Significantly improved band visibility with opacity 0.65 - previous feedback addressed
  - Central trend line is now prominent with stroke_width=6 and contrasting yellow
    color
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Realistic scenario showing widening uncertainty over time
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very faint/barely visible despite show_x_guides and show_y_guides
    being enabled
  - The polygon closure at the right edge creates a visual artifact (sharp point at
    x=10)
