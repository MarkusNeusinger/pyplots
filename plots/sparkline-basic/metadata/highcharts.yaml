review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimal sparkline design with no chart chrome (axes, gridlines) per specification
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color choices (orange for min, teal for max instead
    of red/green)
  - Three reference markers (start, min, max) enhance data comprehension without cluttering
  - Realistic data pattern with trend + cyclical + noise components
  - Proper use of Highcharts scatter series for point markers separate from main line
  - Good line width (10) and marker sizes for visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area instead of highcharts_core.options.series.line
  - Missing last point marker (specification mentions optional first/last points for
    reference - only first is shown)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sparkline chart with a continuous blue line
    (#306998) showing a trend pattern over approximately 60 data points. The line
    exhibits a clear pattern with an initial dip, mid-chart low point, then an upward
    trend with cyclical variations. Three marker points are visible: a gray circle
    at the start (first point), an orange circle at the minimum value (around the
    middle-left of the chart), and a teal/cyan circle at the maximum value (in the
    upper-right portion). The title "sparkline-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is
    displayed at the top in bold text. No axes, gridlines, or labels are present,
    consistent with sparkline design principles. The chart has a clean white background.'

        comment: Good use of Highcharts chart options, separate scatter series for
          markers, proper axis hiding. Could leverage Highcharts sparkline-specific
          features.
  verdict: APPROVED
