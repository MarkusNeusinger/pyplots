review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with opacity hierarchy and annotation highlighting
    the bimodal Engineering distribution
  - Four distinct distribution shapes (bimodal, narrow, wide, low) thoroughly demonstrate
    violin plot capabilities
  - Clean professional aesthetic with plotly_white template, subtle gridlines, and
    custom color palette
  - All font sizes explicitly set at appropriate values for the output resolution
  - Realistic salary-by-department context with plausible values
  - Clean KISS code structure with minimal well-organized code
  weaknesses:
  - Three violins at 0.6 opacity are slightly less vivid than they could be
  - Red-green color pair presents a minor colorblind accessibility concern despite
    lightness mitigation
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally, comparing
    annual salary distributions across four departments: Engineering (steel blue,
    #306998), Marketing (orange, #E8873D), Sales (muted red/coral, #C44E52), and Support
    (sage green, #6AAB73). Engineering is shown with higher opacity (0.85) to emphasize
    its bimodal distribution, while the other three are at 0.6 opacity. Each violin
    contains a white box plot showing quartiles, median (solid line), and mean (dashed
    line). An annotation with an arrow points to the Engineering violin reading "Bimodal:
    two salary clusters at ~75k & ~92k." The title "violin-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at top. Y-axis shows "Annual Salary ($)" with dollar-formatted ticks
    from ~$20,000 to $140,000+. X-axis shows "Department" with category labels. Background
    is clean white (plotly_white template) with very subtle horizontal gridlines.
    The Sales violin is the tallest/widest (high variance), Support is the narrowest
    and lowest, and Engineering clearly shows two density peaks.'
