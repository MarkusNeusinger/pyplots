review:
  strengths:
  - Clear demonstration of rug plot concept showing exact data point locations
  - Excellent data generation with realistic clustering patterns (main cluster, slower
    responses, outliers)
  - Proper title format and x-axis labeling with units
  - Clean, readable code structure with good comments
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.85) for overlapping ticks
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical y-axis line visible on left side is distracting for a rug plot (should
    be hidden)
  - Rug ticks only fill ~20% of vertical canvas; poor space utilization despite y-range
    adjustment
  - Not leveraging pygal distinctive SVG/interactive features beyond basic rendering
