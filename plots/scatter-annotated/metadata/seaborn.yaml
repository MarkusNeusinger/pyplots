review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of adjustText library for automatic label positioning with subtle
    connecting lines
  - Proper seaborn theming with whitegrid and colorblind palette
  - Text sizes optimized for the 4800x2700 resolution
  - Realistic tech company scenario matching spec application examples
  - Good marker sizing (s=200) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (consider reducing grid alpha or using a lighter
    style)
