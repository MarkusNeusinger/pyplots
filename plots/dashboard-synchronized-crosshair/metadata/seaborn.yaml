review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent synchronized crosshair demonstration with consistent red styling across
    all three charts
  - Professional annotation boxes with clear value display at crosshair position
  - Well-structured 3-panel layout with appropriate height ratios (2:1:1) for dashboard
    feel
  - Good use of seaborn styling context and line plots for clean aesthetics
  - RSI chart includes reference lines and shaded neutral zone for technical analysis
    context
  - Up/down volume coloring adds meaningful information
  weaknesses:
  - RSI legend font is relatively small (12pt) compared to other text elements
  - Volume bars use matplotlib bar() directly instead of seaborn barplot function
  image_description: The plot shows a multi-chart dashboard with three vertically
    stacked panels sharing a common x-axis (Date from late 2023 to October 2024).
    The top panel displays a blue line chart for Price ($) with a light blue area
    fill, showing values ranging from approximately 0-110. The middle panel shows
    a bar chart for Volume with bars colored in blue and yellow (indicating up/down
    price movements), formatted in millions (0M-20M+). The bottom panel displays a
    purple line chart for RSI with horizontal reference lines at 70 (Overbought, red
    dotted) and 30 (Oversold, green dotted), with a gray shaded neutral zone between
    them. A synchronized red dashed vertical crosshair line spans all three charts
    at the same x-position (around June 2024), with red circular markers and annotation
    boxes showing values at each chart ($82.29, 8.2M, 57.9). The title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. A small italic note at the
    bottom right reads "Synchronized crosshair shown at highlighted position."

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot for line charts with seaborn styling (sns.set_style,
          sns.set_context), but volume bars use matplotlib directly rather than seaborn's
          barplot
