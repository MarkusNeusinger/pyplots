review:
  strengths:
  - Layered gradient fill using sns.light_palette is a creative and distinctive use
    of seaborn's color utilities, creating visual depth beyond a simple fill_between
  - Strong data storytelling with the Viral post annotation and monthly average reference
    line providing clear narrative context
  - Realistic web traffic data with weekly seasonality, upward trend, and spike that
    showcases multiple area chart features
  - 'Professional visual refinement: despined axes, subtle grid, thousands separators,
    rotated date labels, consistent color scheme'
  - All text sizes explicitly set to appropriate values for the 4800x2700 output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Gradient fill layers are individually faint at alpha=0.12, making the area visual
    weight less prominent than it could be — slightly higher alpha or fewer layers
    with higher opacity would strengthen the filled area effect
  - The Viral post annotation arrow spans a large empty region of the upper-left canvas,
    creating slight visual imbalance in that quadrant
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart of daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 data points). A dark blue line (#306998) traces visitor
    counts from ~5,000 to over 10,000, with a layered gradient fill beneath composed
    of 5 progressively darker blue bands created via sns.light_palette. The x-axis
    shows dates labeled "Date" with Monday-aligned major ticks (Jan 01, Jan 08, Jan
    15, Jan 22, Jan 29) rotated ~30 degrees. The y-axis shows "Visitors (count)" from
    0 to ~10,500 with thousands separators. The title reads "area-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" at 24pt. A "Viral post" annotation in semibold dark blue with a
    curved arrow points to the traffic spike around Jan 18 (~10,400 visitors). A dashed
    horizontal line marks the monthly average (~5,733) with an italic label at the
    right edge. Weekly patterns are clearly visible with weekend dips. Top and right
    spines are removed. Y-axis gridlines are subtle (alpha=0.2). The overall layout
    is well-balanced on a white background with the plot filling most of the 16:9
    canvas.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot, sns.set_theme, sns.despine, sns.light_palette.
          Core area fill uses matplotlib fill_between since seaborn lacks native area
          chart.

        comment: sns.light_palette for gradient generation and sns.set_theme with
          rc dict are distinctively seaborn features.
