review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of parallel categories using matplotlib low-level Path
    API with smooth bezier curve ribbons
  - Clean visual design with dark navy category bars and white text labels
  - Proper ribbon width proportional to observation counts showing flow patterns
  - Good color coding by source channel with appropriate transparency for overlapping
    ribbons
  - Realistic e-commerce customer journey scenario (Channel → Category → Outcome)
  - Title follows exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Online (blue) and Mobile (lighter blue) colors in legend are too similar and could
    be confused; recommend using more distinct colors like green for Mobile
  - The second-hop ribbon coloring logic uses mode() which may not accurately trace
    back the original channel for all flows
