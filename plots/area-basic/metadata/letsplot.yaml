  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with peak/dip annotations, LOESS trend line, and narrative
    subtitle conveying the growth story
  - Strong idiomatic lets-plot usage with layer_tooltips() for interactive HTML export
    — a distinctive library feature
  - Clean minimal theme with well-chosen Python Blue palette and carefully set font
    sizes for the 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic, engaging dataset with clear weekly cyclical patterns and upward trend
    that demonstrates the area chart strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Peak annotation and marker are crowded against the top-right canvas edge — needs
    more y-axis headroom or repositioned annotation
  - Right margin is too tight with the peak label extending to the edge — canvas padding
    or label positioning should be adjusted
  - The annotation code for peak and dip is somewhat repetitive (geom_point + geom_text
    duplicated) — could be more concise
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024. The area is filled with semi-transparent Python Blue (#306998,
    alpha 0.45) beneath a solid blue line (size 1.8). A dashed darker blue LOESS trend
    line overlays the data, showing the upward trajectory. Weekly cyclical patterns
    are clearly visible with peaks and troughs repeating roughly every 7 days, superimposed
    on a steady upward trend. Two annotated data points stand out: a red circle marker
    at the minimum (~Jan 06) labeled "▼ 4,299 dip" in red text, and a blue circle
    marker at the peak (~Jan 30) labeled "▲ 7,694 peak" in dark blue text. The title
    reads "area-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "+15% average growth
    over January — weekly cycles with steady upward trend." The x-axis is labeled
    "Date" with bi-daily tick labels (Jan 01, Jan 03, etc.), the y-axis is labeled
    "Daily Visitors" ranging from ~3,600 to ~7,800 with horizontal gridlines. The
    layout is 16:9 landscape with a minimal theme — no x-gridlines, subtle gray y-gridlines,
    no minor gridlines. The peak annotation and marker are crowded against the top-right
    edge of the canvas.'
