review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all forest plot requirements: diamond pooled estimate,
    weighted markers, reference line, CI whiskers'
  - Clear, professional layout with study labels and effect sizes displayed in readable
    format
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot for weighted point estimates with size mapping
  - Proper directional annotations help interpret the plot
  - Realistic meta-analysis data with chronological study names and varied effect
    sizes
  weaknesses:
  - sns.set_style called after plt.subplots (should be called before for idiomatic
    seaborn usage)
  - Layout could be slightly tighter on the right side to reduce whitespace
