review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh jitter transform for categorical scatter
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas - all elements clearly visible
  - Realistic manufacturing quality control scenario with varied distributions
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool to show exact values on hover leveraging Bokeh interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical strip plot with 5 manufacturing
    batches (A through E) on the x-axis and Quality Score (ranging from approximately
    45-97) on the y-axis. Points are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998) with
    darker blue outlines. Each batch shows individual data points with horizontal
    jitter applied to reduce overlap. The distributions vary: Batch C shows the highest
    and tightest clustering (~90-97), Batch D shows the widest spread with some low
    outliers (~47-87), Batch A and E show medium-high scores, and Batch B shows medium
    scores with moderate spread. The title "cat-strip · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal
    grid lines. The Bokeh toolbar is visible in the top right corner.'

        comment: Uses jitter transform and ColumnDataSource which are Bokeh-specific,
          but could leverage more Bokeh features like HoverTool for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
