review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud above, box on baseline, and rain below for
    each category
  - 'Excellent data variety: bimodal (Treatment B), tight unimodal (Treatment A),
    wide spread (Treatment C), outliers (Control)'
  - Properly explicit font sizing throughout (title 32pt, labels 24pt, ticks 20pt)
  - Good use of Plotly violin side parameter for cloud/rain separation technique
  - Clean code structure with well-organized loop for trace creation
  - Interactive HTML export with range slider adds value for Plotly interactive ecosystem
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) has poor contrast against white background, reducing visibility
    of Treatment B rain points
  - 'No annotations or storytelling: the bimodal distribution in Treatment B and outliers
    are significant findings that should be highlighted'
  - Color palette lacks cohesion — the jump from blues to yellow to gray feels arbitrary
    rather than designed
  - Jitter value (0.15) exceeds the spec recommended range (0.05-0.1)
  - The violin-as-rain-points hack (width=0 with points=all) is clever but not clean
  image_description: 'The plot displays four horizontal raincloud plots for experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) arranged from bottom
    to top on the y-axis, with Reaction Time (ms) on the x-axis ranging from 200 to
    700. Each condition features a half-violin (cloud) extending upward from the category
    baseline in a semi-transparent fill, a narrow white box plot with dark outlines
    centered on the baseline showing median and quartiles, and jittered scatter points
    (rain) falling below the baseline. Colors are: Control in dark blue (#306998),
    Treatment A in light blue (#4B8BBE), Treatment B in yellow (#FFD43B), and Treatment
    C in gray (#646464). Treatment B clearly shows a bimodal distribution with two
    peaks. Control and Treatment C have visible outlier points. The title "raincloud-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend titled "Condition" appears
    in the upper-right corner. The background is clean white with subtle vertical
    gridlines. The layout uses generous margins with good canvas utilization.'

        comment: Violin shapes and box plots well-sized. Rain points visible but some
          light blue points against white background have slightly reduced visibility.

        comment: Yellow (#FFD43B) has low contrast against white background. No red-green
          issue but bright yellow on white is a contrast concern.

        comment: Plot fills roughly 40-50% of canvas. Some wasted vertical space between
          categories. Adequate but not perfectly balanced.
