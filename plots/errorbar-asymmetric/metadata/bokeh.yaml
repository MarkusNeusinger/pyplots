review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent asymmetric error bar visualization with clear visual distinction between
    upper and lower bounds
  - Professional financial forecasting context that perfectly demonstrates asymmetric
    uncertainty
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper use of ColumnDataSource
  - Good color contrast between yellow markers and blue error bars
  - Appropriate use of Bokeh's Whisker model for error bar rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears smaller than optimal relative to the large canvas size
  - Manual cap implementation could leverage Bokeh's built-in Whisker head customization
    more elegantly
  image_description: The plot displays quarterly revenue forecasts from Q1 2024 to
    Q2 2025 with asymmetric error bars. Yellow/gold circular markers represent median
    forecast values, connected by blue vertical error bars with horizontal caps at
    both ends. The error bars clearly demonstrate asymmetry - with larger downside
    uncertainty (extending further below) than upside potential. The title "errorbar-asymmetric
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis shows quarters, y-axis shows
    "Revenue Forecast ($ millions)" ranging from ~10 to ~21. A legend in the top-left
    explains the markers as "Median forecast (10th-90th percentile)". The background
    is white with subtle dashed grid lines.

        comment: Uses Whisker model correctly but implementation is fairly basic;
          manual cap drawing instead of using Whisker's built-in head properties more
          creatively
  verdict: APPROVED
