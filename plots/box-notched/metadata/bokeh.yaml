review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of notched box plots using Bokeh primitives (quad, patch,
    segment)
  - Notch calculation correctly implements ±1.57 × IQR / √n formula per specification
  - Clean visual design with appropriate sizing for 4800×2700 canvas
  - Proper colorblind-friendly palette with five distinct hues
  - Outliers correctly identified and rendered with contrasting hollow circle style
  weaknesses:
  - Unused variable xs (lines 135-146) is dead code that should be removed
  - Y-axis label lacks units (should be Performance Score 0-100 or similar)
  - Some generated outlier values exceed 100, which is unrealistic for a 0-100 performance
    scale
  - No legend mapping colors to departments (though categories on x-axis partially
    compensate)
