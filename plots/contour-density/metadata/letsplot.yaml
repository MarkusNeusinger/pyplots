review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of three distinct density clusters with clear concentric
    contour lines
  - Good use of scatter overlay with low alpha providing context without overwhelming
    the contours
  - Proper ggplot2-style grammar with geom_density2d following lets-plot conventions
  - Axis labels include appropriate units (°C, %) and are descriptive
  - 'Title follows the exact required format: spec-id · library · pyplots.ai'
  - Realistic temperature/humidity scenario with sensible data ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter point alpha could be slightly lower (0.2) for better contour visibility
    in dense areas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density contour visualization on a light
    gray background with subtle grid lines. Three distinct clusters are visible through
    concentric blue contour lines (#306998 color): one in the upper-left area centered
    around ~15°C/80% humidity (small, dense cluster), one in the lower-center area
    around ~22°C/55% humidity (large, dense cluster with many contour levels), and
    one on the right side around ~32°C/75% humidity (more diffuse cluster). Yellow-gold
    scatter points (#FFD43B) with low alpha are overlaid showing the underlying data
    distribution. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from ~8 to 46, and the
    y-axis shows "Relative Humidity (%)" ranging from ~35 to 100. The title "contour-density
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.'
