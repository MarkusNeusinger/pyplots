review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all features from the specification are faithfully
    implemented including 270-degree arc, ring fills, sector headers, shape encoding,
    and dual legend
  - Strong design with graduated ring tints, leader lines, and multi-encoded data
    (color + shape) creating clear visual hierarchy
  - Realistic, current technology data with plausible ring assignments that tell a
    coherent story
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: interactive hover with conditional size,
    tooltips, and HTML export'
  weaknesses:
  - Label overlap in crowded areas (AI & ML Adopt/Trial zone, Security sector) — LLM
    Agents / AI Code Review labels clash
  - Green and orange sector colors may be confusable under protanopia; consider using
    a fully colorblind-safe palette
  - Verbose label rendering with three separate chart layers for left/center/right
    alignment
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree radial "innovation radar" chart
    on a square canvas. Four concentric ring bands (Adopt innermost, Trial, Assess,
    Hold outermost) are filled with subtle graduated blue tints that fade from ~18%
    opacity in the center to ~2% at the outer edge. Grey spoke lines divide the angular
    space into 4 equal sectors labeled in bold at the outer edge: Data Engineering
    (upper-left), Cloud & Infra (upper-right), AI & ML (right), and Security (lower-left).
    26 technology items are plotted as colored markers — blue circles/diamonds/triangles/squares
    for AI & ML, orange for Cloud & Infra, green for Data Engineering, and purple
    for Security — with shapes encoding the ring (circle=Adopt, diamond=Trial, triangle=Assess,
    square=Hold). Each marker has a thin leader line connecting to its text label,
    which is aligned outward from the center. Ring names (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold)
    appear in the gap area at the bottom. A dual legend at the bottom shows Sector
    (colors) and Ring (shapes). The title "radar-innovation-timeline · altair · pyplots.ai"
    sits at the top center.'
