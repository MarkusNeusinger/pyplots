review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex visualization using polygon primitives
  - Creative approach building violin shapes from KDE using scipy and PolygonSeries
  - 'Diverse data showcasing all features: bimodal distribution, outliers, different
    spreads'
  - Colorblind-safe palette
  - 'All spec requirements met: violin KDE, embedded box plot, median markers, whiskers,
    outliers'
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines visible, which would improve value readability
  - Some unused whitespace at top of plot area
