review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors and appropriate line widths
  - All specification requirements fully implemented including nested confidence bands
  - Good use of annotation for Forecast Start label
  - Proper use of fill=toself pattern for confidence bands
  - Connection line between historical and forecast smoothly bridges the transition
  - HTML export included for interactive exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Legend representation for CI bands shows as lines without fill, which is slightly
    misleading since the bands are filled areas
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features (range selector, spike
    lines, or unified hover mode improvements)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series forecast with uncertainty bands
    for monthly sales data. The x-axis shows dates ranging from January 2023 to late
    2026, and the y-axis shows "Monthly Sales (Units)" ranging from approximately
    100 to 240. The historical data is represented by a solid blue line (#306998)
    showing monthly values from January 2023 to December 2025 with clear trend (upward)
    and seasonality (sinusoidal pattern). A dashed vertical gray line marks "Forecast
    Start" at January 2026, with an annotation label above. The forecast period (January
    2026 onwards) shows a dashed yellow/gold line (#FFD43B) for the predicted values.
    Two nested uncertainty bands surround the forecast: a darker yellow band for 80%
    CI and a lighter yellow band for 95% CI. Both bands widen over time, correctly
    representing increasing uncertainty. A dotted line connects the last historical
    point to the first forecast point. The legend is positioned in the upper-left
    corner with a semi-transparent white background, showing all four elements (95%
    CI, 80% CI, Historical, Forecast). The title "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.'
