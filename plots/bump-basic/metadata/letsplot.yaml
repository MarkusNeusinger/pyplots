review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of direct labeling on the right side instead of legend, improving
    readability
  - Clean inverted Y-axis with rank 1 at top as specified
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color
  - Proper implementation of bump chart pattern with lines connecting same entity
    across periods
  - Well-sized elements (line width 2.5, point size 6) for clear visibility
  - Correct title format and output specifications (PNG at 4800x2700 via scale=3)
  weaknesses:
  - Right margin could be slightly wider to prevent labels from appearing too close
    to plot edge
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features in the HTML output
  - Data shows limited dramatic position changes - more crossovers would better demonstrate
    bump chart capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing rankings of 5 tech companies
    (Alpha Corp, Beta Inc, Gamma Tech, Delta Systems, Epsilon Labs) over 6 quarters
    (Q1-Q6). The Y-axis is correctly inverted with rank 1 at the top and rank 5 at
    the bottom. Each company is represented by a distinct colored line: dark blue
    (Alpha Corp), yellow (Beta Inc), green (Gamma Tech), purple (Delta Systems), and
    pink (Epsilon Labs). Lines connect rankings across time periods with dot markers
    at each data point. Company labels appear on the right side of the chart at their
    final positions. The title "bump-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The layout is clean with a minimal theme and subtle grid.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar correctly with geom_line, geom_point, geom_text,
          scale_y_reverse, and theme customization. Uses ggsize and scale=3 for proper
          export. Could leverage more interactive features.
  verdict: APPROVED
