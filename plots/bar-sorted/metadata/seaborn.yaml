review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal layout choice for long category labels, following spec recommendation
  - Value labels positioned cleanly at the end of each bar with proper formatting
    ($XXXk)
  - Correct use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clear visual hierarchy with descending sort from largest to smallest
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principle
  - X-axis extended appropriately to prevent label clipping
  weaknesses:
  - Uses monochromatic palette instead of seaborn built-in color palettes like colorblind
    or Blues which could add visual interest
  - Grid uses dashed linestyle which is slightly more prominent than recommended
  image_description: The plot shows a horizontal bar chart displaying 10 product categories
    sorted by sales in descending order. Electronics leads at $450k, followed by Clothing
    ($380k), Home & Garden ($320k), Sports ($275k), Books ($240k), Toys ($210k), Beauty
    ($185k), Automotive ($150k), Food & Grocery ($120k), and Pet Supplies ($95k).
    All bars are a consistent steel blue color (#306998). The title "bar-sorted ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis shows "Product Category"
    and x-axis shows "Sales (thousands $)". Value labels are positioned at the end
    of each bar. A subtle dashed grid appears on the x-axis with alpha=0.3. The layout
    is clean with good proportions - the plot fills the canvas well.
