review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, visually appealing color scheme using seaborn color palette
  - Clear hierarchy representation with three distinct levels
  - Excellent label placement with white background boxes for category names
  - Realistic business context (product category sales)
  - Well-designed legend explaining hierarchy levels
  weaknesses:
  - Subcategory circles extend outside their parent category circles - violates the
    fundamental circle packing constraint that children should be contained within
    parents
  - Uses helper functions (get_children, calculate_total_value) instead of KISS flat
    script structure
  - Relies almost entirely on matplotlib.patches for drawing - seaborn is only used
    for styling, not for any actual plotting functions
  - Circle sizes not perfectly proportional to values across different parents
