review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using pygal XML filter to render custom SVG circles on top of
    a base chart
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow) with clear hierarchy distinction
  - Realistic organizational data that demonstrates the visualization effectively
  - Correct title format and proper SVG/PNG output
  weaknesses:
  - '"No data" text artifact appears prominently in the center from the empty Pie
    chart base - must be hidden or removed'
  - Team circles overlap within departments instead of being efficiently packed without
    overlap
  - Some department labels are obscured by child circles
  - Code uses functions instead of KISS linear structure
