review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent ggplot2 grammar of graphics implementation with clean layer composition
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.7 for boxes, 0.6 for jitter points) to show
    overlay clearly
  - Well-designed data showcasing different distribution characteristics (tight vs
    wide spread, outliers, bimodal)
  - Proper figure sizing (16, 9) and font sizes following library guidelines
  - Color palette is visually appealing and accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Grid is barely visible (nearly invisible), could use slightly higher alpha for
    better reference
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box plot with strip overlay showing plant
    growth (cm) across four treatment groups: Control (blue), Fertilizer A (yellow),
    Fertilizer B (light blue), and Fertilizer C (green). Each category has a colored
    box showing median, quartiles, and whiskers, with individual data points (jittered)
    overlaid on top. The title "cat-box-strip · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. X-axis is labeled "Treatment Group" and Y-axis is labeled "Plant Growth
    (cm)". A legend on the right identifies each fertilizer type. The Control group
    shows lower values (~15-35 cm), Fertilizer A shows moderate improvement (~25-45
    cm), Fertilizer B shows tighter distribution (~38-52 cm), and Fertilizer C shows
    highest values with some outliers (~27-55 cm).'
