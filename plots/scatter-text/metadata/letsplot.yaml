review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text positioning with no overlapping labels
  - Creative use of layer_tooltips() for interactive hover information showing language
    details
  - Meaningful data context with programming languages positioned by paradigm/abstraction
  - Good color palette with clear category differentiation
  - Bold text formatting enhances readability
  - Properly generates both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Duplicate legends appear on the right (category with circles + Primary Use with
    colored circles) creating visual confusion
  - The category legend shows circles of increasing size which is misleading since
    size is not used as a data encoding
  image_description: 'The plot displays 30 programming language names positioned as
    text labels in a 2D space. The x-axis represents the programming paradigm spectrum
    (Object-Oriented ← Paradigm → Functional, ranging 0-1), and the y-axis represents
    Abstraction Level (Low → High, ranging 0.1-0.95). Each language name is colored
    according to its category: General (blue), Web (yellow/gold), Systems (teal),
    Mobile (magenta/pink), Functional (orange), Scripting (red), Data Science (light
    blue), Scientific (olive green), and Legacy (gray). The title "scatter-text ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. Two legends appear on the right
    side - one showing "category" with circles of increasing size (incorrectly showing
    circles instead of just colors), and one showing "Primary Use" with colored circles
    correctly mapping to categories. The layout uses a minimal theme with subtle orange
    gridlines. Languages like Assembly, COBOL, and Fortran cluster in the low-abstraction,
    object-oriented corner, while Haskell, Ruby, and Elixir appear in the high-abstraction,
    functional corner. All text labels are legible with bold formatting and appropriate
    spacing.'
