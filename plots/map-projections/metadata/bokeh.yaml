review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent educational demonstration of projection distortion through Tissot indicatrices
  - Clean 2x2 grid layout comparing four distinct projections effectively
  - Mathematically correct projection formulas including Newton-Raphson for Mollweide
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and gridplot for multi-panel layouts
  - Dual output format (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh interactive capabilities
  - Clear color scheme with appropriate contrast and colorblind-safe colors
  weaknesses:
  - Missing actual world coastlines/country borders as mentioned in specification
    (only shows graticule grid)
  - Legend only appears in first panel, making other panels lack context when viewed
    individually
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 2x2 grid of world map projections rendered using Bokeh. The main title "map-projections · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is displayed in blue (#306998) at the top, with a subtitle explaining the visualization. The four projections shown are:

    1. **Equirectangular (Plate Carrée)** - top left: Shows a rectangular grid with uniform spacing, yellow Tissot indicatrices of equal size throughout
    2. **Mercator** - top right: Shows vertical lines with horizontal lines that become more compressed toward poles, Tissot circles grow dramatically larger toward high latitudes (showing area distortion)
    3. **Sinusoidal** - bottom left: Shows an oval/elliptical shape with curved meridians converging at poles, Tissot circles maintain consistent size (equal-area) but become more elliptical toward edges (shape distortion)
    4. **Mollweide** - bottom right: Shows an elliptical projection with curved meridians, Tissot indicatrices show moderate shape distortion while preserving area

    Blue graticule lines (#306998) are drawn at 30° intervals. Yellow Tissot indicatrices (#FFD43B) with semi-transparent fill visualize how each projection distorts circles into ellipses. Background is light gray (#f5f5f5) with white borders. The legend in the first panel explains graticule and Tissot elements.
