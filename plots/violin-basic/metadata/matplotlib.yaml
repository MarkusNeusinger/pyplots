review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario with test scores across schools - immediately comprehensible
  - Clear visual hierarchy with yellow median lines contrasting well against blue
    violins
  - Proper quartile visualization with IQR bars inside violins
  - Text sizes perfectly calibrated for 4800x2700 output
  - Good variation in distributions showing different spread and center characteristics
  weaknesses:
  - Test score values exceeding 100 are unrealistic for typical percentage-based scoring
  - Could use matplotlib built-in quartile visualization (showquartiles parameter)
    instead of manual vlines
  - Missing legend element (though not critical for this plot type)
  image_description: The plot displays four violin plots comparing test score distributions
    across four schools (School A, B, C, D). The violins are rendered in a muted blue
    color (#306998) with slight transparency (alpha 0.7). Each violin shows the kernel
    density estimation shape, with School C being the widest (indicating highest variance)
    and School B being narrower (lower variance). Yellow horizontal lines mark the
    median values inside each violin. Dark blue vertical bars indicate the interquartile
    range (Q1 to Q3). Vertical lines extend to min/max values. The title "violin-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis is labeled "School" and
    Y-axis is labeled "Test Score (points)". A subtle horizontal dashed grid is present.
    The layout is well-balanced with good proportions.

        comment: Uses basic violinplot() but doesn't leverage matplotlib's more advanced
          violin customization like bw_method for bandwidth, widths parameter, or
          vert parameter. The manual IQR overlay is a good touch but could use matplotlib's
          built-in showquartiles parameter.
  verdict: APPROVED
