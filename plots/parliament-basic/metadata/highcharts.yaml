review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of parliament seats in semicircular arcs
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color distinction between parties
  - Legend clearly shows party names with seat counts
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Neutral fictional party names avoid political controversy
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  - Clean use of Highcharts scatter series for individual seats
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a helper function calculate_seat_positions instead of inline code (violates
    KISS structure requirement)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    280 total seats arranged in 5 concentric arcs. Six parties are represented with
    distinct colors: Progressive Alliance (blue, 85 seats) on the left, Unity Party
    (yellow, 72 seats), Liberty Coalition (purple, 48 seats), Green Forum (green,
    35 seats), Social Democrats (cyan, 28 seats), and Reform Movement (brown, 12 seats)
    on the right. Each seat is rendered as an individual circular dot with a subtle
    dark border. The title "parliament-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top center with a subtitle showing "Total Seats: 280". A vertical legend on
    the right side lists all parties with their seat counts. The semicircle is well-proportioned
    on a white background.'
