review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent decision boundary visualization with clear separation between blue and
    yellow regions
  - Good use of different marker shapes (circles for Class 0, diamonds for Class 1)
    to distinguish classes
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette using blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
  - 'Title follows correct format: contour-decision-boundary · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Clean heatmap implementation showing probability gradients through the decision
    space
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label (Feature X1) is missing - only Y-axis label (Feature X2) is visible
  - Color axis legend on right side shows truncated values (1.0 and 0.0 partially
    visible)
  - Legend box with Training Data title and class names is not visible in the rendered
    image
