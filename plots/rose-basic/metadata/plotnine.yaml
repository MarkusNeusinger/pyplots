review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of rose chart using plotnine polygon geometry approach
  - Clean visual design with subtle gridlines and well-positioned month labels
  - Correct radius-proportional encoding as specified (not area)
  - Proper clockwise arrangement starting from January at 12 o'clock
  - Effective blue-to-yellow color gradient based on rainfall values
  - Good use of gaps between wedges for visual separation
  - Realistic monthly rainfall data with meaningful seasonal variation
  weaknesses:
  - Value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) are positioned only on one spoke, making them
    less visible
  - Figure size is 12x12 at 300 DPI (3600x3600) which is acceptable but the spec prefers
    16x9 for landscape or explicit 3600x3600 for square
  - Could use plotnine built-in theme functions more extensively
