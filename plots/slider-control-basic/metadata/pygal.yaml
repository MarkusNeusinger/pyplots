quality_score: 45
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with clear, readable text and good color choices
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Realistic business sales data with seasonal patterns and growth trends
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of pygal Style customization for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Pygal cannot implement interactive slider controls - it is a static
    SVG library without widget support'
  - The implementation shows a static grouped bar chart instead of the required slider-controlled
    interactive visualization
  - This specification requires JavaScript-based interactivity that pygal fundamentally
    lacks - consider marking as not-feasible
