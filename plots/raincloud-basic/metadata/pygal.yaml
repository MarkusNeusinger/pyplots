  strengths:
  - 'Raincloud metaphor is visually clear: clouds rise above, rain falls below each
    category baseline'
  - Median annotations with dashed leader lines and the 100 ms faster insight callout
    add genuine data storytelling
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow/green palette with good luminance contrast
  - Creative SVG post-processing approach that works around pygal limitations for
    custom shapes
  - Horizontal orientation and all spec requirements fully met
  weaknesses:
  - Box plots are thin and low-contrast, making them hard to distinguish from the
    baseline — increasing fill opacity or stroke width would improve visibility
  - The SVG coordinate mapping relies on regex parsing with hardcoded fallbacks, which
    is fragile
  - Heavy SVG post-processing means most visual elements bypass pygal API, reducing
    library mastery score
  - The Control group cloud extends very wide due to outliers, creating an asymmetric
    look compared to other groups
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud chart titled "raincloud-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". Three treatment groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment
    B) are arranged on the y-axis with Reaction Time (ms) on the x-axis ranging from
    ~200 to ~700 ms. Each group features: (1) a semi-transparent half-violin KDE "cloud"
    extending upward from the category baseline — blue for Control, yellow/gold for
    Treatment A, green for Treatment B; (2) jittered scatter dots ("rain") below the
    baseline in matching saturated colors; (3) a thin box plot with whiskers centered
    on the baseline, filled with a very light tint of the group color. Median annotations
    appear above each cloud (432 ms for Control, 378 ms for Treatment A, 331 ms for
    Treatment B) connected by dashed leader lines. A callout box in the upper-right
    reads "▼ 100 ms faster" with a dashed green arrow pointing toward Treatment B''s
    median. The background is white with subtle dashed vertical guide lines. The raincloud
    metaphor (cloud above, rain below) is clearly realized for all three groups.'
