review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 180-degree rotational symmetry for black cells
  - Proper clue numbering algorithm that identifies cells starting across/down words
  - Clean monochrome design ideal for printing
  - Good use of custom SVG generation when pygal native charts cannot directly represent
    the crossword grid
  - Appropriate square 1:1 aspect ratio for crossword cells
  - HTML output provides interactive viewing option
  weaknesses:
  - pygal library usage is minimal (only used for style and initial chart setup);
    the actual grid rendering is done via custom SVG
  - Could benefit from slightly larger clue numbers for improved readability at smaller
    display sizes
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with a proper
    newspaper-style layout. The grid shows white entry cells and black blocking cells
    arranged with 180-degree rotational symmetry. Clue numbers (1-67) are positioned
    in the top-left corners of cells that start across or down words. The title "crossword-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. The grid has clean, uniform
    dark gray borders separating all cells. The square format is appropriate for a
    crossword puzzle, and the monochrome design (black/white cells with gray text
    and borders) is optimized for printing.

          rendering, though final output is custom SVG since pygal cannot directly
