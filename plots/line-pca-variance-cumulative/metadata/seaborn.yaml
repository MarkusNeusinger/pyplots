review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with the annotated 95% crossing point — the curved
    arrow and boxed label immediately communicate the key insight
  - Real Wine dataset provides authentic PCA results instead of synthetic data
  - 'Strong visual design: cohesive color palette, custom marker styling (white fill,
    blue edge), distinct dash patterns for each threshold'
  - Good use of optional bar overlay showing individual variance ratios as specified
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized sections
  weaknesses:
  - Manual legend construction is verbose and fragile — could be simplified
  - Layout has some wasted space in the upper-left quadrant where the cumulative line
    hasn't reached yet
  - The bars at alpha=0.2 are very faint and hard to read individual values from
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA component selection using the Wine dataset. A blue line with white-filled
    circle markers (blue edge) traces the cumulative variance from approximately 36%
    at component 1 up to nearly 100% at component 13. Light blue semi-transparent
    bars underneath show individual variance per component, decreasing from ~36% (component
    1) down to near zero. An orange dashed horizontal line marks the 95% threshold
    and a green dashed line marks the 90% threshold, each with a bold label on the
    left side. A large orange marker highlights the 95% crossing point at component
    10, with a curved arrow annotation reading "10 components explain 96.2%" in a
    boxed label. A subtle green shaded region fills below the 90% line. The legend
    in the lower right identifies "Cumulative Variance" and "Individual Variance".
    Title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Clean whitegrid
    styling with top and right spines removed.
