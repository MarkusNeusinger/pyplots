review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color contrast with colorblind-safe blue/yellow combination
  - LOWESS curve is smooth and clearly distinguishable from scatter points
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle mentioning the smoothing parameter
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for data density
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Custom LOWESS implementation works correctly with tricube weighting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than context-specific
  - Custom function definition in code deviates from KISS principle (though necessary)
  - Data could be tied to a more realistic scenario with meaningful labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with LOWESS regression on a
    white background. Blue circular markers (with transparency and blue outline) represent
    200 data points spread across X values 0-10 and Y values approximately -6 to 25.
    A smooth yellow/gold LOWESS curve runs through the data, showing a non-linear
    pattern: starting around y=1, dipping slightly around x=3.5 (to ~-0.5), then rising
    continuously to about y=21 at x=10. The title "scatter-regression-lowess · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Non-linear Trend with
    LOWESS Smoothing (frac=0.3)". Axis labels show "X Value" and "Y Value". A legend
    in the upper right shows "Data Points" (blue circle) and "LOWESS Curve" (yellow
    line). Subtle grid lines are visible.'

        comment: 'Markers are well-sized (radius 10) with good alpha transparency

          excellent contrast and are colorblind-safe (blue-yellow is the safest combination).

        comment: '"X Value" and "Y Value" are descriptive but lack units or context

        comment: 'Data shows complex non-linear relationship (sine + quadratic) that
          varies across x-axis range. LOWESS effectively captures local trends. Minor:

        comment: Data is mathematically generated showing a plausible complex pattern.
          Generic "X Value"/"Y Value" labels reduce context. Could be more anchored
          to a real-world scenario.

        comment: Code includes a custom `lowess()` function definition. While necessary
          (Highcharts lacks built-in LOWESS), this deviates from the KISS principle
          of no functions/classes.
