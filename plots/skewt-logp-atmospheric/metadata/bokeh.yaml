review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of skewed temperature transformation with 45° angle
  - Proper logarithmic, inverted pressure axis (surface at bottom)
  - 'All reference line types included: isotherms, dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing
    ratio lines'
  - Realistic synthetic atmospheric sounding data with appropriate values
  - Good color differentiation between line types
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper reproducibility seed
  - Proper output in both PNG and interactive HTML formats
  weaknesses:
  - Does not utilize Bokeh HoverTool for interactive display of temperature/pressure
    values at each data point
  - Reference line text labels (Dry Adiabats, Moist Adiabats, Mixing Ratio) are relatively
    faint and could benefit from better contrast or slightly larger size
  - Legend glyph sizing does not fully match the prominent line widths in the plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a
    logarithmic, inverted pressure axis (1000 hPa at bottom to 100 hPa at top) on
    the y-axis and skewed temperature coordinates on the x-axis. The temperature profile
    is shown as a solid red line with circular markers, starting at approximately
    25°C at the surface and decreasing to about -70°C at 100 hPa. The dewpoint profile
    is shown as a dashed teal/green line with diamond markers, always remaining below
    the temperature. Reference lines include: gray isotherms (skewed 45° to the right),
    tan/orange dashed dry adiabats, light blue dot-dashed moist adiabats, and green
    dotted mixing ratio lines. A highlighted blue 0°C isotherm is visible. Labels
    for "Dry Adiabats", "Moist Adiabats", and "Mixing Ratio" appear on the plot. The
    legend in the top-left corner shows Temperature, Dewpoint, and 0°C Isotherm entries.
    The background is a light gray (#f8f9fa).'
