review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot-style composition
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate the density contour concept
  - Good overlay of scatter points for context as suggested in spec notes
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate text sizing
  - Correct title format and colorblind-safe color palette
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (generic Measurement A/B without specifying units)
  - Could utilize filled contours for stronger visual impact as mentioned in spec
  - Contour line thickness could be slightly thicker for better visibility at smaller
    viewing sizes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density contour visualization with three
    distinct clusters visible against a minimal gray background. Blue/gray semi-transparent
    scatter points (alpha ~0.2) show the raw data distribution, while golden-yellow
    contour lines (color #FFD43B) outline regions of equal density. The main cluster
    is centered around (50, 45), a secondary cluster at (75, 70), and a smaller cluster
    at (30, 75). The title "contour-density · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in black text. Axis labels read "Measurement A" (x-axis) and "Measurement
    B" (y-axis). The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines. The
    16:9 aspect ratio is properly utilized with good canvas coverage.'

        comment: Uses geom_density_2d which is the standard approach; could leverage
          additional ggplot grammar features like filled contours with stat_density_2d
          or color-mapped density
