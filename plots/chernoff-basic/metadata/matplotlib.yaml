review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Chernoff faces with clear visual differentiation between
    car categories
  - 'Well-designed feature mapping: face width for efficiency, height for power, eye
    size for reliability, mouth curve for comfort creates intuitive visual patterns'
  - Clean, informative legends that explain both the category colors and feature mappings
  - Good use of square figure format (12x12) for the 3x3 grid layout
  - Category-specific data generation creates meaningful visual clusters (Economy=wide
    faces, Sports=tall faces, Luxury=happy faces)
  - Professional appearance with consistent styling (line widths, alpha values, edge
    colors)
  weaknesses:
  - Some wasted vertical space at the top of the figure above the first row of faces
    could be reduced
  - The within-category variation could be more pronounced to better demonstrate the
    multivariate nature of the visualization
  - Could potentially add more facial features (e.g., ear size, hair) to map additional
    variables as mentioned in the spec
