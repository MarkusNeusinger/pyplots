review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-sized fonts throughout (28pt title, 22pt labels,
    18pt ticks)
  - Clean KISS code structure following the grammar of graphics pattern
  - Realistic employee performance data scenario with appropriate variation across
    groups
  - Proper use of categorical ordering to ensure consistent display
  - Good alpha transparency (0.85) making boxes visually appealing
  - Correct implementation of all spec requirements including outliers
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio with scale=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Performance scores exceeding 100% is slightly unrealistic for a percentage metric
  - Legend title Experience Level in labs() but legend fill parameter just says fill
    - minor label inconsistency
  - Does not leverage lets-plot interactive features in the HTML export (tooltips
    would enhance the visualization)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot with 4 departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Operations) on the x-axis and Performance Score (%) on the y-axis
    ranging from approximately 20 to 110. Within each department, there are 3 side-by-side
    box plots representing experience levels: Junior (blue #306998), Mid-Level (yellow
    #FFD43B), and Senior (green #4CAF50). The boxes show clear median lines, quartile
    boxes, whiskers, and outliers displayed as gray circles. The title reads "box-grouped
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. A legend on the right identifies
    the three experience levels. The plot uses a minimal theme with a light gray background
    and subtle grid lines.'

        comment: Uses lets-plot grammar of graphics appropriately with theme_minimal,
          scale_fill_manual, but doesn't leverage unique lets-plot features like interactive
          tooltips in HTML output
  verdict: APPROVED
