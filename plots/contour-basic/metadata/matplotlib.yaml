review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of combined filled contours (contourf) and line contours for visual
    clarity
  - Smart differentiation between minor (50m) and major (200m) contour intervals with
    different line weights
  - Well-labeled major contour lines with readable format
  - Realistic topographic scenario with multiple terrain features (peaks, valley,
    slope)
  - Proper use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean, well-commented code explaining each terrain feature in the elevation model
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - The white valley area created by low elevation values could be confusing - consider
    adjusting the color scale or level range
  - Some contour labels appear in multiple locations which could be reduced for cleaner
    presentation
