review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic scenario using GPS traffic data near Seattle coordinates
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following library conventions
  - Proper use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Good tooltip configuration for interactivity in HTML output
  - Clear axis labels with appropriate units and formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Uses rectangular bins (mark_rect) instead of hexagonal bins as the spec requires
    - this is the fundamental visualization type mismatch
  - No subtle grid to help readers locate specific coordinates in the density plot
  - Could benefit from showing the underlying data distribution more clearly
