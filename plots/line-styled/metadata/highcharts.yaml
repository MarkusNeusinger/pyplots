review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all 4 required line styles (Solid, Dash, Dot, DashDot)
    using Highcharts native dash_style property
  - Realistic, geographically appropriate temperature data for European cities showing
    clear seasonal patterns
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette that works well with line style differentiation
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Good use of margins and layout for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Thick line widths (6px) and large markers (10px radius) ensure visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols do not clearly show the different dash patterns - they appear as
    similar horizontal lines, making it harder to match legend to plot lines by style
    alone
  - Grid line alpha could be slightly higher (0.2-0.3) for better readability while
    maintaining subtlety
  image_description: "The plot displays a styled line chart showing monthly average\
    \ temperatures for 4 European cities (Madrid, Berlin, Edinburgh, Oslo) over a\
    \ 12-month period. The chart has a white background with the title \"line-styled\
    \ · highcharts · pyplots.ai\" at the top and a subtitle \"Monthly Average Temperature\
    \ by City\". \n\n**Line Styles Visible:**\n- **Madrid** (dark blue): Solid line\
    \ with circular markers, highest temperatures (peak ~35°C in August)\n- **Berlin**\
    \ (yellow/gold): Dashed line with circular markers, moderate temperatures (peak\
    \ ~31°C in July)\n- **Edinburgh** (purple): Dotted line with square markers, cooler\
    \ temperatures (peak ~25°C in July)\n- **Oslo** (cyan/teal): Dash-dot line with\
    \ triangular markers, coldest (peak ~18°C in July, drops to ~-4°C in winter)\n\
    \nThe Y-axis shows \"Temperature (°C)\" ranging from -7 to 37, and the X-axis\
    \ shows months from Jan to Dec. A vertical legend on the right displays all 4\
    \ cities with their corresponding line styles. Grid lines are subtle. All four\
    \ line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot) are clearly distinguishable."

        comment: 'Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1-0.2). Legend is well-placed and uses symbolWidth:
          80 to show line styles clearly. However, the legend line style symbols don''t
          clearly show the different styles (Dash, Dot, DashDot appear similar to
          Solid in the legend).'

        comment: Shows all 4 distinct line styles clearly in the plot area. Slight
          deduction because the styles could be more exaggerated in terms of dash
          lengths for even better differentiation.

        comment: Uses Highcharts' dash_style property for line differentiation. Could
          have used more advanced Highcharts features like tooltips or animations,
          but the core feature (line styling) is well implemented.
  verdict: APPROVED
