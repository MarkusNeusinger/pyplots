review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized bars, clear color coding, and readable
    labels at all sizes
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: correct Gantt chart implementation with all required
    features (task bars, categories, date formatting)'
  - Realistic software development project scenario demonstrates practical Gantt chart
    use
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with x/x2 temporal encoding for date ranges
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips showing task details enhances usability
  - Colorblind-safe palette using distinct hues (blue, yellow, green, red-orange,
    purple)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are functional but could be more descriptive (e.g., Project Timeline
    2024 instead of Timeline)
  - Could demonstrate more Altair-specific features like layered marks or selections
  - Minor whitespace imbalance between chart area and margins
  image_description: 'The plot displays a well-organized Gantt chart for a software
    development project with 12 tasks. Tasks are represented as horizontal bars with
    rounded corners spanning from January 2024 to April 2024. The bars are color-coded
    by five project phases: Planning (Python Blue #306998), Design (Python Yellow
    #FFD43B), Development (Green #4C9A2A), Testing (Red-orange #C73E1D), and Deployment
    (Purple #8B5CF6). Tasks are logically ordered from bottom to top by start date,
    with "Requirements" at the bottom and "Deployment" at the top. The x-axis shows
    dates labeled "Timeline" with date ticks in "%b %d" format at -45° angle. The
    y-axis shows task names labeled "Tasks". A legend titled "Phase" appears on the
    right side with large, clearly visible symbols. The title "gantt-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Grid lines are subtle (dashed, low opacity).
    The chart clearly shows task overlaps and project timeline progression.'
