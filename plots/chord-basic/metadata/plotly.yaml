review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chord diagram implementation from scratch using Plotly low-level primitives
  - Clean visual design with well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette
  - Proper bidirectional flow handling with chord widths proportional to flow values
  - Good use of SVG path shapes for chord ribbons with bezier curves through center
  - Informative hover tooltips on outer arcs showing total flow per continent
  - Well-positioned rotated labels around the perimeter
  - Dual output format (PNG + interactive HTML) leverages Plotly strength
  weaknesses:
  - Some smaller flow chords are difficult to distinguish due to overlapping
  - Interactive hover on individual chords would enhance the HTML version
  image_description: 'The chord diagram displays migration flows between 6 continents
    arranged in a circular layout. The outer ring shows colored arcs for each continent:
    Africa (blue, #306998), Asia (yellow, #FFD43B), Europe (green, #2E8B57), N. America
    (red, #DC143C), S. America (purple, #9370DB), and Oceania (orange, #FF8C00). Continent
    labels are positioned around the perimeter with rotated text for readability.
    Chords connect the continents with widths proportional to migration flow values,
    using semi-transparent fills (opacity 0.6) to show overlapping flows. The title
    "Migration Flows Between Continents · chord-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. A legend on the right identifies each continent. The layout is clean
    with a white background.'
