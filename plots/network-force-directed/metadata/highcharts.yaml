review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts networkgraph module with proper physics simulation
    parameters
  - Colorblind-safe palette distinguishes 4 communities clearly
  - Good data model with realistic social network scenario (32 people, 4 departments)
  - Force-directed layout naturally reveals community structure
  - Proper handling of inline JS for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Network occupies only ~35% of the canvas area, leaving excessive white space on
    all sides
  - Some node label overlaps in dense clusters (Finn/Carol/Quinn area)
  - Uses raw JavaScript literals instead of highcharts-core Python API (works but
    not idiomatic)
