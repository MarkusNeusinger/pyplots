review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh wedge glyph to create authentic polar bars
  - Clean mathematical transformation from compass directions to Bokeh angle system
  - Professional styling with Python blue (#306998) color scheme throughout
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data organization
  - Reference circles and radial lines provide clear visual guides
  - Color intensity mapping to frequency adds extra visual dimension
  weaknesses:
  - Scale labels show percent symbol but data represents raw frequency counts, which
    is semantically inconsistent
  - No legend or annotation explaining what the colors and values represent
  image_description: The plot displays a polar bar chart (wind rose) with 8 compass
    directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) arranged in a circle. The bars are rendered
    as wedges radiating from the center, with the W (West) direction having the longest
    bar extending to approximately 75% of the radius, followed by SW (Southwest).
    The bars use a Blues8 color palette where darker blues indicate higher frequencies.
    Three concentric dashed reference circles are visible at 7%, 14%, and 22% intervals
    with subtle gray labeling. Direction labels are displayed in bold blue (#306998)
    text around the outer perimeter. The title "polar-bar · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in Python blue. The background is a subtle off-white (#fafafa), and
    the overall layout is clean and well-balanced in a square 3600×3600 format.
