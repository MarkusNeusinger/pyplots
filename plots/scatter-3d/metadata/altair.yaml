review:
  strengths:
  - Creative isometric 3D projection technique that works excellently within Altair
    2D constraints
  - Depth-based opacity creates effective sense of 3D depth perception
  - Order encoding implements painter's algorithm for proper point layering
  - Interactive pan/zoom and comprehensive tooltips showing original 3D coordinates
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between clusters
  - Clean, well-documented code structure with clear separation of concerns
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels Projected X and Projected Z are generic; could reference the original
    3D axes more clearly
  - Uses deprecated selection_interval(bind=scales) API; should use chart.interactive()
    for simpler approach
  image_description: "The plot displays a 3D scatter plot projected into 2D using\
    \ an isometric projection. It shows three distinct clusters of points:\n- **Cluster\
    \ 1** (blue, #306998): Located in the upper-right area of the canvas, containing\
    \ approximately 50 points\n- **Cluster 2** (yellow, #FFD43B): Located in the upper-left\
    \ area of the canvas, containing approximately 50 points  \n- **Cluster 3** (orange,\
    \ #E07B39): Located in the lower-center to lower-right area, containing approximately\
    \ 50 points\n\nThe title \"scatter-3d · altair · pyplots.ai\" is clearly displayed\
    \ at the top with a subtitle \"Isometric projection with depth-based opacity\"\
    . The X-axis is labeled \"Projected X\" and the Y-axis is labeled \"Projected\
    \ Z\". Points have varying opacity based on depth, with white stroke borders.\
    \ A legend is positioned in the top-right corner showing all three cluster labels.\
    \ The grid is subtle with dashed lines."
