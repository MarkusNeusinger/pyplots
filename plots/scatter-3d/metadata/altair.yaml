review:
  strengths:
  - Elegant 3D-to-2D projection implementation with mathematically correct azimuth/elevation
    rotation
  - Smart use of depth-based opacity and point ordering (painters algorithm) to convey
    3D structure
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between clusters
  - Tooltips preserve original X, Y, Z values for user reference
  - Pan/zoom interactivity enabled via selection_interval
  - White stroke on points provides clear visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis is lost in the projection (only X and Z are visible); consider adding a
    note or tooltip clarification that Y contributes to depth
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the data clusters rather than isolated in
    the corner
  - Axis labels could be more informative about the projection (e.g., mention that
    this is an isometric-style view)
