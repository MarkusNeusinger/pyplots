review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling through operating range shading and differentiated
    critical speed markers (faded circles vs emphasized diamonds)
  - Comprehensive, well-organized legend that clearly distinguishes all element types
    (modes, EO lines, critical speeds, operating range)
  - Engine order labels positioned along their lines with correct rotation angles,
    using white background boxes for readability
  - Realistic rotordynamic data with proper mode naming and physically plausible frequency
    behavior (gyroscopic effects)
  - Clean visual hierarchy with subtle gridlines, refined spines, and intentional
    color choices
  weaknesses:
  - The 1st Torsional and Axial critical speed annotations in the operating range
    are very close together (~60-63 Hz), risking visual overlap — consider increasing
    vertical offset separation between them
  - 'Layout balance could be improved: the external legend takes ~22% of canvas width,
    compressing the plot area — consider placing the legend below the plot or making
    it more compact'
  - The green (1st Torsional) and orange (2nd Bending) colors could be better distinguished
    for deuteranopia accessibility — consider using a more blue-shifted alternative
    for one of them
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with rotational speed (0-6000
    RPM) on the x-axis and frequency (0-110 Hz) on the y-axis. Five natural frequency
    mode curves are plotted: 1st Bending (blue, rising), 2nd Bending (orange, declining),
    1st Torsional (green, nearly flat at ~62 Hz), Axial (purple, declining), and 3rd
    Bending (brown/dark orange, rising then flattening). Three dashed gray engine
    order lines (1x, 2x, 3x) radiate diagonally from the origin with rotated labels.
    Critical speed intersections outside the operating range are shown as faded pink
    circles, while those inside the operating range (2500-4500 RPM, shaded light blue
    with dotted vertical boundaries) are emphasized with larger red diamond markers.
    Annotations in dark red bordered boxes label the critical modes in the operating
    range: 3rd Bending, 2nd Bending, 1st Torsional, and Axial. A comprehensive legend
    is positioned outside the plot to the right, listing all mode curves, engine order
    lines, critical speed markers (inside and outside), and the operating range. The
    title reads "campbell-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai." The overall layout is
    clean with subtle differentiated gridlines (y-axis more visible than x-axis) and
    removed top/right spines with thinned left/bottom spines.'
