review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GridSpec layout with proper axis alignment between main scatter and
    marginal histograms
  - Clean bimodal data generation showing correlation structure
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) reveals density patterns without obscuring
    points
  - Consistent styling throughout (colors, edge colors, spine visibility)
  - Subtle grid styling that aids readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Generic axis labels (X Value, Y Value) rather than domain-specific labels with
    units
  - Could overlay KDE curves on histograms as spec suggests this is an option
  - Marker size (s=120) slightly larger than optimal for 200 points per guidelines
    (should be ~50-100)
