review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-chosen font sizes (18pt labels, 22pt titles,
    28pt main title)
  - Clean declarative Altair code that follows the library grammar of graphics philosophy
  - Realistic and relatable data scenario (programming language popularity)
  - Proper sorting by value for easy comparison (largest to smallest)
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low opacity
  - Includes interactive tooltips with formatted values
  - Correct title format and overall professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be even more subtle or add value labels at bar ends for full
    points
  - All bars use same color - spec suggests highlighting specific bars could draw
    attention
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific interactivity features like selection/highlighting
    in HTML version
