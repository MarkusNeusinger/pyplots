review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with regression equation annotation, R-squared display,
    outlier highlighting, and quartile plot bands
  - Publication-quality typography and color scheme with intentional hierarchy (title,
    subtitle, axis, tick labels)
  - 'Strong use of Highcharts-distinctive features: rich HTML tooltips, annotations
    module, plot bands, marker hover states, shadow tooltips'
  - Dual output (static PNG + interactive HTML) showcasing Highcharts interactive
    capability
  - Realistic health/biometric dataset with plausible values and meaningful statistical
    overlay
  weaknesses:
  - 'Margins are generous (especially marginBottom: 310) leading to slightly suboptimal
    canvas utilization'
  - Some chart options are set as raw dicts rather than using Highcharts-Core typed
    objects consistently
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart of Height (cm) vs Weight (kg)
    on a light gray (#fafbfc) background. Blue circular markers with white outlines
    represent 100 "Subjects" data points, while orange diamond markers highlight statistical
    outliers. An orange dashed trend line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right,
    showing the positive correlation. The title reads "scatter-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" in dark text with a subtitle "Height vs Weight — positive correlation
    across 100 subjects" in gray. A floating legend in the upper-right lists three
    series: Subjects (blue circle), Outliers (orange diamond), and Trend (R² = 0.55).
    An annotation box near the lower-left displays the regression equation "y = 0.58x
    -27.8 | R² = 0.55" with an orange border. Subtle light-blue horizontal plot bands
    mark the "Lower quartile" and "Upper quartile" regions with labeled text. Both
    axes have dotted grid lines, labeled ticks at 5-unit intervals, and descriptive
    titles with units.'
