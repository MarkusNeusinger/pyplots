review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of letter-value plot with clear nested box structure
  - Realistic server response time scenario with appropriate data characteristics
    (skewed distributions, tail behavior)
  - Good color gradient from dark blue to light lavender that clearly shows quantile
    depth
  - Yellow median lines provide excellent contrast and visibility
  - Legend clearly explains the quantile ranges
  - Proper handling of outliers as distinct red points
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a helper function compute_letter_values() which violates the KISS principle
    (imports → data → plot → save, no functions)
  - Legend order shows 50% at top and 99.6% at bottom, which is counterintuitive to
    visual interpretation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a letter-value (boxen) plot comparing response
    times across four server endpoints: API Gateway, Auth Service, Database, and Cache
    Layer. Each endpoint shows nested rectangular boxes representing quantile ranges
    from 50% (innermost, dark blue #306998) to 99.6% (outermost, light lavender).
    The boxes decrease in width for deeper quantiles, creating the characteristic
    boxen plot shape. Yellow/gold median lines are prominently displayed across each
    distribution. Red dots mark outliers beyond the 99.6% quantile. The Database endpoint
    shows the widest distribution and most outliers, while Cache Layer shows the tightest
    distribution with lowest response times. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle
    grid lines and a clean legend on the right explaining the quantile ranges.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar with geom_rect, geom_segment, geom_point. Manual
          construction necessary as lets-plot has no native boxen geom.
