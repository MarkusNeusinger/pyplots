review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme (blue-white-red) with proper midpoint at 0
  - Clear cell annotations with bold text for easy reading
  - Realistic financial metrics dataset with meaningful correlations
  - Proper use of coord_fixed() for square tiles
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML output
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No upper/lower triangle masking (spec mentions this as optional but would enhance)
  - Axis labels are generic "Financial Metric" rather than more descriptive
  - Legend could be slightly more prominent
