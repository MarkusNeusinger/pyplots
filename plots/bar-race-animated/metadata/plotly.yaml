review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly animation_frame for smooth bar race animation
  - Clean, readable layout with properly sized fonts and margins
  - Interactive controls (play/pause, timeline slider) with year indicator
  - Consistent color mapping per platform across frames
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  - Realistic streaming platform scenario with varied growth trajectories
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle/nearly invisible - could use slightly more visible
    grid (alpha 0.2-0.3)
  - Static PNG only shows 2019 frame; users seeing PNG miss the animation story
  - Two similar blue shades (StreamFlix and OnDemandTV) could be more distinct
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing 10 streaming
    platform subscriber counts for the year 2019. StreamFlix leads with 146M subscribers
    (dark blue bar), followed by ViewMax at 109M (yellow), WatchHub at 85M (red/orange),
    PlayStream at 59M (blue), CinemaCloud at 50M (purple), MediaFlow at 41M (gray),
    ScreenTime at 34M (orange), FlixNow at 23M (green), StreamZone at 20M (pink),
    and OnDemandTV at 15M (light blue). The title "bar-race-animated · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Subscribers (Millions)" ranging from
    0 to 450. A year indicator shows "Year: 2019" and a timeline slider at the bottom
    spans 2019-2024 with play/pause controls. Each bar has its value labeled to the
    right. The bars are sorted in descending order by subscriber count. Colors are
    distinct and consistent per platform. The layout has ample margins and uses a
    clean white background with subtle grid lines.'
