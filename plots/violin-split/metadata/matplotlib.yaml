review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of split violin using matplotlib's violinplot with clever
    path clipping technique
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good color choice (Python blue/yellow) with high contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Quartile markers on both sides enhance interpretability
  - Realistic salary data with varying distribution shapes across departments
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning in upper right could potentially overlap with tall violins
    in some edge cases
  - Quartile line colors (white on blue, black on yellow) work but could be more consistent
  - Could utilize matplotlib's built-in statistical annotations more
