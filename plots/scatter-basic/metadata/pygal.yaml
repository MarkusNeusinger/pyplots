  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format, axis labels with units, and
    appropriate chart type
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed and no over-engineering
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) with appropriate
    value ranges
  - Explicit font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas ensures readability
  - Good use of pygal dual output capability (PNG + HTML)
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling elements: a trend line, correlation annotation, or callout
    highlighting the positive relationship would elevate the design significantly'
  - 'Visual refinement is minimal: the dashed grid lines and default pygal chrome
    could be improved with subtler grid styling or customized axis appearance'
  - Dot size could be better tuned for the data density of 120 points — slightly smaller
    dots would reduce visual clustering
  - Canvas utilization has room for improvement — the plot area could fill more of
    the available space
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart of 120 blue data points on
    a white background with subtle dashed gray grid lines on both axes. The title
    "scatter-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in gray sans-serif text.
    The X-axis is labeled "Study Hours per Week (hrs)" ranging from approximately
    2 to 13, and the Y-axis is labeled "Exam Score (%)" ranging from about 30% to
    97%. The data points show a clear positive linear correlation — students who study
    more hours tend to score higher on exams, with visible scatter/noise around the
    trend. The points are rendered in Python Blue (#306998) with moderate transparency.
    No legend is displayed (single series). The overall layout is clean and professional,
    with the plot area occupying a reasonable portion of the canvas.
