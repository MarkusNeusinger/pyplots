review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Manhattan plot with proper GWAS conventions (alternating
    chromosome colors, cumulative positions, threshold lines)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with significant SNPs highlighted as distinct red diamonds
    above the main point cloud
  - Comprehensive hover information showing chromosome, position, and -log10(p) value
    with proper formatting
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Proper threshold line annotations positioned to avoid data overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like chromosome filtering
    dropdown or range slider for genomic position
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (currently very faint at alpha 0.1)
