review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart technique with proper band folding and
    color intensity mapping
  - Uses colorblind-friendly blue/orange palette that clearly distinguishes positive
    from negative values
  - 'Good use of Bokeh features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with custom tooltips
    showing original values, varea for smooth bands'
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with 6 distinct servers and 200 time points
    each
  - Well-structured color legend explaining the band meanings
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with stacked subplots filling the space effectively
  weaknesses:
  - The color legend at the very top, while present, could be more visually prominent
    and integrated
  - The axis label Hour of Day could include units (e.g., Hour of Day 0-24h)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 6 stacked horizon charts representing server
    CPU metrics over a 24-hour period. Each horizontal band represents a different
    server (Web Server 1, Web Server 2, Database, Cache Server, API Gateway, Load
    Balancer). The visualization uses blue color gradients (light to dark: #a6cee3,
    #306998, #08306b) for positive values and orange/red gradients (light to dark:
    #fdd0a2, #f16913, #8c2d04) for negative values. The band-folding technique is
    correctly implemented, with color intensity increasing as magnitude increases
    within each band. A color legend appears at the top explaining the band meanings.
    The title "horizon-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center.
    The x-axis shows "Hour of Day" from 0 to 24, and each series has its name labeled
    on the left side. The data shows realistic server load patterns with periodic
    oscillations, noise, and occasional spikes.'
