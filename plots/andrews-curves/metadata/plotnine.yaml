review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation
  - Uses StandardScaler for proper variable normalization as recommended in spec
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.4) to reveal density patterns
  - Clean plotnine grammar of graphics implementation with theme_minimal
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Classic Iris dataset provides meaningful, real-world example
  weaknesses:
  - 'Color palette has two similar blue shades (#306998 and #4B8BBE) making setosa
    and virginica difficult to distinguish - use more distinct colors'
  - Contains a function definition (andrews_transform) which violates KISS principle
    - inline the transformation logic
