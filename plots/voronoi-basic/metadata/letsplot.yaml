review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Voronoi tessellation with proper Sutherland-Hodgman
    polygon clipping algorithm
  - Clean visual appearance with well-differentiated colors and clearly visible seed
    points
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labeling
  - Proper use of ggplot grammar with geom_polygon for Voronoi cells and layered points
    for seeds
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactive viewing
  - Realistic clustered data representing facility locations
  weaknesses:
  - Star import from lets_plot (noqa comment used to suppress linting)
  - Seed points could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  image_description: The plot shows a Voronoi diagram with 20 seed points partitioning
    a 100×100 coordinate space. The diagram features colorful polygon cells in a diverse
    palette including dark blue, teal, yellow, orange, pink, light blue, green, and
    purple tones. Each cell is filled with a distinct semi-transparent color (alpha
    ~0.7) with white edges separating the regions. Seed points are clearly marked
    as black circles with white centers, positioned within their respective Voronoi
    cells. The plot has a correct title format "voronoi-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. Axis labels show "X Coordinate" and "Y Coordinate" with tick marks
    from 0 to 100 in increments of 5. The data shows two clusters - one centered around
    (25, 40) and another around (75, 60) - representing the clustered facility locations
    as described in the code. All cells are properly clipped to the bounding box.
    The layout is clean with a minimal theme.
