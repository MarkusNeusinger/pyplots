review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, color gradient,
    error bars, and value annotations'
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Professional styling with hidden top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate feature names and importance
    values
  - Good use of Blues colormap for sequential color gradient mapped to importance
    values
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Importance Score (normalized)" or similar)
  - Could leverage matplotlib annotate() for more styled value labels with arrows
    or backgrounds
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing feature importances
    from a machine learning model (credit/loan prediction context). The chart shows
    12 features sorted by importance from bottom to top, with "Income" being the most
    important (0.182) and "Number of Dependents" the least important (0.015). The
    bars use a sequential blue color gradient (Blues colormap) that transitions from
    lighter blue for lower values to darker blue for higher importance values. Each
    bar has error bars showing standard deviation and value annotations displayed
    to the right of each bar. The title uses the correct format "bar-feature-importance
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The x-axis is labeled "Importance Score" and y-axis
    is labeled "Feature". A subtle dashed grid is visible on the x-axis only. The
    top and right spines are hidden for a cleaner appearance.

        comment: Uses barh with error bars, colormap, spine customization. Good but
          could use additional matplotlib features like annotate() for richer annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
