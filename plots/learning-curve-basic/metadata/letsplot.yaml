quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen blue/yellow color scheme that provides
    high contrast
  - Perfect implementation of learning curve concept showing classic overfitting pattern
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar usage with geom_ribbon for confidence bands
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units/scale indicator (e.g., Accuracy Score 0-1)
  - Could demonstrate more lets-plot specific features like tooltips or interactive
    elements
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a learning curve with two distinct lines on a light gray background. The title "learning-curve-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis displays "Training Set Size (samples)" ranging from 0 to 1,600, and the y-axis shows "Accuracy Score" ranging from 0.55 to 1.0. Two curves are visible:
    - A **blue line** (Training Score) starting around 0.88 and quickly rising to plateau near 0.99
    - A **yellow/gold line** (Validation Score) starting around 0.67 and gradually rising to about 0.84
    Both curves have shaded confidence bands showing standard deviation. The legend is positioned at the bottom center, clearly labeling "Training Score" and "Validation Score". The plot demonstrates a classic overfitting pattern with a gap between training and validation scores.
