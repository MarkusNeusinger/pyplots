review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly pull parameter to achieve exploded effect with per-slice
    control
  - Clean professional color palette with Python colors and colorblind-safe choices
  - Well-formatted title following the required spec-id format
  - Interactive hover template provides additional value on HTML output
  - Outside labels with connectors keep the pie chart clean and readable
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Plotly interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has unused whitespace at bottom of square canvas; pie could be vertically
    centered better
  - Market share values could show more dramatic contrast to better demonstrate the
    exploded emphasis effect
