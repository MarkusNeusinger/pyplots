review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with clean, readable code
  - Well-implemented tooltips with formatted values showing interactivity capability
  - Total value labels above each stack as recommended by the spec
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue (#306998)
  - Proper sizing with ggsize(1600, 900) and scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean theme with styled legend background and appropriate font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Data could show more variation in component proportions across quarters to better
    demonstrate part-to-whole analysis
  - Legend stacking order visually shows bottom-to-top but legend reads top-to-bottom
    (minor visual disconnect)
