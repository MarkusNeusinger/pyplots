review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions (different medians, spreads,
    and outliers) that demonstrate all boxplot features
  - Clean visual hierarchy with Python Blue boxes and contrasting Yellow strip points
  - Proper use of modern seaborn API (hue parameter with palette, legend=False)
  - Smart handling of outliers by hiding boxplot fliers (fliersize=0) since strip
    plot shows all points
  - Good jitter (0.2) and alpha (0.7) settings for strip points to show density without
    excessive overlap
  - Realistic manufacturing quality scenario with appropriate value ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could include both x and y axes for complete reference (minor)
