review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic organizational chart data with clear hierarchy
  - Good color differentiation between levels using Python-themed palette
  - Clean code structure with well-commented sections
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern
  - HoverTool adds interactivity showing role and level
  - Appropriate hiding of axes for network visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Node sizes appear small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas; level 3 nodes especially
    could be larger
  - Level legend positioned far left creates visual imbalance; could be integrated
    as a proper color legend
  - Text labels (24pt) are readable but could benefit from being larger (28-32pt)
    for this resolution
  - Does not use Bokeh native graph/network rendering capabilities (from_networkx
    or GraphRenderer)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical network graph representing
    a software project team organizational chart with 24 employees across 4 levels.
    At the top sits the CEO (large blue node, #306998). Level 1 shows 3 VPs (yellow
    nodes, #FFD43B): VP Engineering, VP Product, and VP Operations. Level 2 contains
    6 Directors/Managers (light blue nodes, #4B8BBE): Frontend Dir., Backend Dir.,
    PM Lead, UX Lead, IT Manager, and HR Manager. Level 3 has 14 Team Members (green
    nodes, #8BC34A) spread across the bottom. Gray edges (#666666) connect parent
    nodes to their direct reports. Node labels appear above each node. Level annotations
    ("Level 0: CEO", "Level 1: VPs", etc.) are positioned on the left side in matching
    colors. The title "network-hierarchical · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top. The layout is top-to-bottom with clear vertical separation between levels.'
