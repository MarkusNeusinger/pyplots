review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of different marker shapes (circle, square, triangle) for series
    differentiation
  - Clean implementation of monthly temperature data with realistic seasonal patterns
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible (blue, yellow, red)
  - Properly sized text for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text and glyph sizes could be slightly larger for better visibility at
    full canvas size
