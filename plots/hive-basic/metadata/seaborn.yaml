review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept with clear 3-axis radial layout
    at 120-degree separation
  - Bezier curve edges provide smooth, visually appealing connections between nodes
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good contrast between blue, yellow, and teal
  - Realistic software dependency network context directly matching specification
    example
  - Node positioning along axes encodes meaningful degree information as specified
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn usage is minimal - only sns.scatterplot for nodes while edges and axes
    use raw matplotlib
  - Edge transparency (alpha=0.4) could be reduced further for dense connections to
    improve bundling effect
  - Title format includes Software Dependencies prefix rather than just the spec-id
    format
