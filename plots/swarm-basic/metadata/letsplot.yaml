quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_sina which is lets-plot native swarm/beeswarm geometry
  - Thoughtful data generation with different distribution shapes (normal, wide spread,
    bimodal, outliers) showcasing swarm plot capabilities
  - Clean mean markers using geom_crossbar that do not obscure individual points
  - Appropriate point sizing and alpha for the data density (~175 points)
  - 'Proper use of lets-plot idioms: ggsize for dimensions, scale=3 for high-resolution
    output'
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Performance Score could include units or scale indication like Performance
    Score (0-100)
