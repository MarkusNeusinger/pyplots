review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard layout using facet_wrap with free_y scales
  - Smart color logic for change indicators (favorable vs unfavorable based on metric
    type)
  - Clean tile appearance with hidden axes and grid
  - Good layering of area fill, line, and endpoint markers
  - Proper lets-plot exports (PNG with scale and HTML for interactivity)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more prominent visual distinction for the warning status tile (Memory)
    beyond just orange fill
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3x2 grid of 6 dashboard metric tiles arranged in a faceted layout. Each tile contains:
    - A metric name header at the top in gray text (Active Users, CPU Usage, Error Rate, Memory, Response Time, Throughput)
    - A large prominent value displayed in the center in bold dark text (1,284 / 45% / 0.8% / 72% / 120ms / 847req/s)
    - A mini sparkline visualization showing trend history with a green filled area chart and line (orange fill for the warning-status Memory tile)
    - An endpoint marker (green dot) at the end of each sparkline
    - A change indicator with up/down arrow and percentage below the sparkline (▲/▼ with values like 12.5%, 5.2%, 22.0%, 8.3%, 15.1%, 3.7%)
    - The change indicator colors correctly differentiate favorable changes (green) from unfavorable changes (red/orange) based on metric context

    The overall layout has a very light gray background (#F9FAFB) with white tile panels surrounded by subtle gray borders. The title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in large bold text. The tiles are well-spaced with consistent sizing, creating a clean professional dashboard appearance. Axes, ticks, and grids are intentionally hidden to achieve the tile aesthetic.
