review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation
  - Proper use of theme_minimal() with customized text sizes for readability
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scale export for high-resolution output
  - Exports both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  - Good transparency (alpha=0.7) for revealing overlapping points
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that do not overwhelm the data
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels use generic X Value/Y Value instead of a realistic scenario (e.g.,
    Study Hours vs Exam Score)
  - Title text could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D scatter chart with approximately 150 data
    points in a muted blue color (#306998) with transparency (alpha 0.7). The title
    "scatter-basic · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left in gray text.
    The X-axis is labeled "X Value" ranging from approximately 4.5 to 15, and the
    Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" ranging from approximately 1 to 18. The points show
    a clear positive linear correlation with moderate scatter/noise around the trend.
    A subtle dashed gray grid provides reference lines. The plot uses a 16:9 aspect
    ratio with a clean minimal theme and white background.
