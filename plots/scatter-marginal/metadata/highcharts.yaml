review:
  strengths:
  - Creative multi-chart solution using CSS grid to compose three Highcharts charts
    into a unified visualization
  - Proper handling of Highcharts in headless Chrome with inline JS embedding
  - Consistent color scheme and styling across all three charts
  - Good use of transparency on scatter points revealing density patterns
  - Correct title format and placement
  - Clean separation of histogram calculations using numpy
  weaknesses:
  - Marginal histogram axes do not perfectly align with scatter plot axes (they use
    categorical indices vs. continuous values)
  - The gap between the charts is visible, breaking the seamless marginal distribution
    effect
  - Y-axis marginal uses BarSeries import but instantiates with ColumnSeries class
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than a realistic scenario
  - Font sizes could be scaled up slightly for the large canvas dimensions
