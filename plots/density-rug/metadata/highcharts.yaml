review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal distribution data that demonstrates KDE ability to reveal distribution
    shape
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color combination (blue/yellow)
  - Clean separation of KDE curve and rug marks using negative y-position technique
  - Well-structured code following Highcharts best practices
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks use diamond markers instead of tick/line marks as typically expected
    for rug plots
  - Y-axis extends into negative values to accommodate rug marks, which shows internal
    implementation detail
  image_description: The plot displays a density plot with rug marks showing API Response
    Time Distribution. The chart has a light blue filled KDE curve showing a clear
    bimodal distribution with a primary peak around 120ms and a secondary smaller
    peak around 280ms. Below the x-axis (at a slight negative y position) are yellow/gold
    diamond-shaped rug markers representing individual data points. The title "density-rug
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "API Response
    Time Distribution (ms)". The x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from about
    50 to 350+, and the y-axis shows "Density" with values from about -0.00125 to
    0.00925. A legend in the top-right shows "Density (KDE)" and "Rug (Individual
    Points)". The layout uses a white background with subtle gray gridlines.
