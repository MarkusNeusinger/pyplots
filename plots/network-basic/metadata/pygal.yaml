review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout algorithm implementation showing clear community
    structure
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent theming with pyplots brand colors
  - Interactive tooltips include node degree information for SVG/HTML output
  - Clean separation of communities with visible cross-community bridge connections
  - Appropriate node sizing and edge visibility for the network density
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title has incorrect format: should be "network-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" without
    extra prefix'
  - Legend shows "Group A/B/C/D" instead of "Community A/B/C/D" as defined in code
  - Network layout is positioned slightly left-heavy, not centered on canvas
