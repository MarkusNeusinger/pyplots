review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with appropriate font sizes for title (24pt), axis labels
    (20pt), and tick labels (16pt)
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation using proper aes mappings and geoms
  - Good color palette with Python blue (#306998) featured prominently
  - Appropriate use of categorical ordering for consistent legend/color mapping
  - Month labels displayed as readable abbreviations (Jan, Feb, etc.) instead of numbers
  - Realistic business data scenario with 4 distinct product trend patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are nearly invisible due to minimal theme - could benefit from explicit
    grid alpha setting
  - Data patterns could show more dramatic trend differences (e.g., line crossovers,
    seasonal spikes) to better demonstrate multi-line comparison capabilities
