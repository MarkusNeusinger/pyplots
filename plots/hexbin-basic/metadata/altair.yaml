review:
  strengths:
  - Creative hexbin solution using custom SVG hexagon path with mark_point — clever
    workaround for Altair lacking built-in hexbin
  - Realistic GPS data context with Seattle coordinates and multi-cluster traffic
    density pattern
  - Full spec compliance with all required features including colorbar, viridis, symlog
    scale
  - Clean code structure with proper seed, explicit font sizes, and thoughtful axis
    configuration
  - Good design foundation with custom background, subtle grid, configured axis colors,
    and white hex strokes
  weaknesses:
  - Hexagon tiling has slight overlap/layering artifacts at edges due to mark_point
    sizing approach
  - X-axis tick label formatting creates near-duplicate values with .2f format
  - Design polish not yet at publication level — needs stronger visual identity and
    subtitle
  - Library mastery constrained by heavy reliance on imperative numpy/pandas code
    for hex computation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization of GPS-like
    traffic density data in the Seattle metropolitan area. Hexagons are colored using
    the viridis colormap, ranging from dark purple (low vehicle count ~5-10) to bright
    yellow (high count ~100+). Two primary density hotspots are visible: a downtown
    core cluster around longitude -122.34 to -122.35 / latitude 47.60-47.61, and a
    shopping district cluster near longitude -122.31 / latitude 47.62. A sparser industrial
    zone cluster appears in the upper-left around longitude -122.35 / latitude 47.63.
    The x-axis is labeled "Longitude (°W)" and the y-axis "Latitude (°N)". A color
    legend titled "Vehicle Count" sits in the top-right corner showing the symlog
    scale from approximately 5 to 100+. The background is a subtle off-white (#f9f9fb)
    with white hexagon stroke edges providing definition between adjacent bins. The
    title reads "hexbin-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" centered at the top in dark gray
    text.'
