review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, multi_line, patches,
    LabelSet)
  - Clear hierarchical organization with group headers and indented tasks
  - Dependency arrows route intelligently around task bars
  - Good color scheme with distinct, colorblind-friendly colors
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas with appropriately scaled fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Missing dependency line type legend (spec mentions including legend for dependency
    styles)
  - Title uses regular hyphen/dot instead of middle-dot separator
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart with task dependencies for a
    software development project. The chart shows 4 phases (Requirements, Design,
    Development, Testing) color-coded with distinct colors: blue (#306998) for Requirements,
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Design, green (#4CAF50) for Development, and pink (#E91E63)
    for Testing. Each phase has a lighter aggregate bar showing the span, with individual
    task bars below in darker shades. Tasks are organized hierarchically with group
    headers and indented task names on the left. Dependency arrows (gray lines with
    arrowheads) connect predecessor task ends to successor task starts, routing around
    bars to avoid overlap. The x-axis shows a timeline from Jan 01 2026 to Mar 01
    with "Timeline" label. A legend in the top-right corner identifies each phase
    color. The title reads "gantt-dependencies · bokeh · pyplots.ai".'
