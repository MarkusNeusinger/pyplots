review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the pyramid chart using the negative-value technique
    for left-extending bars
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper categorical ordering
  - 'Appropriate color contrast (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B) for gender differentiation'
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper theming for high-resolution
    output
  - Realistic population data that demonstrates demographic patterns (larger elderly
    female population)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order (Female, Male) does not match visual order (Male on left, Female
    on right) - consider reordering
