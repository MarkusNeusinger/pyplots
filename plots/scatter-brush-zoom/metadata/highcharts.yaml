review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of brush selection and zoom via zoomType: xy'
  - Well-configured pan functionality with shift key modifier
  - Customized reset zoom button with proper styling
  - Good use of point selection states (hover and select)
  - Clear instructional subtitle explaining interaction
  - Colorblind-safe palette
  - Proper handling of headless Chrome rendering with inline Highcharts JS
  - Creates both interactive HTML and static PNG outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Process Parameter X (%) would be better)
  - Title font size could be slightly larger for better prominence
  - Tick label font sizes appear slightly small in the PNG
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with 4 distinct clusters labeled
    Batch A (dark blue, lower-left), Batch B (yellow, upper-right), Batch C (purple,
    center), and Batch D (cyan, upper-left). The title "scatter-brush-zoom · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top with a subtitle providing interaction
    instructions ("Click and drag to select/zoom a region • Shift+drag to pan • Click
    'Reset zoom' to clear"). X-axis is labeled "Process Parameter X" (0-100) and Y-axis
    is labeled "Process Parameter Y" (0-100). A vertical legend on the right shows
    all four batches. The markers are circular with appropriate sizing, and the grid
    uses subtle dashed lines. The overall layout is clean and professional.
