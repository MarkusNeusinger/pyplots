review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chord diagram implementation from scratch using Plotly low-level primitives
  - Clean visual design with well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette
  - Proper bidirectional flow handling with chord widths proportional to flow values
  - Good use of SVG path shapes for chord ribbons with bezier curves through center
  - Informative hover tooltips on outer arcs showing total flow per continent
  - Well-positioned rotated labels around the perimeter
  - Dual output format (PNG + interactive HTML) leverages Plotly strength
  weaknesses:
  - Some smaller flow chords are difficult to distinguish due to overlapping
  - Interactive hover on individual chords would enhance the HTML version
