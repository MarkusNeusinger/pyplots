review:
  strengths:
  - Proper use of pygal.XY chart type for calibration curve with correct data structure
  - 'Good color scheme using pyplots brand colors (#306998, #FFD43B)'
  - Includes Brier scores in legend labels providing quantitative calibration metric
  - Diagonal reference line correctly implemented with dashed style
  - Custom Style properly configured for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriate font sizes
  - X and Y axis formatting with sensible ranges (0-1) for probability data
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (compute_calibration, brier_score) violating KISS principle
    - should be inline calculations
  - Legend positioned in top-left corner outside plot area looks awkward; would benefit
    from legend_box=True or repositioning
  - The overconfident model miscalibration pattern is subtle and could be more visually
    distinct
  - Uses strict=True parameter which is Python 3.10+ specific
  - Dual output (plot.png and plot.html) when only plot.png is expected
  - Perfect calibration line should have more distinctive styling to stand out from
    model curves
