review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear color zones following intuitive red/yellow/green
    convention
  - Creative use of Altair mark_arc for gauge segments and mark_rule for the needle
    indicator
  - Prominent value display (72%) centered below the gauge for immediate readability
  - Proper use of Altair layering system to combine arcs, needle, hub, and labels
  - Well-positioned threshold labels (30, 70) and range labels (0, 100)
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a function definition value_to_angle() which violates the KISS structure
    requirement (imports → data → plot → save, no functions)
