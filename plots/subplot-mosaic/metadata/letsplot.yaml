review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of ggbunch() for complex mosaic layouts with precise region
    control
  - Consistent visual theme with harmonious blue/yellow color palette across all 6
    panels
  - Diverse plot types (area, bar, scatter, histogram, line, heatmap) showcase versatility
  - Clear visual hierarchy with appropriately sized panels matching their data importance
  - Realistic business dashboard context with coherent related metrics
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Main title appears at top-left corner rather than centered prominently over entire
    figure
  - Does not demonstrate empty cell capability (using "." placeholder) mentioned in
    spec notes
