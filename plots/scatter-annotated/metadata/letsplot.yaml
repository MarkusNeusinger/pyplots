quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable visualization with all 15 company labels clearly visible
  - Good use of geom_text with nudge_y for label positioning
  - Appropriate point size and alpha for data density
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful outliers (startup high-growth, mature
    low-growth)
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Some label pairs are close together (ByteWorks/SmartScale, DataSys/LogiCore/CloudNet
    region) - could benefit from adjustText-like positioning if available in lets-plot
