review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot syntax
  - Proper use of draw_quantiles parameter to show 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
    inside violins
  - Good visual differentiation between groups with alternating colors
  - Correct title format and proper figure sizing for the required resolution
  - Clean, minimal theme that emphasizes the data
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Generic Group A/B/C/D labels instead of a realistic scenario (e.g., job titles,
    schools)
  - All distributions are normal - adding one skewed or bimodal distribution would
    better demonstrate violin plot capabilities
  - Axis labels lack context or units (e.g., Test Score instead of Value)
