review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of band plot with widening confidence interval demonstrating
    real-world forecasting behavior
  - Clean visual design with appropriate alpha values (0.3 for band, 0.7 for boundary
    lines)
  - Proper use of matplotlib fill_between for the band with clear central trend line
  - Good code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Value is generic and lacks units - could be more descriptive like
    Measurement (units)
  - Data scenario is plausible but generic - could use a more concrete real-world
    context (e.g., stock price forecast, temperature prediction)
