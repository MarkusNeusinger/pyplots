review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts-specific bubbleLegend for size reference — a feature
    unique to this library
  - Professional color scheme with per-sector border colors and intentional alpha
    transparency
  - 'Strong data storytelling: the revenue-vs-growth inverse relationship is immediately
    apparent'
  - Comprehensive tooltip configuration with HTML formatting and series color interpolation
  - All font sizes explicitly set for the 4800x2700 canvas — nothing relies on defaults
  weaknesses:
  - Bubble legend labels in the top-right corner (3480B, 1740B, 0B) are relatively
    small compared to other text elements
  - Upper-left cluster of small bubbles is slightly crowded — a small offset or jitter
    could improve readability
  - The extra plot.html file write (line 199-200) is unnecessary for the spec requirements
  image_description: 'The plot shows a bubble chart with 5 tech sector categories
    (Cloud & SaaS in blue, E-Commerce in orange-brown, Semiconductors in green, Social
    & Media in purple, Fintech in gold-yellow) on a light gray (#fafafa) background.
    The X-axis shows "Revenue (Billion USD)" ranging from 0 to 600, and the Y-axis
    shows "Growth Rate (%)" from 0 to 60. Bubble sizes represent Market Capitalization,
    as explained by both the subtitle and a bubble size legend in the top-right corner
    showing scale from 0B to 3480B. The data reveals a clear inverse relationship:
    smaller, high-growth companies cluster in the upper-left while larger, slower-growth
    companies spread to the lower-right. All bubbles have semi-transparent fills (~0.65
    alpha) with distinct border colors per sector. Dotted grid lines provide subtle
    reference. The title reads "bubble-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a descriptive
    subtitle below. A category legend identifies all 5 sectors.'

          Sector grouping creates natural clusters. Subtitle contextualizes bubble
          size.
