review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar with proper layering (geom_area + geom_line)
  - Realistic website traffic data with weekly cyclical pattern and upward trend
  - Semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.4) as recommended in spec for readability
  - Clean, minimal theme with subtle grid lines
  - Proper title format and legible text sizes throughout
  - Good use of scale_x_datetime for proper date formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Daily Visitors (count)" or "Date (2024)")
  - Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like stat_smooth for trend visualization
