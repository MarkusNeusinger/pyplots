review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Data intentionally shows slight skewness to demonstrate Q-Q plot interpretation
    capabilities
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Highcharts interactivity
  - Reference line properly implemented as dashed yellow line behind scatter points
  - Proper use of Highcharts-core Python library with correct container specification
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function norm_ppf() which violates the KISS principle - should
    be inline or use scipy.stats.norm.ppf
  - X-axis label Theoretical Quantiles appears partially cut off at the bottom of
    the chart
  - Legend could be more descriptive (e.g. N=100 observations instead of generic Sample
    Data)
