review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes and line widths for high-resolution
    output
  - Proper lift curve calculation methodology with clear documentation in comments
  - Good use of decile markers with lift value annotations to highlight key insights
  - Reference baseline at y=1 clearly distinguishes model performance from random
    selection
  - Realistic marketing campaign scenario with appropriate 10% base response rate
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is used minimally - only for sns.lineplot and theming; the core visualization
    could be done entirely in matplotlib
  - First decile annotation appears slightly cramped near the top of the curve
  - Y-axis label could clarify that lift is a ratio
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve chart with a 16:9 landscape format
    on a white background with a subtle gray grid. The main lift curve is rendered
    as a thick blue line (#306998 Python Blue) starting at approximately 10x lift
    on the left and smoothly decreasing to approach 1x at 100% population. A dashed
    yellow/gold horizontal reference line at y=1 represents random selection (no lift).
    Six decile markers are shown as blue circles at the 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%
    population points, with bold blue annotations showing lift values (8.30x, 4.95x,
    3.33x, 2.50x, 2.00x). The title "lift-curve · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently
    displayed at the top in bold. X-axis shows "Population Targeted (%)" from 0-100,
    Y-axis shows "Cumulative Lift" from 0-11. A legend in the upper right identifies
    "Model Lift" (solid blue) and "Random (No Lift)" (dashed yellow).

        passed: false
        comment: Only uses sns.lineplot and sns.set_theme; the actual lift curve calculation
          and most visualization is done with matplotlib (ax.axhline, ax.plot, ax.annotate).
          Seaborn is primarily used for theming rather than its distinctive statistical
          visualization features.
  verdict: APPROVED
