review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE from scratch using Gaussian kernel with Scott's
    rule bandwidth
  - Realistic financial data scenario with fat-tail events demonstrating the KDE's
    smoothing advantage
  - Proper density normalization so histogram and KDE are on comparable scales
  - Good use of semi-transparent histogram bars (alpha=0.5) allowing KDE visibility
    as specified
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML output for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is too small and positioned far from the main data area
  - Missing Bokeh-specific interactive features like HoverTool to show density values
    on hover
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram with KDE overlay showing "Daily
    Return (%)" on the x-axis and "Density" on the y-axis. The histogram bars are
    rendered in a semi-transparent blue color (#306998 with alpha 0.5), and the KDE
    curve is a yellow/gold line (#FFD43B) overlaid on top. The title "histogram-kde
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The legend in the top-right
    corner shows "Histogram" and "KDE" entries. The distribution is roughly centered
    around 0% with visible fat tails on both sides (negative around -10% and positive
    around +10-15%), representing realistic stock return behavior. Grid lines are
    dashed and subtle. The background is a light gray (#fafafa).

        comment: Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive hover tools or tooltips that
          could show bin values/density on hover; this is a missed opportunity for
          Bokeh's strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
