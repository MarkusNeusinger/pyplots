review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for readability at target resolution (28pt title, 22pt axes,
    18pt ticks)
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar with proper layering of geom_line and geom_point
  - Realistic business scenario with quarterly product performance showing distinct
    trends
  - Good color contrast between the three product lines
  - Markers are clearly visible against the lines with appropriate alpha (0.9)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha 0.5 is too prominent - should be 0.2-0.4 for subtlety
  - Could use different marker shapes for multiple series as suggested in the spec
