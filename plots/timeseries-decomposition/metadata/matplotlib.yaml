review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent four-panel layout with shared x-axis showing all decomposition components
    clearly
  - Realistic retail sales scenario with trend, annual seasonality, and December holiday
    bumps
  - Clean code structure using statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper decomposition
  - Appropriate line widths and grid styling for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels lack units (e.g., "Original (Sales USD)" would be more informative)
  - Uses two similar yellow shades for Trend and Residual which could be slightly
    confusing
  - Tick labels at 14pt are slightly below the 16pt guideline
  - Could leverage more matplotlib features like annotations or fill_between for visual
    enhancement
