review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of drill-down concept with two linked donut charts and
    connecting arrow
  - Realistic and meaningful portfolio data with proper asset class hierarchy
  - Clean visual design with well-chosen colors and consistent styling
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics for complex custom shapes
  - Proper title format and clear legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a function definition (create_donut_segment) which violates the KISS principle
    of no functions/classes; consider inlining the polygon generation logic
  - The right donut (Equities Breakdown) is positioned slightly higher than the left,
    creating minor visual asymmetry
  image_description: 'The plot displays two donut charts side-by-side on a light gray
    (#FAFAFA) background. On the left is the main "Portfolio Allocation" donut showing
    four asset classes: Equities (45%, blue #306998), Fixed Income (30%, yellow #FFD43B),
    Alternatives (15%, green #2ECC71), and Cash (10%, purple #9B59B6). The center
    of the left donut shows "Total" and "$1.2M". On the right is the "Equities Breakdown"
    donut showing the breakdown of the 45% equities allocation into four holdings:
    Tech Stocks (18%), Healthcare (12%), Financials (10%), and Energy (5%), displayed
    in varying shades of blue. A dashed arrow connects the Equities segment on the
    left to the breakdown donut on the right, indicating the drill-down relationship.
    The center of the right donut shows "45%" and "Equities". A horizontal legend
    at the bottom displays color-coded boxes for each asset class. Italic instruction
    text below explains the interactive concept. The title uses the correct format:
