review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts arearange series for band visualization with proper
    upper/lower bounds
  - Very clear visual hierarchy with contrasting band (blue, 0.3 alpha) and center
    line (yellow, solid)
  - Heteroscedastic uncertainty pattern demonstrates the value of band plots effectively
  - Proper zIndex layering ensures center line renders on top of band
  - Large, readable text sizes throughout (64px title, 48px axis labels, 36px tick
    labels)
  - Clean Selenium-based PNG export with proper image cropping
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (s)" or "Value (units)" would be more informative)
  - Uses raw dictionary configuration instead of highcharts-core Python library classes
    as shown in library rules
  - Legend could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas size
