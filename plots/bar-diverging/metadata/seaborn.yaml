review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of diverging bar chart with clear visual distinction
    between positive and negative values
  - Proper use of horizontal orientation for readable department labels
  - Well-implemented value labels at end of each bar with correct positioning and
    sign formatting
  - Good sorting of bars by value for easy comparison
  - Modern seaborn API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clean zero baseline with solid black line provides clear reference point
  weaknesses:
  - Legend slightly overlaps with the Sales bar visual area - could be placed in upper
    left instead
  - Data scenario is somewhat generic - could use more specific real-world context
    (e.g., specific industry or year)
  image_description: The plot shows a horizontal diverging bar chart displaying Net
    Promoter Scores by Department. The chart features 12 departments on the y-axis
    (Operations at top, Sales at bottom) sorted by NPS score from lowest to highest.
    Bars extend left (negative/yellow) or right (positive/blue) from a central black
    vertical baseline at zero. Blue bars represent "Positive (Promoters)" ranging
    from +8 to +62, while yellow/gold bars represent "Negative (Detractors)" ranging
    from -8 to -45. Each bar has a value label showing the score (e.g., +55, -32).
    The title is "bar-diverging · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. X-axis
    shows "Net Promoter Score" from -60 to 80, Y-axis shows "Department". A legend
    in the lower right explains the color coding. Grid lines are subtle dashed vertical
    lines.

        comment: Uses seaborn's barplot correctly with hue parameter for modern API,
          but doesn't leverage seaborn-specific features like statistical aggregation
          or built-in themes
  verdict: APPROVED
