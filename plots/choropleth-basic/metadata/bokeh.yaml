review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features including LogColorMapper for better differentiation
    of low-density states
  - Smart contrast handling with dynamic text colors (white on dark, blue on light
    backgrounds)
  - Good missing data handling demonstrated with DC shown in gray
  - Clean tile grid approach that fits all 50 states + DC in a readable layout
  - Well-implemented color bar with logarithmic scale and clear labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly "choropleth-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" without
    the "US Population Density" prefix
  - Tile grid approach, while creative and readable, differs from traditional geographic
    projection that spec mentions (Robinson for world, Albers for US)
