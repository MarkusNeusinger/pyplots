quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of jitter to prevent overplotting while keeping points within category
    boundaries
  - Horizontal mean lines provide useful reference for comparing group averages
  - Distinct colors for each department make categories easily distinguishable
  - Appropriate alpha transparency (0.6) handles point overlap well
  - Clean background styling with subtle grid enhances readability
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or scale context (e.g., Survey Score (1-10))
  - No legend explaining what the horizontal lines represent (group means)
