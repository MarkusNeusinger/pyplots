review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a PDP with proper confidence intervals and rug plot
    for data distribution
  - Housing price prediction scenario is highly relatable and demonstrates real ML
    interpretability use case
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Appropriate centering of partial dependence at zero for easier interpretation
    as recommended in spec
  - Good color accessibility with blue/yellow palette
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is slightly too prominent; could be reduced to 0.2 for more
    subtle appearance
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features (e.g., seaborn statistical estimation
    capabilities or figure-level functions)
  - The partial_dependence API from sklearn is older; modern approach uses PartialDependenceDisplay
  image_description: The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) showing the
    marginal effect of "Square Feet (standardized)" on the predicted outcome. The
    main line is solid blue (#306998) with a light blue shaded confidence band (95%
    CI) around it. The y-axis shows "Partial Dependence (centered)" ranging from approximately
    -40 to +40. The x-axis ranges from about -2.5 to 3.5. A dashed horizontal gray
    line at y=0 provides a reference baseline. A yellow/gold rug plot along the bottom
    x-axis shows the distribution of training data. The title follows the correct
    format "pdp-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left clearly
    identifies the confidence interval and partial dependence line. The overall curve
    shows a positive monotonic relationship between square feet and partial dependence,
    which aligns with the housing price scenario.
