review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast with adaptive color (white on dark, dark blue on light
    cells)
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper layer ordering
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with plausible confusion patterns
  - Square aspect ratio (coord_fixed) perfect for confusion matrix
  - Good use of categorical ordering to control axis display
  - Cell borders (white, size=2) provide clear separation
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from displaying percentages alongside or instead of raw counts for
    easier interpretation
  - Legend colorbar title could be more descriptive (e.g., Sample Count)
