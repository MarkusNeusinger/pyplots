review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of inverted Y-axis to show rank 1 at top (as required by spec)
  - Clean, professional appearance with plotly_white template
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Appropriate marker and line sizes for clear visibility
  - Interactive HTML output alongside PNG leverages plotly strengths
  - Data tells a compelling story with Team Alpha rise and Team Gamma brief lead in
    Week 5
  weaknesses:
  - Data is deterministic so seed is not technically needed, but consider adding np.random.seed
    for consistency if random data is ever used
  - Layout balance could be improved with legend placement closer to plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing sports league standings
    over 6 weeks. The Y-axis shows ranks from 1 (top) to 5 (bottom) with rank 1 correctly
    positioned at the top (inverted axis). The X-axis shows "Period" with Week 1 through
    Week 6. Five teams are tracked with distinct colored lines and circular markers:
    Team Alpha (blue #306998), Team Beta (yellow #FFD43B), Team Gamma (green #2ecc71),
    Team Delta (red #e74c3c), and Team Epsilon (purple #9b59b6). The lines effectively
    show ranking changes - Team Alpha rises from 3rd to 1st, Team Beta falls from
    1st to 2nd, Team Gamma has dynamic movement including briefly taking 1st in Week
    5. The title reads "bump-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" at top left. The legend
    is positioned to the right of the plot area. The background uses plotly_white
    template with subtle grid lines.'
