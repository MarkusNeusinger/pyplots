review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable implementation following KISS principles with proper seeding for
    reproducibility
  - Effective use of jitter to prevent point overlap within categories
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=150) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  - Professional-looking plot with proper axis labels and title formatting
  - Good color differentiation between categories using Python-themed colors
  weaknesses:
  - Performance scores exceed 100 in Design category (values up to ~112) which is
    unrealistic for a typical 0-100 performance metric - consider clamping or adjusting
    the distribution
  - No legend explaining what the colors represent (even though colors map to x-axis
    categories, a legend would add clarity)
  - Axis labels lack units - Performance Score (%) or (0-100) would be more informative
