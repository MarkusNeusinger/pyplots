review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of frequency spectrum with clear, distinct peaks at 50
    Hz, 120 Hz, and 200 Hz matching the synthetic signal
  - Proper use of dB scale for amplitude representation, making the spectrum analysis
    realistic
  - Well-configured canvas size (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled font sizes for
    readability
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle grid lines and good color contrast
  - Appropriate data preprocessing including FFT computation, normalization, and frequency
    limiting
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with fill for area-under-curve visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing peak annotations or markers to highlight the dominant frequency components
    as suggested in the specification
  - Font sizes in the custom style are quite large (title_font_size=72) which may
    be excessive; could be slightly reduced for better proportions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a frequency spectrum visualization with three
    distinct peaks at the expected frequencies: 50 Hz (dominant peak reaching ~10
    dB), 120 Hz (secondary peak at ~2 dB), and 200 Hz (tertiary peak at ~-5 dB). The
    visualization uses a filled area chart in Python Blue (#306998) against a white
    background. The noise floor is visible around -30 to -40 dB with natural variation.
    The title "spectrum-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels
    clearly show "Frequency (Hz)" on the X-axis (0-300 Hz range) and "Amplitude (dB)"
    on the Y-axis (-60 to 20 dB range). Grid lines are subtle and non-distracting.
    The layout is well-balanced with good use of canvas space.'

        comment: Good use of pygal's XY chart type, custom Style for large canvas,
          fill option for area chart effect. Could have used more pygal-specific features
