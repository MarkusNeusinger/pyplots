review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lollipop chart using clever combination of scatter
    (dots) and column (stems) series
  - Data is properly sorted in descending order for optimal readability as recommended
    in spec
  - Data labels positioned above markers provide clear value indication
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color choice
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Good use of marginBottom to prevent x-axis label clipping
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend score slightly reduced as grid style could be more subtle (alpha lower)
  - Layout has slight imbalance due to large bottom margin creating extra whitespace
  - 'Could leverage more Highcharts interactive features (tooltips are disabled via
    enableMouseTracking: False on stems)'
