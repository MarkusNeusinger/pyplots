review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data diversity showing normal, bimodal, tight, and wide distributions
    with outliers — demonstrates all advantages of raincloud plots
  - Three well-crafted annotations with category-matching border colors create a clear
    data narrative
  - Cohesive blue-teal-purple palette is colorblind-safe and visually harmonious
  - All font sizes explicitly set with intentional hierarchy (32/24/20/15/14pt)
  - Dual output (PNG + interactive HTML with range slider) leverages Plotly interactive
    strengths
  - Clean raincloud metaphor with cloud above, box centered, rain below — correct
    orientation throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps with Treatment C violin area — should be repositioned (e.g., below
    the plot or in a less crowded area)
  - Rain point markers (size 7) are slightly small for this canvas resolution; increasing
    to 8-9 would improve visibility
  - Annotation blocks are repetitive — a loop with a config list would reduce verbosity
  - The explicit x-axis range [210, 700] may crop a few data points near the boundaries
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with four experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) on the y-axis and
    Reaction Time (ms) on the x-axis (range ~210–700). Each condition features three
    layered components: a half-violin (cloud) extending upward from the category baseline,
    a narrow white-filled box plot centered on the baseline with dark edges, and jittered
    scatter points (rain) falling below the baseline. The color palette uses a cohesive
    blue-teal scheme: deep blue (#306998) for Control, medium blue (#4B8BBE) for Treatment
    A, teal (#2A9D8F) for Treatment B, and soft purple (#7B68AE) for Treatment C.
    Three annotations with bordered callout boxes highlight key data features: "Outliers"
    pointing to high values in Control, "Tight cluster (low variance)" for Treatment
    A''s narrow distribution, and "Bimodal: two distinct response clusters" for Treatment
    B''s dual-peaked shape. The title "raincloud-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. A legend labeled "Condition" sits in the upper right. The background
    is white with subtle vertical gridlines.'
