quality_score: 52
review:
  strengths:
  - Uses viridis colormap as specified for perceptual uniformity
  - Includes color bar legend with clear Vehicle Count title
  - Realistic GPS data scenario with multiple density clusters (downtown, shopping
    district)
  - Proper axis labels with units (Longitude °W, Latitude °N)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Interactive tooltips showing coordinates and vehicle counts
  - Uses Altair declarative syntax appropriately
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Hexagons render as rectangles - The custom SVG path approach does not
    produce visible hexagonal shapes in the output'
  - Contains helper function hexbin_aggregate() which violates KISS code structure
    requirement
  - Bins lack proper hexagonal tessellation pattern with offset rows
  - White stroke between bins too thin to show hexagonal outlines
