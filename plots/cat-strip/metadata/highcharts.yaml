review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts built-in jitter feature for proper strip plot behavior
  - 'Thoughtful data design showing different distribution characteristics: tight
    vs wide spread, outliers, bimodal patterns'
  - Colorblind-safe palette following library guidelines
  - Clean rendering with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - White marker borders add visual clarity and separation between overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in top-right corner encroaches on the data visualization area
  - Points lack alpha/transparency which would help visualize density in overlapping
    areas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical strip plot showing plant height
    measurements (cm) across four treatment groups: Control, Fertilizer A, Fertilizer
    B, and Fertilizer C. The title "cat-strip · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top center. The x-axis shows "Treatment Group" with four category labels,
    and the y-axis shows "Plant Height (cm)" ranging from approximately 7-42 cm. Each
    category has its own color: Control (blue #306998), Fertilizer A (yellow #FFD43B),
    Fertilizer B (purple #9467BD), and Fertilizer C (cyan #17BECF). Points are jittered
    horizontally within each category to prevent overlap. A legend appears in the
    top-right corner with a white background and border. The plot has subtle gray
    gridlines and a clean white background.'
