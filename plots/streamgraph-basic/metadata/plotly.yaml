review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of centered baseline algorithm creating true streamgraph
    appearance
  - Smooth spline curves create the flowing, organic look specified
  - Python Blue/Yellow color scheme with harmonious colorblind-safe palette
  - Proper use of Plotly fill=toself for creating the stacked areas
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good font sizing for all text elements at target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Streaming Hours (Millions) is slightly confusing when the centered
    baseline creates negative values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a streamgraph showing monthly streaming hours
    by music genre (Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Jazz, Classical) over a 2-year
    period from early 2022 to late 2023. The streamgraph uses a centered baseline
    creating a symmetric, river-like appearance around the x-axis. Colors used are:
    Python Blue (#306998) for Pop at the bottom, Yellow (#FFD43B) for Rock, Red/Orange
    (#E24A33) for Hip-Hop, Green (#8EBA42) for Electronic, Purple (#988ED5) for Jazz,
    and Light Blue (#348ABD) for Classical at the top. The title "streamgraph-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Month" with quarterly
    date labels, and the y-axis shows "Streaming Hours (Millions)" ranging from -100
    to 100. A horizontal legend is positioned above the plot area. The curves are
    smooth and flowing, with subtle grid lines in the background.'
