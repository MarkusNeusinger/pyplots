review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal distribution that clearly demonstrates the value of combining
    KDE with rug marks
  - Realistic API response time scenario makes the visualization immediately understandable
  - Clean, idiomatic plotnine code using grammar of graphics properly
  - Good visual balance with appropriate alpha values for density fill (0.5) and rug
    marks (0.4)
  - Title follows correct format specification
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks could be slightly longer/more prominent for better visibility at lower
    densities
  - Could demonstrate more extreme outliers to better showcase rug mark utility
  image_description: The plot displays a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve with
    rug marks along the x-axis. The density curve is filled with a semi-transparent
    blue color (#306998 at 50% opacity) and outlined with a solid blue line. The distribution
    shows a clear bimodal pattern with a dominant peak around 120ms (representing
    fast API responses) and a smaller secondary peak around 280ms (slower responses).
    Rug marks appear as small vertical tick marks in blue along the bottom of the
    plot, clearly showing where individual data points fall - dense clustering is
    visible around both modes with sparser marks in between and at the tails. The
    title "density-rug · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis
    is labeled "Response Time (ms)" and the y-axis is labeled "Density". Grid lines
    are subtle with appropriate alpha values. The plot uses a 16:9 aspect ratio with
    good canvas utilization and balanced margins.
