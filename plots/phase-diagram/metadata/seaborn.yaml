review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of phase space dynamics with clear spiral trajectories
    converging to equilibrium
  - Well-chosen physics example (damped harmonic oscillator) that perfectly demonstrates
    the plot type
  - Starting points clearly marked with large scatter markers distinguishing each
    trajectory
  - Direction arrows effectively show time evolution along the trajectories
  - Reference lines (dashed gray at x=0 and y=0) help identify equilibrium crossing
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with hue for trajectory differentiation
  - Clean readable code with analytical solution for underdamped oscillator
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning and styling could be improved - the Equilibrium marker is added
    separately and its legend entry appears disconnected
  - Inner portions of spirals become dense and harder to distinguish near the origin
  - Could benefit from using a colorblind-friendly palette instead of custom colors
  image_description: 'The plot shows a phase diagram (state space plot) for a damped
    harmonic oscillator. Four spiral trajectories are displayed, each starting from
    different initial conditions marked by large colored dots: blue (2.0, 0.0), yellow
    (0.0, 8.0), red/orange (-1.5, -5.0), and teal (1.0, 4.0). All trajectories spiral
    inward toward the equilibrium point at the origin, marked with a black ''X''.
    The x-axis shows Position (x) ranging from about -1.5 to 2.0, and the y-axis shows
    Velocity (dx/dt) ranging from about -10 to 7.5. Dashed gray reference lines cross
    at the origin. Direction arrows are visible on the trajectories showing time evolution.
    The title follows the correct format: "phase-diagram · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    A legend in the upper right identifies each trajectory by its initial condition.
    The background uses seaborn''s whitegrid style.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with hue grouping and sns.set_style, but direction
          arrows are done with matplotlib's annotate rather than leveraging seaborn
          further
  verdict: APPROVED
