review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly figure_factory.create_quiver for native quiver plot support
  - Good combination of arrows with scatter markers for magnitude encoding
  - Proper Viridis colorscale for colorblind accessibility
  - Interactive hover templates provide detailed information
  - HTML output enables full plotly interactivity
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate 15x15 grid density for visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra descriptor before spec-id format
  - Axis labels lack units
  - Zero lines are slightly more prominent than grid lines
  - X-axis range extends unnecessarily wide when data only spans -2 to 2
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 grid of blue arrows (#306998) on a
    white background, visualizing a circular rotation vector field. Each arrow represents
    a vector with direction following the pattern u = -y, v = x, creating a counterclockwise
    rotation around the origin. Colored circular markers at each arrow base encode
    magnitude using the Viridis colorscale (purple at center for low magnitude, yellow
    at corners for high magnitude). The title "Circular Flow Field · quiver-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Axis labels read "X Position" and
    "Y Position". A vertical colorbar on the right shows magnitude values from ~0.3
    to ~2.8. The grid is subtle with alpha transparency, and zero lines are visible
    at x=0 and y=0.

        comment: Uses figure_factory.create_quiver for specialized quiver plot; adds
          interactive hover templates; generates HTML for interactivity; could leverage
          more plotly-specific features like animation
  verdict: APPROVED
