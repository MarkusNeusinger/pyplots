review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the grouped lollipop concept with proper spacing and
    positioning
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with good organization
  - Professional color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of zorder to ensure markers appear above stems
  - White edge highlighting on markers adds polish
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper right could be moved to avoid proximity to data area
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features
  - Data values are somewhat uniform - more variation would better showcase the chart
    comparison capability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across four regions (North, South, East, West). Each region
    has three lollipops side by side representing Electronics (blue #306998), Furniture
    (yellow #FFD43B), and Clothing (green #4CAF50). The stems are thin vertical lines
    extending from a baseline at y=0 up to circular markers. The title reads "lollipop-grouped
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. The y-axis shows "Revenue ($ millions)"
    ranging from 0 to approximately 6.5, and the x-axis shows "Region". A legend in
    the upper right identifies the three series. A subtle dashed horizontal grid is
    present on the y-axis. The data shows variation across regions - East has the
    highest Electronics revenue (~5.5M), while Furniture values vary considerably
    across regions.'
