review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    clearly differentiating the series
  - Realistic temperature data context with appropriate seasonal patterns across different
    climate regions
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good font sizing throughout meeting the 4800×2700 target resolution requirements
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage seaborn native palette system instead of manually specifying colors
  - Data context is generic (Coastal, Continental) rather than specific real-world
    regions
