review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm that produces non-overlapping bubbles packed
    efficiently toward center
  - Clean visual design with appropriate colors from seaborn Set2 palette
  - Smart labeling strategy that places text inside large circles and uses annotations
    for smaller ones
  - Realistic market cap data scenario that makes the visualization meaningful and
    relatable
  - Proper area-based scaling (sqrt of value) for accurate visual perception of relative
    sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn library features are underutilized; most visualization logic is custom
    matplotlib code with seaborn providing only the scatter layer
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart showing company market
    values by sector. The chart contains approximately 17 circles of varying sizes
    packed together without overlap. Colors encode four sectors: Technology (green/teal),
    Finance (orange/coral), Healthcare (blue/lavender), and Retail (pink). The largest
    bubbles are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Most company names appear as
    white bold text inside their respective bubbles. The title "bubble-packed · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black bold text. A legend at the bottom right
    shows the four sector categories with colored squares. The background is white,
    and circles have white edge strokes separating them visually.'

        max: 5
        passed: true
        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with hue/size mapping and sns.set_style, but
          the core visualization relies heavily on matplotlib patches and custom packing
          logic. Seaborn's role is somewhat limited to the scatter call and styling.
  verdict: APPROVED
