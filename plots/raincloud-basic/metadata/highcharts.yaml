review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud on right, rain on left, boxplot centered (matches
    vertical orientation spec)
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple, cyan) with good visual distinction
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B clearly visible in density cloud
  - Title format correct with spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
  - Appropriate jitter amount (0.08) for scatter points
  - Inline KDE calculation creates smooth density curves
  weaknesses:
  - Box plots lack visual prominence - median line barely visible against colored
    fill, quartile boundaries hard to distinguish
  - No grid lines present - adding subtle grid would improve y-axis value readability
  - Legend icon for Box Plot does not match actual colored box plot appearance
  - Box plot fill colors are fully opaque and same as density colors, making the box
    plot boundaries hard to see against the density polygons
