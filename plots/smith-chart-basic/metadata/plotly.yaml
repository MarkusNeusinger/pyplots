review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart grid with proper constant resistance circles
    and constant reactance arcs clipped to unit circle
  - 'Proper RF engineering math: impedance normalization and reflection coefficient
    calculation are correct'
  - Well-designed frequency annotations with arrow pointers and varied positions to
    avoid overlap
  - Interactive hover text shows frequency and complex impedance values
  - Clean visual hierarchy with blue primary color and yellow accent markers
  weaknesses:
  - Axis range extends to ±2.0 while the Smith chart boundary is at ±1.15, leaving
    unused whitespace outside the chart
  - Legend placement in upper-left corner is somewhat isolated from the chart area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance visualization.
    The chart features a blue circular boundary representing |Γ| = 1 (total reflection).
    Inside, gray constant resistance circles and constant reactance arcs form the
    characteristic Smith chart grid. The impedance locus is plotted as a connected
    curve with blue lines (width ~4) and yellow circular markers with blue outlines.
    Four frequency labels (1.0 GHz, 2.6 GHz, 4.3 GHz, 6.0 GHz) are annotated with
    arrows pointing to their respective positions on the curve, displayed in boxed
    labels with blue borders. A yellow X marker at the center indicates the matched
    condition (Z = Z₀). The legend in the upper-left shows ''Impedance Locus'' and
    ''Matched (Z = Z₀)''. Axis labels read ''Real(Γ)'' and ''Imag(Γ)'' with tick fonts
    appropriately sized. The title follows the correct format: ''smith-chart-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai''. Resistance labels (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) appear along
    the horizontal axis, and reactance labels (+j0.5, -j0.5, +j1, -j1) are placed
    near the chart boundary.'
