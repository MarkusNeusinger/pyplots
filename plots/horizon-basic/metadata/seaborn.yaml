review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data generation with distinct server behavior patterns (Web
    Server daily cycle, Database spikes, Cache periodic flushes, Auth login spikes)
  - Clean implementation of horizon chart folding technique with 3 bands
  - Good use of blue sequential color palette for the bands
  - Well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper subplot layout with shared x-axis and minimal spacing
  weaknesses:
  - Does not import or use seaborn library - this is a pure matplotlib implementation
    that should fail AR-05
  - Missing positive/negative mirroring with contrasting colors (spec mentions blue/red)
  - Title format incorrect - should be "horizon-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" not
    "Server CPU Usage · horizon-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
  - Text sizes slightly below recommended (title 22pt vs 24pt, labels 14pt vs 20pt)
  - No grid lines to help track values across time periods
