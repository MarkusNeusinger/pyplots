review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinates with proper Cartesian transformation
  - Real-world soil composition context with sand/silt/clay is pedagogically valuable
  - Clean grid system with consistent 20% intervals on all three axes
  - Proper marker sizing and transparency for 50 data points
  - Well-formatted title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Data points cluster toward the center; consider adjusting Dirichlet alpha parameters
    to show more edge/corner cases
  - Layout uses 16:9 aspect ratio but triangle is inherently more square, causing
    some wasted horizontal space
