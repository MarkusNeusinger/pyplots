review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of quiver plot using line series with null separators
    in a library without native vector field support
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (cyan → green → yellow → orange) for magnitude
    encoding
  - Clear circular rotation pattern demonstrates the vector field concept effectively
  - Properly sized text elements for high-resolution output
  - Well-structured legend with magnitude categories
  - Good use of arrowheads to show direction
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: The helper function magnitude_to_color violates the KISS structure guideline
    (no functions)'
  - Grid lines configured but not visible in the output - the dashed grid was specified
    but does not appear
