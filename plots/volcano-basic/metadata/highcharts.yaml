review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with blue (#306998), orange (#E07B00), and gray
    (#999999)
  - All three threshold lines (horizontal p-value, two vertical fold change) are clearly
    labeled with annotations
  - Legend includes count of points in each category, enhancing interpretability
  - Realistic differential gene expression data with appropriate distribution of significant
    vs non-significant genes
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations module for threshold labels
  - Interactive HTML version also generated for web viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Marker opacity/transparency not implemented (spec mentions using alpha transparency
    for overlapping points)
  - Code structure is lengthy due to Selenium screenshot approach, but this is inherent
    to Highcharts
  image_description: 'The plot displays a volcano plot for differential gene expression
    analysis. The chart has a white background with a title "volcano-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" at the top in bold black text, followed by a subtitle "Differential
    Gene Expression Analysis". The x-axis shows "log₂(Fold Change)" ranging from approximately
    -4.75 to 5.75, and the y-axis shows "-log₁₀(p-value)" ranging from 0 to 11. Three
    series of data points are displayed: gray circles for "Not Significant (323)"
    points clustered mainly in the center, blue circles for "Down-regulated (85)"
    points on the left side (negative fold change), and orange circles for "Up-regulated
    (92)" points on the right side (positive fold change). Vertical dashed lines mark
    the fold change thresholds at -1 and +1 (labeled "FC = -1" and "FC = +1"), and
    a horizontal dashed line at approximately y=1.3 marks the p-value significance
    threshold (labeled "p = 0.05"). The legend is positioned in the upper right corner
    with clear labeling and counts for each category.'
