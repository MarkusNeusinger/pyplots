review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to simulate quiver plot using pygal XY chart with line segments
    for arrows
  - Excellent color-coded magnitude representation using 5 distinct wind speed categories
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic wind flow scenario with counterclockwise rotation around low-pressure
    center
  - Good use of canvas space with legend positioned at bottom in 5 columns
  weaknesses:
  - Arrow stroke width is too thin making some vectors difficult to see, especially
    lower magnitude ones
  - Grid lines through center (0,0) are visually dominant and distract from the data
  - The Calm category in legend shows no arrows since very weak vectors are filtered
    out, making it misleading
