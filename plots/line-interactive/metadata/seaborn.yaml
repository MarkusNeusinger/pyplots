review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with proper text sizing and colorblind-safe palette
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic temperature data with proper seasonal patterns
  - Creative attempt to simulate interactive features with annotations and highlighted
    regions
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Seaborn cannot provide true interactivity (hover, zoom, pan, range
    selection) - these are fundamental spec requirements'
  - The annotation and shaded region are static visual approximations, not actual
    interactive features
  - For this spec, an interactive library (plotly, bokeh, altair, highcharts, or letsplot)
    would be required
