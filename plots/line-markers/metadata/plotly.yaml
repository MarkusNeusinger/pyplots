review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent marker visibility with distinct shapes (circle, square, diamond) for
    each series
  - White border lines on markers provide excellent contrast against the lines
  - Clean, professional layout with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Good use of Plotly graph_objects for fine-grained control over styling
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML, showcasing Plotly dual capability
  - Realistic temperature sensor scenario that fits the sparse data use case well
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned outside the plot area (e.g., to the right) to avoid
    any potential overlap with data
  - Hover templates or other interactive features could better showcase Plotly distinctive
    capabilities
