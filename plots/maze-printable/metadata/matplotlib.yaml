review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent DFS maze generation algorithm that guarantees solvable maze
  - Perfect print-friendly black/white design with optimal wall thickness
  - Clean, minimalist presentation with axes/spines hidden appropriately
  - Correct title format and well-positioned start/goal markers
  - Square aspect ratio ideal for maze puzzles
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features (e.g., Rectangle patches for walls
    instead of imshow)
  - Maze context is generic; could benefit from a thematic scenario
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 cell maze puzzle on a white background
    with black walls. The maze has a clean, print-friendly design with consistent
    wall thickness. The start position is marked with a blue "S" in the top-left corner,
    and the goal is marked with a blue "G" in the bottom-right corner. The title "maze-printable
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text. The maze is square-formatted
    and fills most of the canvas with balanced margins. The maze structure shows a
    complex network of passages generated by the DFS algorithm, guaranteeing a single
    solution path.
