review:
  strengths:
  - Implements full Code 128B encoding with correct start pattern, check digit calculation
    (modulo 103), and stop pattern
  - Creative use of seaborn heatmap to render binary barcode data
  - Clean white background with high-contrast blue bars for scan reliability
  - Proper quiet zones on both sides as required by spec
  - Human-readable text below barcode for visual verification
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - The encoding tables are extensive (200+ lines) which adds complexity, though necessary
    for proper Code 128 implementation
  - Could leverage seaborn color palette features more distinctively
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode rendered using seaborn's
    heatmap function. The barcode consists of blue (#306998) vertical bars on a white
    background, representing the encoded string "SHIP-2024-ABC123". The title "barcode-code128
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark gray text. The human-readable
    text "SHIP-2024-ABC123" is displayed below the barcode in blue monospace font.
    The barcode includes proper quiet zones (white space) on both sides. The overall
    layout is clean with the barcode well-centered and taking up appropriate canvas
    space.
