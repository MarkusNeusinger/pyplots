review:
  strengths:
  - Perfectly structured plotnine grammar-of-graphics chain with explicit theme customization
  - All font sizes explicitly set matching the library rules (title 24pt, labels 20pt,
    ticks 16pt)
  - Clean fill+stroke marker technique using shape="o" with separate fill and color
    aesthetics
  - Realistic and neutral educational data context (study hours vs exam scores)
  - Spec compliance is flawless — all required features present
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: adding a trend line (stat_smooth), R² annotation, or key-point
    callouts would elevate the narrative'
  - Exam scores exceed 100 (up to ~105) which breaks realism for a 0-100 exam scale
    — clamp or adjust the noise model
  - Markers could be slightly larger (size=5) for better visual presence at 150 data
    points
  - Design stays at well-configured default level — adding a subtitle, refined color
    palette, or annotation would push toward publication quality
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart titled "scatter-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" on a white background with subtle gray major grid lines. 150 steel-blue
    filled circular markers with thin white edge strokes are plotted, showing study
    hours per week (x-axis, range ~1–10) versus exam scores in points (y-axis, range
    ~20–105). A clear positive linear correlation is visible with moderate noise.
    The markers use alpha=0.7 transparency. Font sizes are well-scaled: the title
    is large and centered at top, axis labels are prominent, and tick labels are clearly
    readable. The layout is 16:9 landscape with balanced margins. No legend is present
    (single series). Minor grid lines are suppressed.'
