review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing diverse distributions with outliers, tight spreads,
    and wide spreads
  - Categories correctly sorted by median for easier comparison (as suggested in spec)
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clean alternating color palette that aids visual distinction between categories
  - All text sizes optimized for the 4800×2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Color alternation (blue/yellow) is decorative rather than conveying meaning -
    a single color or sequential palette might be cleaner
  - Could use sns.set_context() for more consistent seaborn styling
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response times
    (in milliseconds) for 5 different service types. The boxes are oriented horizontally
    with categories on the y-axis (Cache Lookup, API Gateway, Authentication, Database
    Query, File Upload - sorted by median value) and response time on the x-axis (0-1100ms).
    Colors alternate between blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B). Each box shows the
    median line, quartile box, whiskers extending to ~1.5×IQR, and outliers as hollow
    circles. The title "box-horizontal · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the
    top. Grid lines are subtle dashed vertical lines. The plot demonstrates varying
    distributions: Cache Lookup is very tight and fast (~25ms), while File Upload
    has a wide spread (400-600ms) with outliers near 1000ms.'

        comment: Uses seaborn's boxplot with proper hue/palette handling, order parameter,
          and flierprops customization. Could leverage more seaborn-specific features
          like style context.
  verdict: APPROVED
