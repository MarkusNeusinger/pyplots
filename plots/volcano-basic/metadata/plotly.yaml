review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of volcano plot with all required threshold lines and
    color coding
  - Proper use of Plotly hover templates showing gene name, fold change, and p-value
  - Clean three-color scheme (gray/blue/orange) that is colorblind accessible
  - Appropriate marker sizing and alpha transparency for the data density
  - Gene annotations with arrows for top significant hits
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend includes threshold line entries (p = 0.05, log2FC = 1.0) which adds visual
    clutter; threshold lines are self-explanatory from context
  - Some overlap in the dense central gray point cluster could benefit from slightly
    smaller markers or more transparency
  - Could utilize more Plotly-specific features like updatemenus or rangeslider for
    enhanced interactivity
