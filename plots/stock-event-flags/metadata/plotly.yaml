review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Candlestick trace for professional financial chart appearance
  - Interactive hover tooltips with custom hovertemplate showing event type, label,
    and date
  - Distinct visual encoding for each event type using both color and symbol shape
  - Proper OHLC data constraints ensuring realistic price relationships
  - Clean dashed connector lines from event markers to price level
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Well-organized legend with all event types clearly identified
  weaknesses:
  - The Price entry in the legend is redundant for a chart where candlesticks are
    self-explanatory as the main data series
  - All event flags are positioned at a fixed offset above price - alternating heights
    or smart placement could reduce visual clustering when events are close together
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price candlestick chart spanning from
    January 2024 to September 2024. The candlesticks use green for bullish (up) days
    and red for bearish (down) days. The price range spans approximately $110 to $170.
    Seven event flags are positioned above the price data with dashed vertical connector
    lines: three blue star markers for Earnings events (Q4 Beat, Q1 Miss, Q2 Beat),
    two green diamond markers for Dividend events (Div $0.50, Div $0.55), one orange
    triangle for News (Product Launch), and one purple square for Split (4:1 Split).
    The title "stock-event-flags · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    Y-axis shows "Price ($)" with dollar formatting, and the X-axis shows "Date" with
    monthly labels. A legend in the top-left corner identifies each event type with
    its corresponding symbol and color.'
