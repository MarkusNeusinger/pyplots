review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Data Matrix structure with correct L-finder and timing
    patterns
  - High contrast black/white rendering ideal for barcode visualization
  - Clean annotations explaining the barcode components
  - Proper quiet zone implementation as required by spec
  - Reproducible output with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Data pattern is simulated (random) rather than actual ECC 200 encoding of the
    stated content
  - The barcode could utilize more canvas space for better visual impact
  - Could demonstrate different matrix sizes as mentioned in spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 16×16 Data Matrix 2D barcode rendered as
    a grid of black and white square cells on a white background. The barcode correctly
    shows the L-shaped finder pattern with a solid black left column and solid black
    bottom row. The top row and right column display the alternating (clock) timing
    pattern as specified. The interior cells contain a pseudo-random data pattern
    representing encoded data. A white quiet zone surrounds the barcode. The title
    "datamatrix-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text.
    Below the barcode, blue monospace text reads "Data Matrix (16×16) • Encoded: SERIAL:12345678",
    and gray text at the bottom explains "L-finder (left+bottom) • Timing pattern
    (top+right) • ECC 200". The layout uses a square format appropriate for barcode
    visualization.'
