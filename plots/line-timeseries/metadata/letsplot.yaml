review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature pattern with realistic daily variation using sine
    wave + noise
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Smart date formatting with scale_x_datetime adapts well to year-long timeframe
  - Rotated x-axis labels prevent overlap while maintaining readability
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate grid styling
  - Correct figure sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more lets-plot specific features like tooltips or interactivity
  - Line thickness slightly heavy for 365 data points - could be reduced to 1.0
