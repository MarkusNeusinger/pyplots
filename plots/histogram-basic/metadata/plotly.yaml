review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect spec compliance including correct title format and Y-axis starting at
    zero
  - Realistic exam score scenario that demonstrates histogram use case well
  - Clean KISS code structure following all conventions
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Plotly dual-output capability
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3)
    for better readability
  - Data distribution could include more pronounced outliers to better demonstrate
    histogram ability to reveal distribution shape
  - Could leverage Plotly hover template feature to show bin ranges and counts on
    hover in the HTML version
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of exam scores with a blue color
    (#306998). The x-axis shows "Score (points)" ranging from approximately 45 to
    100, and the y-axis shows "Frequency (count)" ranging from 0 to 45. The title
    correctly reads "histogram-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The
    histogram shows a slightly right-skewed distribution with a main peak around 75
    points and a secondary bump around 88-90, reflecting the bimodal data generation
    (main distribution at 72, high performers at 88). Bars have white borders creating
    clear separation. The background is clean white with subtle gray gridlines. Overall
    layout is well-balanced with good margins.

        comment: Uses go.Histogram correctly with proper Plotly layout customization;
          also generates interactive HTML output which is a Plotly strength; however,
          doesn't leverage hover templates or other advanced Plotly interactivity
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
