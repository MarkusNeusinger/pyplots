review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for sizing
  - Realistic business data scenario (monthly sales by category)
  - Proper descending sort order for the bar chart
  - Uses value_formatter for currency display
  - Horizontal orientation is appropriate for category labels
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels not appearing on Y-axis next to bars - viewers must match bars
    to legend at bottom
  - Value labels (print_values=True) not rendering on the bars despite being configured
  - Legend displays even though show_legend=False is set in the code
  - Title includes extra text before the required format
