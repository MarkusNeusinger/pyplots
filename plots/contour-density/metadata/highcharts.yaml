review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE-based density contours using a custom marching
    squares algorithm
  - Outstanding colorblind-safe viridis-inspired color palette for density gradient
    visualization
  - Effective combination of scatter overlay with contour lines for context
  - Well-designed legend with density scale representation
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations for inline contour level labels
  - Clean data generation showing three distinct clusters of varying densities
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently using Dot style which is adequate but
    slightly prominent)
  - Scatter points are somewhat small relative to the contour line thickness
  image_description: "The plot displays a density contour visualization with three\
    \ distinct clusters of data points. The title reads \"contour-density · highcharts\
    \ · pyplots.ai\" at the top. The X-axis is labeled \"Measurement A (normalized\
    \ units)\" ranging from approximately -5 to 5.75, and the Y-axis is labeled \"\
    Measurement B (normalized units)\" ranging from approximately -6 to 7.5. \n\n\
    Three clusters are clearly visible: a high-density cluster in the upper-right\
    \ area (around x=2.5, y=3), a medium-density cluster in the left-center area (around\
    \ x=-1.5, y=1), and a lower-density cluster in the bottom-center area (around\
    \ x=0.5, y=-1.5). The contours use a viridis-inspired colorblind-safe color scheme\
    \ progressing from dark purple (10%) through teal (50%) to yellow (90%) for the\
    \ highest density regions. Semi-transparent blue scatter points are overlaid on\
    \ the contours. A legend on the right shows \"Density Scale\" with entries for\
    \ Data Points and density levels (90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, 10%). Contour level annotations\
    \ (20%, 50%, 80%) appear directly on the plot."
