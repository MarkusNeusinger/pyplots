review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn colorblind palette ensuring accessibility
  - Clean visual design with appropriate white borders separating rectangles
  - Good text contrast with automatic luminance-based color selection for labels
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that demonstrates treemap purpose effectively
  - Legend well-organized horizontally at bottom showing all categories clearly
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn has no native treemap function - only sns.set_style() and color palette
    are used while actual treemap is drawn entirely with matplotlib Rectangle patches
  - Manual squarify algorithm implementation adds code complexity that could be avoided
    with a dedicated library
  - Missing explicit random seed declaration
  - Hierarchy visualization could be enhanced with color shading intensity to show
    nesting depth as mentioned in spec
