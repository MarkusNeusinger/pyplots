review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent DFS maze generation algorithm that guarantees a single solution path
  - Clean black-and-white printable design with consistent wall thickness
  - Proper use of theme_void() for print-friendly output
  - Well-positioned S/G markers outside the maze boundaries
  - Square aspect ratio (1200x1200 scaled 3x) is appropriate for the maze format
  - Proper coordinate transformation to display maze with entrance at top-left
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage any distinctive lets-plot features (no interactivity, tooltips,
    or unique styling)
  image_description: The plot displays a 25×25 printable maze puzzle with black walls
    on a white background. The maze is rendered using filled rectangles (geom_rect)
    creating a clean grid pattern. An "S" marker in blue (#306998) is positioned at
    the top-left corner just above the entrance opening, and a "G" marker in the same
    blue color is at the bottom-right just below the exit opening. The title "maze-printable
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in gray text. The maze uses
    theme_void() for a clean printable appearance with no axes, gridlines, or other
    chrome. The maze walls are consistently thick and the passages are wide enough
    for pen/pencil marking. The entrance is at the top-left and exit at the bottom-right
    of the outer wall.
