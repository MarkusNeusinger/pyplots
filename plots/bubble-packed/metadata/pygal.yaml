review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation using pygal XML filter to draw custom packed
    bubbles since pygal lacks native packed bubble chart
  - Clean packing algorithm that places circles without overlap and keeps them centered
  - Good color palette with four distinct group colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Proper area-based scaling using sqrt for accurate visual perception
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  - Correct title format and legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Value labels show only dollar amounts without category names - larger circles
    could fit abbreviated labels
  - Some smaller circles have cramped or small value labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart representing department
    budget allocation across four groups: Technology (blue), Marketing (yellow), Operations
    (teal/cyan), and Sales (coral/pink). The largest bubble in the center shows "$450K"
    (Software Development, Technology group). Circles are well-packed without overlap,
    with sizes proportional to budget values ranging from $90K to $450K. White value
    labels appear inside larger bubbles. The title "bubble-packed · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is at the top center. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows the four group categories
    with color indicators. The background is white with subtle dark outlines around
    each circle.'
