review:
  strengths:
  - Adaptive text color using alt.when() conditional encoding — white on dark cells,
    dark on light cells — excellent readability
  - Highlight borders on strong correlations (|r| >= 0.7) via transform_filter create
    clear visual hierarchy
  - Realistic weather correlation data with plausible injected relationships showing
    variety of positive and negative correlations
  - Clean layered composition (heatmap + highlight + text) is idiomatic Altair
  - White cell separators with corner radius give a polished, modern appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Output dimensions (~2800x2920 at scale_factor=4.0) don't match either target format
    (4800x2700 landscape or 3600x3600 square) — should use width/height that scales
    to a target size
  - Axis titles set to None — while acceptable for a correlation matrix, adding 'Weather
    Variable' or similar would improve self-documentation
  - Column label angle of -35 degrees gets tight with longer variable names — a steeper
    angle or top-padding adjustment would help
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x8 correlation heatmap of weather variables
    (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Visibility, Cloud Cover, Precipitation,
    UV Index). The color scheme is a blue-orange diverging palette centered at zero:
    strong positive correlations appear in dark orange/brown, strong negative correlations
    in dark blue, and near-zero values in light cream/white. Each cell contains a
    bold numeric annotation showing the Pearson correlation coefficient to two decimal
    places. Text color adapts — white on strongly colored cells, dark gray on lighter
    cells. Cells with |r| >= 0.7 have darker highlighted borders. Column labels are
    rotated at -35 degrees along the top axis, row labels are on the left. A vertical
    "Correlation" colorbar legend is positioned on the right. The title reads "heatmap-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients
    for 8 weather metrics." The layout is clean with white cell separators and rounded
    corners.'
