review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Highcharts interactive features: zoom/pan, tooltips, reset button,
    hover highlighting'
  - Clean blue sequential colormap that is colorblind-safe
  - Realistic website traffic data with clear weekday/weekend and day/night patterns
  - Well-structured code with proper inline JS embedding for Selenium screenshot
  - Good cell sizing with white borders for clear separation
  weaknesses:
  - Title format has descriptive prefix before the spec-id format
  - Legend title lacks units (e.g., Visitors count)
  - Could utilize Highcharts boost module more effectively for performance demonstration
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive heatmap showing website traffic
    data by hour of day (x-axis, 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:00) and day (y-axis, 20
    days spanning Monday through Week 3 Sat). The heatmap uses a blue sequential color
    scale ranging from very light blue/white (low values ~0) to dark navy blue (high
    values ~2250 visitors). The title reads "Website Traffic by Hour · heatmap-interactive
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining zoom/pan controls. A vertical
    color legend labeled "Visitors" appears on the right side. Clear patterns show
    higher traffic during business hours (9-17) on weekdays and lower traffic overnight
    and on weekends. X-axis labels are rotated at 315 degrees for readability. White
    borders separate each cell.
