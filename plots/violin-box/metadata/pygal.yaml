review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Gaussian kernel with Silverman's rule
    for bandwidth selection
  - Creative approach using XY chart to draw custom violin shapes since pygal lacks
    native violin support
  - Good visual distinction between categories with colorblind-safe palette
  - 'Complete box plot components: median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers all present'
  - Proper legend entries distinguish between categories and statistical components
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range extends to 140 despite data being clipped to 0-100, wasting vertical
    space
  - Legend mixes category names with box plot element names, creating visual complexity
