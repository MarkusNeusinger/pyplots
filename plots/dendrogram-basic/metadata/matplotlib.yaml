review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical clustering visualization with clear species separation
    (Setosa clearly distinct from Versicolor/Virginica)
  - Perfect use of scipy.cluster.hierarchy with Ward's method for meaningful distance
    metric
  - Color-coded clusters make the hierarchical relationships immediately apparent
  - Clean, professional styling with removed top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Realistic iris dataset context that is widely recognized in data science
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage any distinctive matplotlib visualization features beyond basic
    figure/axes setup
  - Y-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., Ward Linkage Distance or include
    clustering interpretation hints)
