review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using HorizontalStackedBar to simulate heatmap cells with individual
    coloring
  - Colorblind-friendly blue-to-orange color scheme with 10 discrete levels
  - Comprehensive interactive HTML version with zoom, pan, and reset controls
  - Realistic website engagement data scenario with visible patterns (clusters, hot/cold
    spots)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Static PNG output lacks colorbar legend - users cannot interpret color-to-value
    mapping without the HTML version
  - Y-axis labels use dashed leader lines which reduce visual clarity at this resolution
  - The stacked bar approach creates thin gaps between cells, reducing the cohesive
    grid appearance of a traditional heatmap
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 20x20 heatmap representing website page
    engagement by user segment. The visualization uses a horizontal stacked bar approach
    to simulate a heatmap, with rows labeled "Page 1" through "Page 20" on the Y-axis
    and "User Segment" numbers (0-20) on the X-axis. Colors range from dark blue (low
    engagement, ~2-10) through lighter blues, then pale blue/white transition, to
    yellow and orange (high engagement, ~90-98). The title "heatmap-interactive ·
    pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Clear clustering patterns are visible:
    high-engagement orange/yellow clusters around Pages 11-14 with Segments 12-17,
    Pages 3-5 with Segments 4-7, and Pages 16-18 with Segments 1-4. Hot spots (dark
    orange) appear at corners and specific cells. The colorbar is NOT visible in the
    static PNG - it only appears in the HTML version.'
