review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh Whisker model with TeeHead for professional error bar caps
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business data scenario with appropriate variation
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars annotation appears partially cut off at right edge
  - Only symmetric error bars shown; spec mentions asymmetric errors as a feature
  - Grid alpha could be more subtle
