review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex visualization with both row and column dendrograms
  - Proper hierarchical clustering using scipy with Ward's method and Euclidean distance
    as specified
  - Clean diverging colormap centered at zero for expression data
  - Good use of Altair's compositional operators (hconcat, vconcat) to create the
    multi-chart layout
  - Tooltips added for interactivity showing gene, sample, and expression values
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar legend could benefit from more prominent formatting
  - The dendrogram line thickness could be slightly reduced for visual elegance
  - Missing interactive zoom/pan features that Altair supports
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a clustered heatmap showing gene expression data for 20 genes across 15 samples. The visualization features:
    - **Title**: "heatmap-clustered · altair · pyplots.ai" centered at the top in large black text
    - **Dendrograms**: Row dendrogram on the left showing hierarchical clustering of genes, column dendrogram at the top showing clustering of samples - both rendered as dark gray lines
    - **Heatmap**: 20×15 grid of colored rectangles representing expression values
    - **Color scheme**: Diverging red-blue colormap (red = high expression ~6, white = near zero, blue = low expression ~-4)
    - **Colorbar**: Vertical legend on the right labeled "Expression" with values from -4 to 6
    - **Axis labels**: "Genes" on y-axis, "Samples" on x-axis, both with appropriate font sizes
    - **Gene labels**: Gene_01 through Gene_20 (reordered by clustering) on y-axis
    - **Sample labels**: Sample_01 through Sample_15 (reordered by clustering) on x-axis, displayed at -45° angle
    - **Visible clusters**: Clear expression patterns visible - Gene clusters (01-05, 10-15) showing high expression in certain sample groups

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding and mark_rect for heatmap, mark_rule
          for dendrograms, hconcat/vconcat for layout composition, but doesn't leverage
          interactivity beyond tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
