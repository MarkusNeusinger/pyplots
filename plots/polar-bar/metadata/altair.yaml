review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of mark_arc for creating polar bar chart wedges with proper theta/theta2
    angle calculations
  - Clean direction label positioning using calculated x/y coordinates from polar
    coordinates
  - Effective color encoding with sequential blues scheme that enhances data interpretation
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional data exploration capability
  - Realistic wind frequency data with prevailing westerlies pattern demonstrates
    domain knowledge
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title shows Frequency (days) but the scale numbers do not include units
    in tick labels
  - Scale factor 4.5 produces approximately 4050x4050 pixels which does not match
    the standard 3600x3600 or 4800x2700 target sizes
  - Could demonstrate stacked bars for wind speed ranges as mentioned in spec notes
  image_description: The plot displays a polar bar chart (wind rose) with 8 wedge-shaped
    bars radiating from a central point. Each bar represents a compass direction (N,
    NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) with direction labels positioned around the perimeter
    in dark blue (#306998). The bars use a sequential blue color scheme from light
    blue (low frequency ~6-8) to dark blue (high frequency ~20-22). The W (West) direction
    has the longest/darkest bar indicating highest frequency, followed by SW and NW,
    showing prevailing westerlies pattern. The title "polar-bar · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in dark gray. A legend on the right shows "Frequency"
    with a gradient scale from approximately 8 to 22. Bars have white stroke separators.
    The chart uses a square aspect ratio (900x900) and fills the canvas well.

        comment: Uses mark_arc effectively for polar bars, includes tooltips and interactive()
          for interactivity, but could leverage more Altair features like selections
          or layered annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
