review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of EMA indicator chart with all required features
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate line weights differentiating
    price from EMAs
  - Crossover points are highlighted with green dots, adding valuable trading signal
    visualization
  - Proper use of long-format data structure which is idiomatic for plotnine/ggplot2
  - Well-chosen colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Code is clean, reproducible, and follows KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are either missing or too subtle to be visible, making it harder to
    read exact values
  - Limited use of plotnine-specific features; implementation could leverage more
    grammar of graphics capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicator
    chart with 120 trading days of synthetic stock price data spanning from January
    2024 to June 2024. Three lines are visible: a blue "Close Price" line (thickest,
    most volatile), a red "EMA-12" line (medium thickness, smoother), and a yellow
    "EMA-26" line (medium thickness, smoothest). Green dots mark 6 crossover points
    where the EMA-12 crosses the EMA-26 line. The title "indicator-ema · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from ~125 to ~163, and the X-axis shows "Date" with monthly labels (Jan 2024 through
    Jun 2024) rotated 45 degrees. A legend box on the right shows the three series.
    The plot uses a minimal theme with light gray grid lines and a clean white background.'
