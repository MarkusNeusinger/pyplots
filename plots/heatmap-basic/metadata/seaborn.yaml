  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.clustermap — a distinctive seaborn feature that integrates
    hierarchical clustering with heatmap visualization
  - Intentional data patterns (Sales first-half, Engineering second-half, Finance
    stability, HR mid-year dip) create genuine visual storytelling
  - 'Strong visual refinement: custom colorbar positioning, spine removal, #fafafa
    background, white cell borders, and styled dendrogram'
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for the output resolution
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Coolwarm colormap could be replaced with a more colorblind-friendly diverging
    palette (e.g., RdBu or a custom perceptually-uniform option)
  - The Department axis label appears on the far right due to clustermap layout, slightly
    detached from the row labels
  - Data patterns could be slightly more varied — an additional extreme outlier or
    department with a sharp trend reversal would better demonstrate the heatmap full
    potential
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered heatmap showing monthly performance
    scores (0-100) across 7 departments (Sales, Finance, Engineering, Operations,
    Marketing, Support, HR). A coolwarm diverging colormap is used, centered at 50
    — red cells indicate high performance, blue cells low performance. Each cell contains
    a white numeric annotation showing the exact score. A row dendrogram on the left
    groups departments by similarity via hierarchical clustering (columns are not
    clustered). The colorbar on the far left is labeled "Performance Score" with ticks
    at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100. Axis labels read "Month" (x-axis) and "Department" (y-axis,
    on right side). The title "heatmap-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The background is a subtle off-white (#fafafa), cells are separated by white
    gridlines, and spines are removed for a clean look. Clear patterns are visible:
    Sales is strong in the first half, Engineering ramps up in the second half, Finance
    is consistently high (80-91), and HR shows a mid-year dip.'
