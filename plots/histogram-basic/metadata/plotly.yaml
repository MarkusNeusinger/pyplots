review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three labeled population clusters and percentage
    breakdowns — immediately communicates the distribution's story
  - Multimodal data generation with three realistic student groups creates a compelling,
    feature-rich histogram
  - 'Clean visual refinement: subtle dotted gridlines, custom background, white bar
    edge lines, well-positioned annotations with styled boxes'
  - HTML-formatted annotations and hovertemplate leverage Plotly-specific capabilities
    effectively
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: correct bin sizing, no gaps, zero-based y-axis, descriptive
    labels with units'
  weaknesses:
  - Mean/median reference lines use red vs green color distinction — problematic for
    red-green colorblind users. Consider using blue/orange or varying line width more
    dramatically in addition to dash patterns.
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of student exam scores on a light
    gray background (#f8f9fc) with steel-blue bars (rgba(48,105,152,0.85)). The x-axis
    is labeled "Score (points)" ranging from 30 to ~105, and the y-axis is labeled
    "Frequency (count)" ranging from 0 to ~45. Bars have no gaps and subtle white
    edge lines. The distribution is clearly multimodal: a dominant peak around 70-75
    (reaching ~44 count), a secondary peak near 85-90 (~26 count), and a small cluster
    around 40-45 (~6 count). Two vertical reference lines appear near score 73-74:
    a red dashed line for Median (73.8) and a green dotted line for Mean (72.9), though
    they overlap significantly. A legend box in the upper-left shows both values.
    Three annotation callouts with arrows identify the clusters: "Main cluster — 77%
    of students" at the peak, "High achievers — 17% of students" on the right, and
    "Struggling — 6% of students" on the left. The title "histogram-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Y-axis has subtle dotted gridlines; x-axis
    has no grid. Overall a clean, well-organized, publication-quality histogram.'
