review:
  strengths:
  - Effective data storytelling with Top seller annotation arrow highlighting the
    leading category
  - Strong visual hierarchy through three-shade blue differentiation (dark=leader,
    standard=middle, light=lowest)
  - 'Professional polish: off-white background, white bar edges, subtle grid, triple
    spine removal, weighted bottom spine'
  - Dollar-formatted value labels and y-axis ticks for immediate readability
  - Perfect spec compliance with all requested features implemented
  weaknesses:
  - The dollar_fmt function definition violates the KISS no functions/classes rule
    — replace with a lambda or inline format string
  - Y-axis upper limit (max*1.12) creates noticeable dead space above the tallest
    bar, reducing canvas utilization
  - The data storytelling could be more complete — only the top seller is annotated,
    leaving the bottom performer (Books) with just a color change but no callout
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" showing product sales across 6 categories: Electronics ($45,200),
    Clothing ($32,800), Home & Garden ($28,500), Sports ($38,700), Books ($18,900),
    and Toys ($24,100). All bars use a blue color scheme — the top seller (Electronics)
    is highlighted in a darker navy blue (#1A4971) with an annotation arrow reading
    "Top seller Electronics", while the lowest performer (Books) is in a lighter/muted
    blue (#7BA7C9). The remaining four bars use the standard Python Blue (#306998).
    Dollar-formatted value labels appear above each bar. The y-axis is labeled "Sales
    (USD)" with dollar-formatted ticks, and the x-axis is labeled "Product Category".
    The background is off-white (#FAFAFA), y-axis grid lines are subtle (alpha=0.15),
    and top/right/left spines are removed leaving only a weighted bottom spine.'
