review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of distribution shapes with the bimodal Sales distribution
    clearly visible
  - Proper implementation of quartile markers (IQR line) and median points inside
    violins
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax with transform_density and layering
  - Realistic salary data scenario with meaningful variation between departments
  - Correct title format and well-sized text elements
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines on the plot to aid value reading
  - Color alternating pattern (2 colors for 4 categories) does not add meaningful
    category distinction
  - Could benefit from adding tooltips for interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots showing salary distributions
    by department (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). The violins are colored
    in a blue-yellow alternating pattern (#306998 blue for Engineering and Sales,
    #FFD43B yellow for Marketing and Support). Each violin shows the kernel density
    estimation shape of the salary distribution. Inside each violin, there is a black
    vertical line representing the interquartile range (IQR) and a white dot with
    black border marking the median. The y-axis shows "Salary ($)" ranging from 10,000
    to 140,000. Department names appear below each violin. The title "violin-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The Sales violin clearly shows
    a bimodal distribution (two bulges). All text is clearly readable with appropriate
    font sizes.'
