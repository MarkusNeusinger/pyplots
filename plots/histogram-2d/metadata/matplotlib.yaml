review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density representation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate bin count (40) balances resolution and noise for 5000 data points
  - cmin=1 effectively hides empty bins, improving visual clarity
  - Proper font sizing throughout (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Colorbar well-positioned and labeled
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual or domain-specific
  - Missing grid (though acceptable for heatmaps, a subtle grid could help read values)
  - Could showcase more matplotlib-specific features like hexbin alternative or marginal
    histograms
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D histogram heatmap showing a bivariate
    normal distribution with positive correlation. The viridis colormap ranges from
    dark purple (low counts ~5) through teal/green to bright yellow (high counts ~45).
    The data forms a clear elliptical pattern oriented diagonally from bottom-left
    to top-right, centered around (0,0), demonstrating the 0.7 correlation coefficient.
    A vertical colorbar on the right indicates "Count" with well-sized tick labels.
    The title follows the correct format "histogram-2d · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    Axis labels show "X Value" and "Y Value". Empty bins appear as white/transparent,
    making the density pattern clearly visible.
