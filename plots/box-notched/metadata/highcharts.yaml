review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent clinical trial context with dose-response relationship clearly visible
  - Creative use of error bars to represent notch confidence intervals
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette
  - Proper outlier visualization as separate scatter series
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Informative subtitle explaining the 95% CI notation
  weaknesses:
  - Notches represented as error bars rather than actual notched box shape (Highcharts
    limitation, acceptable workaround)
  - Legend text slightly small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas
