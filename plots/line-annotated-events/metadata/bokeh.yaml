review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features (vertical lines, event labels,
    distinct styling)
  - Clean alternating height pattern for event labels prevents text overlap
  - Good color scheme with Python blue and yellow that is colorblind-safe
  - Realistic tech product scenario with meaningful event labels
  - Proper use of Bokeh Span and Label models for annotations
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) showcases Bokeh capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Event labels at 16pt are slightly small compared to other text elements at 4800x2700
    canvas size
  - Legend is positioned far from the data in bottom-right corner
  - HTML output could leverage Bokeh hover tools for enhanced interactivity
