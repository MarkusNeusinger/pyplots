review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud metaphor with cloud above, boxplot in
    middle, rain below
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B demonstrates the power of raincloud plots
    to reveal hidden patterns
  - 'Good use of Bokeh interactivity: HoverTool shows group statistics, legend items
    can be clicked to hide/show'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Manual KDE calculation using Silverman's rule shows attention to statistical accuracy
  - Clean horizontal layout with proper spacing between groups
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears to have visual artifacts/duplication in the top-right corner area
  - Scatter point size (12) could be slightly larger for better visibility at 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Box plot height (0.08) is quite thin relative to the cloud and rain elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud visualization with
    four treatment groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) arranged
    vertically. Each group shows three components: a half-violin/KDE "cloud" above
    the centerline in distinct colors (blue for Control, yellow for Treatment A, green
    for Treatment B, coral/orange for Treatment C), a white boxplot with black outlines
    at the center showing median and quartiles, and jittered scatter points ("rain")
    below the centerline. The x-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from ~200-600ms,
    and the y-axis shows "Treatment Group". The title reads "raincloud-basic · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right identifies each treatment group. Treatment
    B notably shows a bimodal distribution in its cloud shape. Grid lines are subtle
    with dashed styling.'

          legend with click_policy="hide", but could leverage more Bokeh-specific
          features like linked brushing
  verdict: APPROVED
