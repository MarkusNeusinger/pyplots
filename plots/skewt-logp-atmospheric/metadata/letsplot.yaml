review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Skew-T Log-P diagram with proper skewing of isotherms
  - Physically accurate atmospheric thermodynamics (dry adiabats, moist adiabats calculated
    correctly)
  - Good color differentiation between all line types
  - Clean visual presentation with appropriate line weights
  - Proper logarithmic and inverted pressure axis
  weaknesses:
  - Legend uses Unicode characters that may not render consistently and do not accurately
    represent the actual line styles in the plot
  - Minor visual overlap between the legend text and data/reference lines in the right
    portion of the chart
  - Some imports could be cleaner (theme_minimal imported but grid is then disabled)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with pressure
    (hPa) on the y-axis (inverted logarithmic scale from 1000 at bottom to 100 at
    top) and skewed temperature (°C) on the x-axis. The temperature profile is shown
    as a solid red line with red circular markers, while the dewpoint profile is displayed
    as a dashed blue line with blue circular markers. Both profiles span from surface
    (1000 hPa) to upper troposphere (100 hPa). Reference lines include: gray isotherms
    (skewed ~45 degrees), orange dashed dry adiabats curving from lower-right to upper-left,
    purple dash-dot moist adiabats, and green dotted mixing ratio lines. A manual
    legend is positioned on the right side of the plot showing all five line types
    with their corresponding colors and line styles. The title follows the correct
    format. The overall layout is clean with good use of the canvas area.'

          good use of lets-plot features but does not leverage interactive capabilities
