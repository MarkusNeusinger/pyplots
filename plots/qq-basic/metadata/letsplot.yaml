review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of the inverse normal CDF (ppf) using Abramowitz
    & Stegun approximation, avoiding scipy dependency
  - Correct use of Blom formula for plotting positions, which is statistically appropriate
  - Good demonstration of Q-Q plot interpretation with intentionally skewed data showing
    deviation from normality
  - Proper scaling (3x scale factor) to achieve target 4800×2700 resolution
  - 'Clean visual design with Python brand colors (blue #306998, gold #FFD43B) and
    minimal theme'
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (current alpha appears around 0.5, could
    be 0.3)
  - Wildcard import from lets_plot requires multiple noqa comments
  image_description: The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot comparing sample
    data against a theoretical normal distribution. Blue points (#306998, Python blue)
    represent the quantile pairs, plotted against a yellow dashed reference line (#FFD43B,
    Python gold) indicating the y=x line for perfect normality. The X-axis is labeled
    "Theoretical Quantiles" and the Y-axis "Sample Quantiles", both ranging from approximately
    -3 to 3. The title correctly shows "qq-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The plot
    clearly demonstrates right skewness in the data - points follow the reference
    line closely in the lower/middle region but deviate upward above the line in the
    upper quantiles (above ~0.5 theoretical quantiles), indicating the sample has
    heavier right tail than a normal distribution. The visualization uses a minimal
    theme with subtle gray dashed grid lines on a white background.

        comment: ggplot() + geom_point/geom_line with theme_minimal; good use of ggsize
          for scaling. Manual ppf calculation is thorough but could potentially use
          scipy for cleaner code if available.
  verdict: APPROVED
