review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice using seaborn colorblind palette
  - Clear flow visualization with well-proportioned ribbons (alpha=0.55 works well)
  - Smart label placement strategy (left/right alternating) avoids most overlaps
  - Titanic-style data is a perfect educational example for parallel categories
  - Professional styling with sns.set_context(talk) for readable fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib patches rather than seaborn native plotting functions
    (seaborn lacks native parallel categories support so this is acceptable but limits
    LF score)
  - The survival probability calculation loop adds code complexity that could be simplified
    with vectorized operations
