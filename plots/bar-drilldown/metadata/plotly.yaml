review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly animation frames to demonstrate drilldown levels
  - Clean, professional visual design with consistent color scheme
  - Comprehensive hierarchical data structure (3 levels deep)
  - Good use of hover tooltips showing drillable status
  - Proper HTML export with interactive controls
  - Value labels formatted clearly with currency notation
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (get_children, get_breadcrumb_path) instead of inline KISS
    structure
  - Drilldown is via dropdown menu rather than clicking bars directly (spec says click
    on column)
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (alpha 0.1 is very faint)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a column/bar chart showing "Revenue by Regions"
    with four blue bars representing North America ($450M), Europe ($380M), Asia Pacific
    ($320M), and Latin America ($150M). The bars are rendered in a consistent Python
    blue color (#306998) with darker edge outlines. Value labels appear above each
    bar in "$XXM" format. The title follows the required format "bar-drilldown · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing the current path "Revenue by Regions | Path:
    All Regions". A dropdown menu labeled "All Regions" appears in the top-left corner
    for navigation between hierarchy levels. An instruction annotation at the bottom
    reads "Click a bar to drill down | Click breadcrumb to go back". The background
    is white with subtle horizontal gridlines. The layout is clean with good spacing
    between bars and appropriate margins.'
