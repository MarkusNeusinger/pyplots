review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of manual KDE calculation using Silverman's rule for
    bandwidth selection
  - Beautiful color gradient that semantically represents temperature (cold=blue,
    warm=yellow/orange)
  - Clean chronological ordering with January at bottom, December at top (reversed
    for visual stacking)
  - Proper use of Plotly's fill="toself" for creating solid density regions
  - Custom hover templates provide good interactivity showing month and temperature
  - Well-tuned overlap parameter (50%) matches spec recommendation
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining the color scale (cold→warm color mapping)
  - HTML output is generated but not strictly required for review
