review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the classic volcano plot pattern with clear visual
    separation of significance categories
  - Proper threshold annotations (p=0.05, FC=2, FC=0.5) provide context for the significance
    cutoffs
  - Clean data generation with realistic bimodal distribution for differentially expressed
    genes
  - Good use of seaborn hue parameter with custom palette matching the specification
    colors
  - Sorting mechanism ensures significant points are plotted on top and remain visible
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (consider using blue-orange instead
    of blue-red)
  - Missing optional gene labels for top significant features mentioned in the spec
    notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a volcano plot with 500 data points representing
    simulated differential gene expression data. The x-axis shows "Log2 Fold Change"
    ranging from approximately -3.5 to 4.5, and the y-axis shows "-Log10(p-value)"
    ranging from 0 to about 7. Three categories of points are shown: gray points for
    "Not Significant" genes clustered around the center with low p-values, blue points
    for "Down-regulated" genes on the left side (negative fold change, high significance),
    and red/coral points for "Up-regulated" genes on the right side (positive fold
    change, high significance). Horizontal dashed threshold line at p=0.05 (y≈1.3)
    and vertical dashed lines at FC=0.5 and FC=2 (log2FC=±1) are clearly visible.
    The legend is positioned in the upper right corner. The title follows the correct
    format: "volcano-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Good use of seaborn's hue and palette features, but doesn't leverage
          more advanced seaborn features like FacetGrid or statistical annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
