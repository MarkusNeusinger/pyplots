review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Mean reference lines add valuable statistical context as suggested in spec notes
  - Appropriate jitter width (0.2) prevents overplotting while keeping points within
    category bounds
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for the data density (~50 points per group)
  - Custom hover template provides clean information display
  weaknesses:
  - Uses only 2 colors alternating across 4 groups, reducing visual distinction between
    categories
  - Legend is redundant with x-axis labels; could be removed or replaced with mean
    value annotations
  - Does not use plotly.express px.strip() which would provide native strip plot functionality
    with automatic jitter
  image_description: The plot displays a strip plot with four categories (Group A,
    Group B, Group C, Group D) on the x-axis and "Response Score" on the y-axis ranging
    from approximately 30 to 110. Each group shows individual data points with horizontal
    jitter applied. Groups A and C use blue color (#306998), while Groups B and D
    use yellow (#FFD43B). Black horizontal lines indicate the mean for each group.
    The title "strip-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend
    on the right side identifies each group. The background uses the plotly_white
    template with subtle horizontal grid lines.

        comment: Blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) have good contrast, but using
          only 2 colors for 4 groups reduces distinction between alternating groups

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1), legend is well-placed; however, legend
          duplicates x-axis labels which is redundant

        comment: Implementation uses go.Scatter with manual jitter instead of leveraging
          plotly.express's built-in strip plot (px.strip) which handles jitter automatically
          and provides better hover interactions
  verdict: APPROVED
