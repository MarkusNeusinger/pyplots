review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme with consistent branch coloring (children
    visually relate to parents)
  - Smart label placement logic that only shows labels for sufficiently large segments
    (>15° for level 2, >12° for level 3)
  - Clean white edge separators (linewidth=2.5) provide clear visual hierarchy distinction
  - Square aspect ratio (12x12) is perfect choice for radial visualization
  - Real-world budget scenario with meaningful department/team/project hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed or explicit reproducibility comment (deterministic data mitigates
    this)
  - Could use more extreme value variation between segments to better demonstrate
    proportional sizing
  - White label color on inner ring may reduce contrast on lighter portions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sunburst chart with three concentric rings
    showing a company budget breakdown. The innermost ring shows three departments:
    Engineering (blue, #306998), Sales (yellow, #FFD43B), and Marketing (olive/gold).
    The middle ring displays teams: Frontend, Backend, DevOps under Engineering; North,
    South under Sales; Digital, Brand under Marketing. The outer ring shows individual
    projects like Web App, Mobile, API, Database, Cloud, CI/CD, Enterprise, SMB, SEO,
    Ads, Events, and Content. The chart uses Python branding colors as the base palette
    with lighter variations for child levels. The title "Company Budget · sunburst-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The chart fills the square canvas
    well with proper spacing and white edge separators between segments.'

        comment: Uses pie() with wedgeprops for ring widths which is matplotlib's
          approach to sunburst, but this is not a specialized sunburst function; it's
          a manual construction using nested pie charts
  verdict: APPROVED
