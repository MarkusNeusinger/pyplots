review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast implementation using conditional color encoding for annotations
  - Professional diverging colormap (blueorange) appropriate for correlation data
  - Well-structured data generation creating realistic business metric correlations
  - Clean layered approach combining heatmap rectangles with text overlay
  - High-quality formatting with proper number formatting (.2f for correlations)
  weaknesses:
  - Limited demonstration of negative correlations (only -0.24 appears)
  - Axis label "Variable" is generic; could be more descriptive given the business
    context
  - Does not utilize Altair interactive features (tooltips) in the HTML output
  - Canvas utilization could be improved with slightly larger margins
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 7×7 annotated correlation heatmap showing
    relationships between business metrics: Sales, Marketing, R&D, Support, Revenue,
    Growth, and Profit. The visualization uses a blue-orange diverging colormap (blueorange
    scheme) with the scale ranging from -1 to 1. Each cell contains its correlation
    coefficient formatted to 2 decimal places. The diagonal shows perfect correlations
    (1.00) in dark orange. Strong positive correlations appear in orange/brown (e.g.,
    Sales-Revenue: 0.86, R&D-Growth: 0.87, Revenue-Profit: 0.87), while the only negative
    correlation visible is Support-Profit at -0.24 in light blue. Text annotations
    use white color on dark backgrounds (|correlation| > 0.5) and black on light backgrounds
    for optimal contrast. The title "heatmap-annotated · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. A vertical colorbar legend on the right shows the correlation scale.
    The chart is square with equal-sized cells separated by white borders.'
