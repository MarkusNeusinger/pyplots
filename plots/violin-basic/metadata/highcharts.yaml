review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent distribution variety demonstrating violin plot capabilities (normal,
    bimodal, skewed)
  - Clear colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Proper use of Highcharts PolygonSeries to create violin shapes with KDE
  - Includes median markers and IQR boxes as spec requires
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate data ranges
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Clean separation of violin shapes with no overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning at bottom overlaps slightly with x-axis title - could be better
    placed
  - The IQR boxes are very thin (box_width=0.05) and could be slightly wider for better
    visibility
  - Grid lines could be even more subtle (currently alpha=0.15, could use 0.1)
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes representing Study Groups
    A, B, C, and D on a white background. Each violin uses a distinct colorblind-safe
    color: blue (#306998) for Group A, yellow (#FFD43B) for Group B, purple (#9467BD)
    for Group C, and cyan (#17BECF) for Group D. Each violin features a centered black
    IQR (interquartile range) box and a red diamond marker indicating the median.
    The title "violin-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold.
    The Y-axis labeled "Test Score (points)" ranges from 0-130, and the X-axis labeled
    "Study Group" shows the four category labels. A legend at the bottom identifies
    each group color and the median marker. The violins effectively demonstrate different
    distribution shapes: Group A shows a symmetric normal distribution, Group B displays
    clear bimodality with two bulges, Group C is normally distributed, and Group D
    exhibits right-skewed exponential distribution with a long upper tail reaching
    ~120.'

          complex than strictly necessary due to manual polygon construction for violins.
