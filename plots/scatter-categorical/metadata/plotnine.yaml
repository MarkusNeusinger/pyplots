review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all labels clearly readable at target resolution
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation with proper layer composition
  - Smart use of three distinct data patterns (correlation, high values, scattered)
    demonstrating categorical differences
  - Colorblind-safe palette choice with good contrast between categories
  - Realistic biological scenario (plant species growth vs temperature)
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like facet_wrap for small multiples
    or stat_smooth for trend lines
  - Legend title font size could be slightly larger for consistency with axis titles
  image_description: 'The plot shows a categorical scatter plot with 120 data points
    (40 per group) representing plant growth rates vs. temperature for three species.
    Colors used are: **blue (#306998)** for Species A, **yellow (#FFD43B)** for Species
    B, and **cyan (#4ECDC4)** for Species C. The plot has a clean white background
    with subtle gray grid lines. The title "scatter-categorical · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is at the top center. The x-axis is labeled "Temperature (°C)" ranging from about
    10-70, and the y-axis is labeled "Growth Rate (cm/week)" ranging from about 15-65.
    A legend on the right side maps colors to "Plant Species" categories. The three
    species show different patterns: Species A (blue) clusters in lower temperature/lower
    growth range with positive correlation, Species B (yellow) occupies higher temperature/mid-high
    growth values, and Species C (cyan) is scattered in the middle temperature range
    with high variability. Points have appropriate alpha transparency for visibility.'

        comment: Uses basic plotnine features (ggplot + geom_point + scale_color_manual
          + theme). Could use plotnine-specific features like faceting, stat layers,
          or position adjustments for bonus points
  verdict: APPROVED
