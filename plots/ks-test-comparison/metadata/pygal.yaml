review:
  strengths:
  - Correct statistical computation using scipy ks_2samp with proper ECDF construction
    on a combined grid
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario that perfectly fits the KS test use case
  - Clean readable code structure with appropriate random seed
  - Font sizes explicitly configured for 4800x2700 canvas - all text is clearly legible
  - Good canvas utilization with legend at bottom
  weaknesses:
  - KS statistic and p-value are only shown in the legend entry not as a prominent
    on-plot annotation - spec says to show these prominently
  - The KS line color (#D4380D) is nearly indistinguishable from Bad Customers (#E8590C)
    - use a contrasting color like green or black
  - ECDF line strokes are thin for the canvas size - increase stroke_width to 6-8
    for better visibility
  - The vertical KS line needs more visual weight (thicker bolder color) to serve
    as the focal point of the visualization
  - Manual step-function loop construction is verbose - consider simplifying with
    numpy operations
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) on a white background at 4800x2700 resolution. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" in dark gray at the top. Two step-function curves are drawn:
    a blue line for "Good Customers" (centered around 650 credit score) and an orange/red
    line for "Bad Customers" (centered around 500 credit score). A vertical dashed
    line at approximately x=575 connects two red dots, representing the point of maximum
    divergence between the ECDFs — the KS statistic. The X-axis is labeled "Credit
    Score" (ranging ~250-950), and the Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" (0-1).
    The legend at the bottom shows three entries: "Good Customers" (blue), "Bad Customers"
    (orange), and "KS = 0.657, p = 1.93e-61" (dark red). Grid lines are present in
    light gray. The ECDF lines are thin (~4px stroke) and appear smooth due to 300
    data points per sample. The KS line color (#D4380D) is very similar to the Bad
    Customers color (#E8590C), making them hard to distinguish visually.'
