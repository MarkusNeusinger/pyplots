review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 3D projection in a 2D library using painter's algorithm
    for depth sorting
  - Clean contour line generation using contourpy with proper projection to 3D space
  - Good visual appearance with Viridis colormap and well-designed custom axes with
    arrows
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels appear truncated in the rendered output—descriptive labels in code
    show as single letters in image
  - Base plane contour projections are too faint (alpha=0.4 with dashed lines makes
    them nearly invisible)
  - Title font size could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive callback features that would make the visualization
    more distinctive
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D contour surface using isometric projection
    in Bokeh. A colored surface with two distinct Gaussian peaks is rendered—a primary
    peak near the center and a secondary smaller peak offset to the upper right. The
    surface is colored using the Viridis colormap, transitioning from deep purple
    (low values ~0.2) through teal/green to bright yellow (high values ~1.0). Dark
    contour lines are drawn directly on the surface at regular intervals, showing
    level curves. Three custom axis arrows (X, Y, Z) with labels are positioned at
    the bottom-left corner of the visualization. A vertical colorbar on the right
    side shows the "Height (Z)" scale. The title "contour-3d · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top-left. The base plane shows faint dashed contour projections.
    The background is light gray with subtle grid lines.
