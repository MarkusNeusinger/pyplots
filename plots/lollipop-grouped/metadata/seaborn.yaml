review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized markers and stems
  - Proper grouped positioning with calculated offsets
  - Good colorblind-friendly color palette (Python Blue + accessible colors)
  - Clean KISS code structure with realistic business data scenario
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Implementation does not actually use seaborn library - only matplotlib functions
    are used (ax.plot, ax.scatter). This is a seaborn implementation file but seaborn
    is not imported.
  - 'Minor: legend title terminology inconsistency with spec'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across 4 regions (North, South, East, West). Each region
    has 3 lollipops representing Electronics (blue #306998), Clothing (yellow #FFD43B),
    and Food (red/coral #E24A33). The lollipops consist of thin vertical stems extending
    from a baseline of 0 up to circular markers at the top. The plot uses a 16:9 aspect
    ratio with clear axis labels - "Region" on x-axis and "Revenue (M$)" on y-axis
    with units. The title follows the correct format "lollipop-grouped · seaborn ·
    pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper right identifies each product line. A subtle
    horizontal grid (alpha 0.3, dashed) aids value reading. Values range from ~22
    to ~53 M$, showing Electronics consistently highest across regions.'
