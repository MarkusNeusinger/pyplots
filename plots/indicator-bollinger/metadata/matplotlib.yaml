review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Bollinger Bands with all required components (close
    price, SMA, upper/lower bands with fill)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good color scheme with colorblind-safe palette
  - Proper date handling with business day frequency
  - Title format matches specification exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position at upper left slightly overlaps with early data points - consider
    upper right or adjusting framealpha
  - Data shows mostly downtrend - could benefit from more varied price action (rally
    + decline + consolidation)
  image_description: The plot displays a Bollinger Bands indicator chart for stock
    price data spanning from January 2024 to June 2024. The closing price is shown
    as a dark blue/black solid line (linewidth ~2.5) that starts around $151, peaks
    briefly at ~$165 in late January, then trends downward to stabilize around $127-140.
    The 20-day SMA is rendered as a yellow dashed line (#FFD43B) serving as the middle
    band. The volatility envelope is displayed as a light blue semi-transparent filled
    region (#306998 at 20% alpha) between the upper and lower bands, with the band
    edges visible as darker blue solid lines. The title follows the required format
    "indicator-bollinger · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at fontsize 24. The legend is
    positioned in the upper left corner with good framealpha. Axis labels show "Date"
    on x-axis and "Price ($)" on y-axis with appropriate font sizes. A subtle dashed
    grid with alpha=0.3 provides reference without dominating.
