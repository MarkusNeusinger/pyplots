review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud structure with correct cloud-right, rain-left layout matching
    spec requirements
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B effectively demonstrates the advantage of
    rainclouds over boxplots
  - Colorblind-accessible palette with good contrast between conditions
  - Realistic experimental context with appropriate reaction time values
  - Clean, readable code with proper random seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Violin clipping approach uses direct vertex manipulation rather than seaborn-native
    methods
  - Legend overlaps slightly with data points in the upper left corner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a raincloud visualization comparing reaction
    times across three experimental conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B).
    Each condition is represented with a colorblind-accessible color scheme: blue
    (#306998) for Control, yellow/gold (#E6A800) for Treatment A, and green (#4DAF4A)
    for Treatment B. The raincloud structure is correctly implemented with half-violins
    (clouds) on the right side of each category, white boxplots with black borders
    in the middle showing median and quartiles, and jittered strip points (rain) on
    the left side. The title "raincloud-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top. The Y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from about 300-575ms,
    and the X-axis shows "Condition". The Treatment B distribution clearly shows bimodality
    in its half-violin, demonstrating the advantage of rainclouds over traditional
    boxplots. A legend is positioned in the upper left corner. Grid lines are subtle
    and dashed on the y-axis only.'
