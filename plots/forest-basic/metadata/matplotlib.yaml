review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of the forest plot with all key elements: effect sizes,
    confidence intervals, weighted markers, and pooled estimate diamond'
  - Professional visual design with appropriate color scheme (Python blue for studies,
    yellow for pooled)
  - Clear Favors Treatment/Control annotations enhance interpretability
  - Marker sizes proportional to study weights effectively communicate study importance
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend explaining that marker size represents study weight
  - All effect sizes favor treatment (none crossing the null line to favor control
    would make data more illustrative)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a forest plot for meta-analysis of 10 studies.
    Each study (Johnson 2018 through Taylor 2023) is shown on the y-axis with horizontal
    blue lines representing confidence intervals and blue circular markers of varying
    sizes (proportional to study weight) indicating point estimates. A vertical dashed
    gray reference line at x=0 marks the null effect. At the bottom, a yellow diamond
    shows the pooled estimate. The x-axis is labeled "Standardized Mean Difference
    (95% CI)" with annotations "← Favors Treatment" on the left and "Favors Control
    →" on the right. The title follows the required format: "forest-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai". Colors used are blue (#306998) for study markers/CIs and yellow
    (#FFD43B) for the pooled estimate diamond.'
