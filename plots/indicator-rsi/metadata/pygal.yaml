review:
  strengths:
  - Correct RSI calculation using EMA method with 14-period lookback
  - All three threshold lines (30, 50, 70) properly implemented with distinct colors
    and dashed styling
  - Clean, readable layout with proper axis labeling including lookback period info
  - Good use of pygal interpolation for smooth RSI line
  - Proper Y-axis range fixed at 0-100 as required
  weaknesses:
  - RSI data never enters overbought zone (>70), limiting demonstration of full indicator
    utility
  - Specification suggests shading overbought/oversold zones for visual clarity, which
    is not implemented
  - Legend at bottom with small box sizes could be more prominent
  - RSI line and threshold lines could be slightly thicker for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart on a white background. The title "indicator-rsi · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is shown at the top in a legible font. The Y-axis is labeled "RSI Value (0-100)"
    with a proper 0-100 scale. The X-axis is labeled "Trading Period (120 days, 14-period
    RSI lookback)". A blue RSI line oscillates across 120 periods, showing values
    ranging roughly from 25 to 65, with typical momentum indicator behavior. Three
    horizontal threshold lines are displayed: a green dashed line at 70 (overbought),
    a red dashed line at 30 (oversold), and a gray dashed line at 50 (centerline).
    The legend at the bottom clearly identifies all four series: RSI (14), Overbought
    (70), Oversold (30), and Centerline (50). The chart uses cubic interpolation for
    smooth lines and has subtle horizontal grid lines.'
