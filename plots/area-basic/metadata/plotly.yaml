  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic weekly traffic patterns and upward trend
    using sinusoidal component
  - Clean, professional visual design with well-chosen blue color from the pyplots
    palette
  - Peak annotation adds analytical value and showcases Plotly annotation capabilities
  - Proper font sizing throughout (28/22/18pt) following library guidelines exactly
  - Semi-transparent fill at 0.35 alpha balances readability and visual weight perfectly
  - Interactive HTML export with range slider demonstrates Plotly interactivity strengths
  weaknesses:
  - No legend displayed — even for a single series, a small legend would improve chart
    completeness
  - Only 30 data points is at the low end of the spec range; denser data would better
    showcase the area chart strengths
  - Library features underutilized — could leverage Plotly-specific features like
    fill gradient pattern, range selector buttons, or spike lines for the static output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    across January 2024. A smooth spline line in dark blue (#306998) traces the data
    with a semi-transparent blue fill (alpha ~0.35) extending down to the x-axis.
    The x-axis is labeled "Date (January 2024)" with weekly tick marks at Jan 07,
    Jan 14, Jan 21, and Jan 28. The y-axis is labeled "Visitors (daily count)" with
    comma-formatted ticks from 0 to 7,000+. The title "Daily Website Visitors · area-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A bordered annotation "Peak: 7,135"
    with an arrow points to the highest data point near Jan 29. The background uses
    plotly_white template with subtle gray gridlines. The data shows a clear weekly
    cyclical pattern (dips roughly every 7 days) with an overall upward trend. Layout
    is balanced with good margins and no overlapping elements.'

        comment: Uses hovertemplate and spline shape (Plotly-specific), but HTML export
          with range slider only applied after PNG save. Could better leverage Plotly
          features in static output.
  verdict: APPROVED
