review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the gains curve with all spec-required elements (model,
    baseline, perfect model)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) and colors
  - Informative annotation highlighting the key insight at 20% targeting threshold
  - Shaded area effectively communicates the model lift over random selection
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of matplotlib Axes methods throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in lower right overlaps with the data region where curves pass
    through
  - Square aspect ratio (1:1) while appropriate for the 0-100% axes creates some unused
    corner space compared to 16:9
