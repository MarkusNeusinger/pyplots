review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, error bars, color
    gradient, zero reference line'
  - 'Clean use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, linear_cmap, Whisker
    model'
  - Great choice of realistic housing price prediction context with 15 meaningful
    feature names
  - Proper sorting logic with highest importance at top
  - Good visual hierarchy with darker blues for more important features
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label lacks units (e.g., Mean Decrease in R² Score would be more informative)
  - Error bar caps (upper_head/lower_head) are set to None - small T-shaped caps would
    improve visibility
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show exact values
    on hover
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing permutation
    feature importance for a housing price prediction model. There are 15 features
    sorted by mean importance (highest at top): Square Footage, Number of Bedrooms,
    Neighborhood Score, etc. The bars use a blue sequential color gradient from Blues9
    palette (darker blue = higher importance, lighter blue = lower/negative importance).
    Each bar has horizontal error bars (whiskers) showing the standard deviation across
    permutation shuffles. A vertical dashed reference line at x=0 distinguishes positive
    from negative importance values. The bottom two features (Walk Score, Public Transit
    Access) have slightly negative importance values extending left of the zero line.
    The title "bar-permutation-importance · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    The x-axis is labeled "Mean Decrease in Model Score" and feature names are displayed
    on the y-axis.'

        comment: Good use of ColumnDataSource, linear_cmap transform, Whisker model
