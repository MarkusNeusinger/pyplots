review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with clear hierarchical structure
  - Excellent color-coded clusters that are colorblind-accessible
  - Good use of Plotly figure_factory for dendrogram creation
  - Realistic Iris flower dataset example that matches spec suggestion
  - Well-formatted title following pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate line width (3) for visibility at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain what the cluster colors represent
  - Unconventional inline lambda import for scipy linkage function
  - Could add hover information to display sample details interactively
  image_description: 'The plot displays a dendrogram (hierarchical clustering tree)
    with a clean white background. The title "dendrogram-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top in black text. The y-axis shows "Distance (Ward)" ranging
    from 0 to ~10, and the x-axis is labeled "Iris Flower Samples" with 15 sample
    names rotated at -45 degrees. The dendrogram uses three distinct colors to highlight
    clusters: green for Setosa samples (leftmost cluster), red/coral for Virginica
    samples (middle), and cyan/teal for Versicolor samples (rightmost). The tree structure
    clearly shows how samples merge at different distance levels, with the Setosa
    cluster being most distinct (joining the others at distance ~10), while Virginica
    and Versicolor clusters merge at distance ~4. Line widths are thick enough for
    good visibility.'
