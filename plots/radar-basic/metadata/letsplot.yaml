review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using polar-to-cartesian coordinate transformation
  - Clean construction of gridlines (concentric circles) and spoke lines
  - Perfect use of transparency (alpha=0.25) for overlapping polygons
  - Professional Python color scheme (blue and yellow)
  - Properly closes polygons by repeating the first point
  - Clear, readable category labels positioned at outer edge
  - Square format (1200x1200 with scale=3) appropriate for symmetric radar chart
  weaknesses:
  - Grid value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) appear inverted/upside-down on the vertical
    axis - they read from center outward but the visual suggests values increase toward
    center
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features (tooltips showing exact values)
    since HTML output is generated
  image_description: 'The plot shows a radar/spider chart comparing two employees
    (Alice and Bob) across 6 competency categories: Creativity, Leadership, Communication,
    Technical, Problem Solving, and Teamwork. Alice''s polygon is rendered in Python
    blue (#306998) with semi-transparent fill, while Bob''s is in Python yellow (#FFD43B).
    Both polygons have clear vertices marked with points and solid connecting lines.
    The chart features dashed concentric circular gridlines at intervals of 20, 40,
    60, 80, and 100, with radial spoke lines extending to each category axis. Category
    labels are positioned at the outer edge of each axis. Scale values (20-100) are
    displayed along the right side of the top spoke. A legend on the right side identifies
    the two employees. The title "radar-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears in
    the top-left corner.'

        comment: Shows comparison between two series with different strengths; Alice

          Could show more dramatic variation to demonstrate radar chart capabilities
          better

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar of graphics (geom_polygon, geom_line, geom_point,
          geom_text), manual color scales, and theme customization. Good use of lets-plot
          idioms but no advanced features like interactivity or tooltips that lets-plot
          offers.
  verdict: APPROVED
