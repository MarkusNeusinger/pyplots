review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom implementation extending pygal Graph class to create heatmap
    functionality not natively available
  - Clear visual hierarchy with readable text at all sizes
  - Good use of colorblind-safe sequential blue colormap
  - Realistic business context with meaningful department performance data
  - Proper colorbar with gradient and labeled scale values
  - Clean cell value annotations with adaptive text color based on background brightness
  - Square canvas format (3600x3600) works well for matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Uses custom class which violates KISS principle (though justified given pygal
    lacks native heatmap support)
  - Colorbar title Score could be more descriptive (e.g., Performance Score (%))
  - No explicit axis titles (could add Department and Quarter labels)
  image_description: The plot displays an 8×8 matrix heatmap showing department performance
    scores across quarters. Row labels on the left show departments (Sales, Marketing,
    Engineering, Support, Finance, HR, Operations, R&D). Column labels at the bottom
    show quarters (Q1 2023 through Q4 2024). Each cell contains a numeric score (58-97
    range) with color intensity representing magnitude - lighter blues for lower scores,
    darker blues for higher scores. A vertical colorbar on the right shows the "Score"
    scale from 58 to 97 with a mid-value of 78. The title "heatmap-basic · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. All text is clearly legible with good contrast,
    and the layout uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio.
