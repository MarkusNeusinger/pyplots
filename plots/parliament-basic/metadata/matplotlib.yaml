review:
  strengths:
  - Clean semicircular layout algorithm with proper seat distribution across 8 concentric
    rows
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using established accessible colors
  - Party arrangement from left to right matches political convention
  - Individual seats clearly visible with white borders providing visual separation
  - Legend includes seat counts in parentheses for quick reference
  - Majority threshold annotation adds context without cluttering the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend ncol=3 creates uneven distribution (2-2-1 parties per row); ncol=2 or ncol=5
    would be more balanced
  - Party names still reference political spectrum (Progressive, Conservative) rather
    than completely neutral names like colors or regions
  - Could use matplotlib patches/collections for more efficient rendering of many
    similar shapes
