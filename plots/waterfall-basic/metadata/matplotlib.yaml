review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waterfall chart logic with proper handling of subtotals
    (None values)
  - Clear visual distinction between positive (green), negative (red), and total (blue)
    bars
  - Connecting dashed lines effectively show the cumulative flow between bars
  - Value labels are well-positioned and highly readable with white text on colored
    bars
  - Realistic financial data scenario that perfectly demonstrates the waterfall chart
    use case
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining the color coding (green=increase, red=decrease, blue=total)
  - X-axis label Category is generic - could be more descriptive like Financial Components
  - Red-green color combination may be challenging for colorblind users
