review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of calibration curve with all required elements (diagonal
    reference, binned probabilities, metrics)
  - Excellent text sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas with clear readability
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern and Label annotation for metrics
  - Clean simple code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate data simulation showing realistic classifier miscalibration behavior
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears small and positioned far from the main plot area
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show bin counts on
    hover
  - Axis labels lack explicit context
