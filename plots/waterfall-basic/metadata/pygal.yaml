review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color scheme using blue/teal/orange instead of problematic
    red/green
  - Creative use of StackedBar with invisible spacer series to achieve waterfall floating
    effect
  - Running totals displayed in x-axis labels provide excellent clarity for financial
    progression
  - Realistic quarterly financial breakdown scenario that demonstrates waterfall chart
    purpose well
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data processing logic
  weaknesses:
  - Empty spacer series appears in legend (should be hidden or legend entry suppressed)
  - Missing connecting lines between bars that spec suggests for emphasizing cumulative
    flow
