review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of seaborn heatmap with all key parameters: annot, fmt, cmap, center,
    vmin/vmax, square, linewidths'
  - Automatic text contrast (white on dark, dark on light) improves readability significantly
  - Financial correlation matrix provides realistic, meaningful context that demonstrates
    the plot type perfectly
  - Square aspect ratio is ideal for correlation matrices
  - Diverging colormap centered at 0 correctly represents positive/negative correlations
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis titles (e.g., Asset Class for both axes) would add context
  - Colorbar could have more intermediate tick values for precision reading
