review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alluvial diagram implementation using creative SVG manipulation to achieve
    a plot type not natively supported by pygal
  - Clear visualization of voter migration flows with properly proportioned bands
    and smooth bezier curves
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between Democratic (blue), Republican
    (red), Independent (yellow), and Other (gray)
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-chosen realistic election data scenario showing meaningful transitions across
    4 election cycles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears redundant since party labels already appear on both left
    and right sides of the diagram
  - The implementation uses custom SVG manipulation rather than native pygal chart
    types, which is creative but deviates from typical pygal usage patterns
