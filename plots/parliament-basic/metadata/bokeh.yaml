review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular parliament visualization with proper concentric arc arrangement
  - Clean center annotation showing total seat count (300) with "seats" label
  - Majority threshold annotation (151 seats) provides useful political context
  - Legend displays party names with seat counts in parentheses as required by spec
  - Good use of Bokeh's Label model for custom annotations
  - Colors are distinct and party sizes are clearly differentiated by arc positioning
  - Properly generates both PNG and HTML output for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - '**Implementation Python file is missing from the PR** - only metadata/bokeh.yaml
    was committed; the actual `plots/parliament-basic/implementations/bokeh.py` file
    needs to be included'
  - Seat dots could be slightly larger (current size=20 may be small at 4800x2700
    resolution)
  - Red (#E74C3C) and Orange (#E67E22) colors are somewhat close for colorblind accessibility
  - Political party names (Progressive, Conservative, etc.) could potentially be replaced
    with more neutral terminology (e.g., "Party A", "Party B") to avoid any political
    connotations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    300 total seats arranged in concentric arcs. Seven parties are represented with
    distinct colors:

    - **Progressive Party (85 seats)** - Blue (#306998) - positioned on the left side

    - **Conservative Union (72 seats)** - Red (#E74C3C) - center-left area

    - **Green Alliance (45 seats)** - Green (#27AE60) - center area

    - **Liberal Democrats (38 seats)** - Yellow (#FFD43B) - center-right area

    - **Social Democrats (32 seats)** - Purple (#9B59B6) - right-center area

    - **Regional Party (18 seats)** - Orange (#E67E22) - right side

    - **Independents (10 seats)** - Gray (#95A5A6) - far right side


    The title reads "parliament-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top. A large "300"
    with "seats" label appears in the center of the semicircle. Below the chart, "Majority
    threshold: 151 seats" is displayed. The legend is positioned on the right side
    showing all parties with their seat counts. Individual seats are rendered as circular
    dots arranged in multiple concentric arcs.'
