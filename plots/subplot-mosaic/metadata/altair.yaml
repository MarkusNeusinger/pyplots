review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of mosaic layout concept using Altair concatenation operators
    (hconcat, vconcat)
  - Clean, professional visual design with consistent color scheme (#306998 blue theme)
  - Good variety of chart types (line, bar, scatter, area, gauge) showing layout flexibility
  - Descriptive axis labels with appropriate units throughout
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with plausible data
  weaknesses:
  - No demonstration of empty cells using placeholder characters (e.g., "." for gaps)
    as mentioned in spec
  - Scatter plot lacks legend for the color encoding (efficiency gradient)
  - HTML version could benefit from interactive features (tooltips, selection) which
    Altair excels at
  image_description: "The plot displays a dashboard-style mosaic layout with 6 panels\
    \ on a white background. The main title \"subplot-mosaic · altair · pyplots.ai\"\
    \ is displayed prominently at the top in large black text. \n\n**Top row:** A\
    \ wide \"Monthly Revenue Overview\" line chart in blue (#306998) showing revenue\
    \ trend from January to April, and a semi-circular gauge showing \"Performance\
    \ Score\" of 78 in blue.\n\n**Middle row:** A \"Sales by Region\" bar chart with\
    \ 5 blue bars (Central, East, North, South, West), and a large \"Efficiency vs\
    \ Output\" scatter plot with circles varying in size and color (blue color scale),\
    \ spanning two rows on the right side.\n\n**Bottom row:** A small yellow \"By\
    \ Category\" bar chart (Type A, B, C) and a \"Daily Traffic Pattern\" area chart\
    \ in blue showing hourly traffic.\n\nAll text is legible, axis labels include\
    \ units where appropriate (Revenue $K, Sales $K, Efficiency %, Output units),\
    \ and the layout demonstrates the mosaic concept well with varying panel sizes."

        comment: Uses Altair's hconcat/vconcat for layout, layering for gauge chart,
          proper encoding types. Could leverage more Altair-specific features like
          selection or interactivity for HTML version
  verdict: APPROVED
