review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for in-segment percentage labels
    with smart visibility threshold (>=10%)
  - Perfect title format and professional styling with appropriate font sizes for
    the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Smart text color contrast (white on dark segments, dark on light segments)
  - Clean normalization logic ensuring bars always sum to 100%
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Blue and cyan colors could be slightly more distinct for better colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing smartphone
    market share by quarter (Q1 2024 through Q1 2025). Five vertical bars represent
    each quarter, with four colored segments stacked to 100%: Apple (Python blue #306998)
    at the bottom, Samsung (golden yellow #FFD43B), Xiaomi (cyan #4ECDC4), and Others
    (gray #95A5A6) at the top. Each segment displays its percentage value (e.g., 28%,
    23%, 14%, 35% for Q1 2024). The title "bar-stacked-percent · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top-left, with a legend in the top-right corner. X-axis shows "Quarter"
    and Y-axis shows "Market Share (%)". White borders separate segments. The layout
    fills the canvas well with balanced proportions.'
