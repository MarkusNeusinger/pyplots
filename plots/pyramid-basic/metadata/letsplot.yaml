review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the pyramid chart concept with proper symmetric axis
    scales
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper ggplot2 grammar
  - Perfect spec compliance including correct title format and all required features
  - Good use of coord_flip() to create horizontal bars with categorical y-axis
  - Custom axis labels showing absolute values on both sides (clever use of scale_y_continuous
    labels)
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with 1600x900 base size scaled 3x
  - Realistic demographic data showing typical population pyramid shape
  weaknesses:
  - Color choice (blue/yellow) while distinguishable could be improved for colorblind
    accessibility - consider using a more standard palette like blue/orange or established
    demographic colors
  - Library-specific features could be leveraged more - lets-plot supports tooltips
    and interactivity that aren't utilized in the HTML output
