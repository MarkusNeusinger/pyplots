review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent layering of geom_area and geom_line to create the filled effect with
    visible line on top
  - Well-chosen alpha value (0.4) matches spec recommendation (0.3-0.5)
  - Clean, professional appearance with consistent Python blue color (#306998)
  - Good use of theme customization for text sizing and grid styling
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with appropriate seasonal variation
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis displays months as decimals (2.5, 5.0, 7.5) instead of integers (1, 2,
    3...12) which is confusing for monthly data
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Website Visitors (thousands) or use K
    formatting)
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart showing monthly website
    visitors over a 12-month period. The area beneath the line is filled with a muted
    blue color (#306998) at approximately 40% transparency, creating a clear area
    chart effect. A darker blue line of the same color traces the top edge of the
    filled region. The y-axis labeled "Website Visitors" ranges from 0 to approximately
    70,000, and the x-axis labeled "Month" shows values from about 1 to 12.5 (displayed
    as decimal values like 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, etc.). The title "line-filled · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. The data shows some variation
    with peaks around months 4 and 11, and troughs around months 2 and 8. The background
    is clean with a subtle grid, and the overall layout is well-balanced with the
    plot filling the canvas appropriately.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_area + geom_line layering,
          theme_minimal, and element_text customization. Good use of grammar of graphics
          but could leverage more plotnine-specific features.
  verdict: APPROVED
