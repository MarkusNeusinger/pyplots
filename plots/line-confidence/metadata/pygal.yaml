review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic data scenario (user growth prediction model)
  - Creative approach using polygon to create confidence band
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing
  - Fixed random seed ensures reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence band is not visible in the rendered output - the polygon approach with
    fill=True is not rendering the shaded area as expected
  - The first color in the style (#306998 blue) should be for the confidence band
    but the fill is not being applied or is transparent
  - Legend shows 95% Confidence Interval but the corresponding visual element is missing
    from the plot
