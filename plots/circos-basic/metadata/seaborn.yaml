review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with well-proportioned segments and gaps
  - Inner data track effectively shows secondary trade volume information
  - Ribbon bezier curves are smooth and visually appealing with proper transparency
  - Region labels are well-rotated and positioned for readability
  - Tab10 color palette provides good visual distinction between segments
  - Comprehensive legend explaining all visual components
  weaknesses:
  - Title format does not strictly follow the required pattern (spec-id should be
    first, not the descriptive title)
  - Seaborn is only used for theming and color palette, not for actual plotting functions
    - this is a limitation of the library for Circos plots
  - Some ribbons in the center appear quite dense and could benefit from slightly
    more transparency
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circular Circos visualization showing global
    trade flows between 10 world regions. The outer ring consists of colored arc segments
    representing regions: North America (pink), East Asia (olive/yellow-green), Europe
    (orange), South Asia (green), Middle East (teal), Southeast Asia (light green),
    Africa (cyan/teal), Oceania (blue), South America (light purple), and Central
    Asia (magenta). Each segment''s arc length is proportional to the region''s total
    trade volume. An inner concentric track shows bar heights representing trade volume
    for each region. Ribbons connect regions through the center, with widths proportional
    to trade flow values. The title "Global Trade Flows · circos-basic · seaborn ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Labels for each region are positioned outside
    the ring with appropriate rotation for readability.'

        comment: Seaborn is only used for sns.set_theme() and sns.color_palette();
          no seaborn plotting functions are used. The actual plotting is done entirely
          with matplotlib. This is a fundamental limitation as Circos plots are not
          native to seaborn.
  verdict: APPROVED
