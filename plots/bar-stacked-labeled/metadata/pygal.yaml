review:
  strengths:
  - Total labels are correctly positioned and formatted above each bar stack
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for large canvas sizing
  - Colors are well-chosen and colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic quarterly revenue data context
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is cut off/truncated - only partial category names visible
  - Data segments have relatively uniform proportions across quarters - could show
    more variation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart with 4 quarters (Q1, Q2,
    Q3, Q4) on the x-axis and Revenue ($K) on the y-axis. Each bar consists of 4 stacked
    segments representing product categories: Electronics (steel blue at the bottom),
    Furniture (golden yellow), Clothing (teal/cyan), and Accessories (coral/salmon
    at the top). Total value labels are prominently displayed above each bar stack
    showing "Total: $312K", "Total: $364K", "Total: $346K", and "Total: $430K" respectively.
    The title correctly shows "bar-stacked-labeled · pygal · pyplots.ai". The background
    is white with subtle horizontal grid lines. A legend appears at the bottom but
    is partially cut off, showing only "Electronics", "Furniture" and partial text
    for other categories.'
