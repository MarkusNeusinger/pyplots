review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of frequency polygon for comparing distributions with
    different characteristics (unimodal vs bimodal)
  - Clean, publication-ready appearance with appropriate font sizes for the resolution
  - Good data scenario choice (response times in psychology research)
  - Properly uses lets-plot grammar of graphics approach with geom_freqpoly
  - Correct title format and clear axis labeling with units
  - Three-way comparison effectively shows the advantage of frequency polygons over
    histograms for comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests extending lines to zero at both ends to close the polygon shape
    - currently lines do not extend to the baseline
  - Color palette includes red which could be improved for colorblind accessibility
    (consider using blue-orange-purple instead)
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (current alpha seems to be default)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a frequency polygon comparing three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) with response times in milliseconds
    on the x-axis (ranging from ~125 to ~525 ms) and frequency on the y-axis (0-32).
    Three colored lines are shown: blue for Control (centered around 350ms), yellow
    for Treatment A (centered around 300ms with higher peak around 29), and red for
    Treatment B (showing a bimodal distribution with peaks around 270ms and 420ms).
    The title reads "frequency-polygon-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in the correct
    format. A legend labeled "Condition" appears on the right side. The plot uses
    a minimal white/light gray background with subtle gridlines. Lines are distinct
    and clearly differentiated.'

        comment: 'Lines are thick enough (size=2.5) to be clearly visible. The three
          distributions are easily distinguishable. Minor deduction: some line segments
          at the extremes are quite thin when frequencies are low.'

          200 observations per group is within recommended range.

        comment: Uses geom_freqpoly which is a lets-plot native geom, scale_color_manual,
          theme_minimal, and HTML export. Good use of lets-plot features but could
          leverage more interactive capabilities.
