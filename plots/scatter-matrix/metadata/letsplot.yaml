review:
  strengths:
  - Clean 4×4 matrix layout with proper use of ggbunch for combining individual plots
  - Excellent color scheme with distinct species differentiation
  - Proper implementation of histogram diagonals and scatter off-diagonals
  - Good use of theme_minimal() and appropriate transparency for overlapping data
  - Title and legend placement are well-balanced
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels abbreviated without units (Sepal Len instead of Sepal Length (cm))
  - Wildcard import style could be cleaner with explicit imports
  - Could use geom_density() on diagonal for smoother distribution visualization as
    alternative
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix showing pairwise
    relationships between four Iris flower measurements: Sepal Length (Sepal Len),
    Sepal Width (Sepal Wid), Petal Length (Petal Len), and Petal Width (Petal Wid).
    The diagonal cells contain overlapping histograms showing the distribution of
    each variable, while off-diagonal cells show scatter plots of variable pairs.
    Three species are color-coded: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor (yellow #FFD43B),
    and Virginica (red #DC2626). The title "scatter-matrix · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend at the bottom identifies the three species. The plot
    uses a white background with minimal grid styling. Variable names appear on both
    the left y-axis labels and bottom x-axis labels of the matrix.'

        comment: Title is bold and large (~32pt), axis labels are ~18pt, tick labels
          ~14pt. All text is readable, though tick labels could be slightly larger
          for optimal viewing at full resolution.

        comment: 'Point size (3.5) and alpha (0.7) work well for 150 data points.
          Histograms are clear with good transparency. Minor: some scatter panels
          show slight overplotting but still readable.'

        comment: Blue/Yellow/Red palette is distinguishable. Yellow and Red could
          be slightly problematic for some colorblind users, but generally acceptable.

        comment: Labels are descriptive ("Sepal Len", "Petal Wid") but abbreviated
          without units. Original column names had units "(cm)" but were shortened.

        comment: Uses ggbunch for combining plots, ggplot grammar of graphics, scale_color_manual/scale_fill_manual,
          theme customization. Good use of lets-plot features but could leverage more
          advanced features like geom_density for diagonal instead of histogram.
  verdict: APPROVED
