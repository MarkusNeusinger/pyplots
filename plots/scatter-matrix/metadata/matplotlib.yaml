review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the scatter matrix concept with proper histograms
    on diagonal and scatter plots off-diagonal
  - Good use of color encoding to distinguish three species with a colorblind-friendly
    palette
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Realistic Iris-like data that clearly demonstrates the purpose of scatter matrices
  - Proper axis labeling with units on edges only (not repeated in every subplot)
  - Symmetric matrix as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes are smaller than matplotlib library guidelines recommend (title 20pt
    vs 24pt, labels 13pt vs 20pt, ticks 11pt vs 16pt)
  - Marker size s=40 is on the smaller side for 150 data points; s=60-80 would improve
    visibility
  - Does not use distinctive matplotlib features like pandas integration or advanced
    subplot formatting
  - Figure size 12x12 produces approximately 3600x3600 at dpi=300, which is correct
    for square format, but the internal spacing could be tighter
