review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe palette from seaborn
  - Clear visual hierarchy with party labels on both left and right edges including
    voter counts
  - Smooth curved Bezier flow bands with appropriate transparency
  - Good data narrative showing voter migration patterns across election cycles
  - Adaptive alpha for smaller flows improves visibility
  - Clean white background and proper title format
  weaknesses:
  - No formal legend box (inline labels work but a legend would be cleaner)
  - Limited use of seaborn core plotting functions since alluvial diagrams require
    custom matplotlib patches
  image_description: 'The plot displays an alluvial diagram showing US voter migration
    across 4 election cycles (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024). Four vertical stacked bars
    represent each year, with segments colored by party: Democratic (blue), Republican
    (orange), Independent (green), and Other (gray). The colorblind-safe palette from
    seaborn is used. Curved flow bands connect the bars showing voter transitions
    between parties, with band widths proportional to flow magnitude. The title follows
    the required format "alluvial-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. Labels
    on the left (2012) and right (2024) edges show party names with voter counts in
    millions. Each year column header shows the year and total voters. An italicized
    subtitle at the bottom explains the data context.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_style, sns.set_context, sns.color_palette; however,
          the core plotting uses matplotlib patches rather than seaborn plot functions
          (alluvial is not a native seaborn plot type)
  verdict: APPROVED
