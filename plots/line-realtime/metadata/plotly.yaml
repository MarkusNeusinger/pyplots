review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of real-time visualization indicators (LIVE badge, current
    value marker, scrolling direction arrow)
  - Creative use of vrect shapes to create fade effect indicating data scroll direction
  - Well-structured code with realistic CPU usage data including oscillation pattern
    and spikes
  - Good use of Plotly annotation system for the arrow and text labels
  - Outputs both static PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptor before spec-id instead of exact format
  - Fade effect using vrect covers some data points reducing left portion readability
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is too subtle, could be 0.2-0.3 for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitor with a continuous
    blue line (#306998) tracing CPU percentage over 120 seconds. A light blue gradient
    fill extends from the line to the x-axis. The x-axis shows "Time (seconds)" ranging
    from 0-120, while the y-axis displays "CPU Usage (%)" from 0-100. The title reads
    "CPU Usage Monitor · line-realtime · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top center. A
    prominent yellow circular marker with blue border highlights the latest data point
    (32.6%) with a text label above it. The left side features a white gradient fade
    effect indicating the scrolling direction, accompanied by a blue arrow and "←
    Data scrolls" annotation. A red "● LIVE" indicator appears in the lower right
    corner. The legend in the upper right shows "CPU Usage" and "Current: 32.6%".
    The data exhibits realistic CPU patterns with baseline oscillation around 35-40%
    and several spikes reaching up to ~75%.'

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with fill, add_annotation, add_vrect for fade effect,
          interactive HTML output; however could have leveraged more Plotly-specific
          features like animation frames
  verdict: APPROVED
