review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scipy dendrogram output to extract coordinates for Altair rendering
  - Clean two-color scheme distinguishing high vs low-level merges based on threshold
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labeling
  - Species cluster correctly demonstrating hierarchical relationships
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Minor empty space on right side of plot could be reduced
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical dendrogram with 15 iris flower
    samples (5 each of Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The vertical tree structure
    shows "Distance (Ward)" on the Y-axis (0-11 range). Sample labels appear at the
    bottom rotated 45 degrees. A two-color scheme distinguishes cluster levels: blue
    (#306998) for high-level merges above the threshold, yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for
    lower-level clusters. Species group appropriately: Setosa clusters on the left,
    Versicolor and Virginica on the right, with all merging at ~10.1 distance.'

        comment: Creative use of mark_rule with x/x2/y/y2 encoding and layering, but
          workaround since Altair lacks native dendrogram support
  verdict: APPROVED
