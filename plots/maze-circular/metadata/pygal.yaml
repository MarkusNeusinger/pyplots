review:
  strengths:
  - Entry arrow (blue) and goal star (red) are clearly visible and properly positioned
  - Title follows the correct format specification
  - Kruskal algorithm generates a valid maze structure in the code
  - White background is print-friendly as per spec
  - Good use of pygal custom styling and XY chart for coordinate-based drawing
  weaknesses:
  - Maze walls render as jagged, broken lines instead of smooth circular arcs - this
    appears to be a fundamental issue with how pygal XY chart renders curved paths
  - Wall segments overlap chaotically rather than forming clean ring corridors
  - The maze is not practically solvable as a puzzle due to visual confusion
  - Code uses functions (find, union, arc_pts) which violates the KISS structure requirement
  - Pygal may not be the ideal library for smooth curve rendering - its XY chart connects
    points linearly
  image_description: The plot displays what is intended to be a circular maze puzzle,
    but the rendering has significant issues. The title "maze-circular · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in gray text. The visualization shows a series of concentric
    circular shapes with black lines, but the lines appear jagged and broken rather
    than smooth arcs. Instead of clean curved walls forming ring-shaped corridors,
    the maze shows angular, fragmented paths that create a chaotic pattern. A red
    star is visible at the center (the goal marker), and a blue arrow is visible on
    the right edge (the entry marker). The white background is clean, but the maze
    structure itself looks corrupted - the curves are rendered as jagged line segments,
    and the wall segments do not connect properly, making the maze appear more like
    abstract geometric art than a solvable puzzle.
