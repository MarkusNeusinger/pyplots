review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature data that clearly demonstrates the time series
    pattern
  - Well-implemented brush selection with linked overview panel (classic focus+context
    technique)
  - Proper tooltip formatting with date and temperature values
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  - Good use of Altair's declarative encoding and selection parameters
  weaknesses:
  - Missing mouse wheel zoom and click-drag pan functionality (spec explicitly requests
    these)
  - No reset zoom button to return to full view
  - Could add .interactive() to main chart for built-in zoom/pan capabilities
  - Overview panel Y-axis label is slightly cramped/overlapping
