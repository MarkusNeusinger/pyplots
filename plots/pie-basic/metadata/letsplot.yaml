  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with subtitle providing a clear narrative insight
    about the data
  - Clean use of lets-plot-specific geom_pie() features (spacers, stroke, explode,
    layer_labels)
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for 4800x2700 output
  - Colorblind-safe custom palette starting with Python Blue
  - Deterministic, realistic data with a recognizable real-world context
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout imbalance: significant empty space in the bottom third of the canvas;
    pie is offset left while legend is far right'
  - Exploded slice is Apple (23.1%) rather than the largest (Others, 35%) or smallest
    (OPPO, 8.8%) as specified
  - Canvas utilization could be improved — the pie could be larger or centered better
    to fill the 16:9 space more effectively
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart titled "Global Smartphone Market
    Share · pie-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Apple leads named
    brands at 23.1% — but ''Others'' hold the largest share at 35%". Five slices represent:
    Apple (dark blue, 23.1%), Samsung (golden yellow, 19.4%), Xiaomi (green, 13.7%),
    OPPO (coral/orange, 8.8%), and Others (muted gray, 35.0%). The Apple slice is
    slightly exploded outward from the center. Each slice has a percentage label positioned
    inside. A legend titled "Brand" with colored dots sits on the right side. White
    spacers cleanly separate the slices. The pie is centered slightly left with notable
    empty space in the bottom third of the canvas. theme_void() provides a clean white
    background with no axes or grid.'
