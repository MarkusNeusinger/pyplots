review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm with physics simulation that produces tight,
    non-overlapping layout
  - Clear area-proportional scaling using sqrt transformation as specified
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual appeal
  - Well-formatted labels inside large bubbles with department name and budget
  - Proper use of Altair layering for circles and text
  - Interactive tooltips in HTML export provide additional context
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Small bubbles (HR, Legal, Security, QA) lack visible labels in the static PNG
    - only accessible via tooltips in HTML
  - No legend explaining what colors represent (even though colors are cyclic, a note
    would help)
  - The optional grouping feature from the spec could have been demonstrated to show
    clustering capability
  image_description: The plot displays a packed bubble chart showing department budget
    allocation across 15 departments. Each department is represented by a circle whose
    size corresponds to its budget value. The circles are packed together without
    overlap using a physics-based simulation. The color scheme uses a colorblind-safe
    palette with Python Blue (#306998), Yellow (#FFD43B), Teal (#4A90A4), Sage Green
    (#7B9E89), and Coral (#E07A5F). The largest circles (Engineering $850K, R&D $750K,
    Sales $680K) are prominently displayed near the center, while smaller departments
    are positioned around them. Labels with department names and budget values (e.g.,
    "Engineering $850K") are displayed inside the larger bubbles in white text. The
    title "Department Budget Allocation · bubble-packed · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. No axes are visible as this is a packed bubble chart where position
    has no meaning - only size matters.

        comment: Title at 28pt is excellent, labels inside bubbles are readable in
          white bold text. Slightly docked because some smaller bubbles lack visible
          labels.

        comment: Good use of Altair's declarative approach with layered marks, tooltips,
          and mark_text. However, the circle packing is done manually in Python rather
          than leveraging any Altair-specific features. Altair is primarily used for
          rendering.
  verdict: APPROVED
