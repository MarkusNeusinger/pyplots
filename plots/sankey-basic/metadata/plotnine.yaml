review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of Sankey diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics with
    geom_polygon for curved flow bands
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color scheme with distinct colors for each energy source
  - Clean visual design with transparent flows showing overlapping paths clearly
  - Realistic energy flow data matching specification example domain
  - Good use of smooth bezier-like curves for flow paths using cubic interpolation
  weaknesses:
  - Node rectangles are rendered in uniform gray rather than matching their source/target
    colors
  - Flow value labels are not displayed on the diagram
  - Node label font size (14pt) could be slightly larger for optimal readability
