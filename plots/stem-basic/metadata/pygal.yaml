review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of stem plot concept using pygal XY chart with None separators
    to create discrete stems
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Appropriate data showing decaying oscillation pattern typical of impulse response
  - Title format is correct and text is generally legible
  - Good color choice with accessible blue
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label shows Amplitude in the code with units (a.u.) but the rendered image
    only shows Amplitude - the units are missing
  - Markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at this canvas size (dots_size=14
    may need to be increased)
  - The stem lines could be more prominent - currently quite thin and may be hard
    to see
