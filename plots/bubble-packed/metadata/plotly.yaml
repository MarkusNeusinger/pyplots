review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed circle packing algorithm implementation that correctly
    avoids overlap
  - Proper area scaling (sqrt) for accurate visual perception as specified
  - Clean, readable labels positioned inside bubbles with dynamic font sizing
  - Rich hover templates with formatted budget values
  - Good color palette starting with Python colors
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Realistic department budget data with appropriate value range
  weaknesses:
  - No legend showing total budget or providing a size reference scale
  - Text in smallest bubbles (Admin, Legal, Design) appears slightly cramped
  - Optional grouping feature from spec not demonstrated (though marked optional)
