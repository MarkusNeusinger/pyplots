  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using plotnine grammar of graphics idiom
  - Error bars have visible caps (width=0.3) as specified in requirements
  - Good font sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Realistic lab measurement scenario with appropriate data values
  - Proper use of theme_minimal() for clean appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines would improve readability (add panel_grid with subtle alpha)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Measurement Value (units) would be more informative)
  image_description: The plot displays a basic error bar chart with 6 experimental
    samples (Sample A through F) on the x-axis and Measurement Value on the y-axis
    (ranging from ~30 to ~58). Each sample is represented by a blue point (#306998
    color) with vertical error bars extending above and below. The error bars have
    visible horizontal caps at both ends. The title "errorbar-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with a light gray
    background and subtle grid lines. All text is clearly legible with good font sizes.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_errorbar and geom_point,
          theme_minimal, but doesn't leverage advanced plotnine features like faceting
          or scale customization
  verdict: APPROVED
