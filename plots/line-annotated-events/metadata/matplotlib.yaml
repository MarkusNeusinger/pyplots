review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the spec with clear event annotations using axvline
    and annotate
  - Smart use of alternating heights to prevent annotation overlap
  - Professional styling with white background boxes and arrow connections
  - Realistic stock price data with quarterly earnings context
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entry for Event Marker uses alpha=0 trick which creates an invisible line
    in the legend - consider using a Line2D proxy artist instead
  - Could utilize more distinctive matplotlib features like ConnectionPatch for arrows
    or custom box styles
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price time series (blue line, ~#306998)
    spanning January 2024 to January 2025, with prices ranging from approximately
    120 to 160 USD. Five event markers are annotated using yellow/gold (#FFD43B) dashed
    vertical lines: "Q4 2023 Earnings" (Feb), "Q1 2024 Earnings" (May), "Product Launch"
    (July), "Q2 2024 Earnings" (Aug), and "Q3 2024 Earnings" (Nov). Each annotation
    has a white background box with yellow border and an arrow pointing to the event
    date on the line. The annotations use alternating heights (higher/lower) to prevent
    overlap. A legend in the upper left shows "Stock Price" (blue line) and "Event
    Marker" (yellow dashed). The title reads "line-annotated-events · matplotlib ·
    pyplots.ai". X-axis shows dates rotated for readability, Y-axis shows "Price (USD)".
    Grid is subtle with dashed lines at alpha 0.3.'
