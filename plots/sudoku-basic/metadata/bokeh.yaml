review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear thick/thin line distinction for 3×3 boxes
    vs cells
  - Perfect monochrome design matching spec requirements for printability
  - Numbers well-centered and sized for readability at 60pt font
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Clean KISS code structure without unnecessary complexity
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Feature coverage could show more variety in number distribution across the puzzle
  - Library features usage is basic - could leverage ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic
    Bokeh code
  image_description: The plot displays a standard 9×9 Sudoku grid with a clean black-and-white
    design. The title "sudoku-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold
    text. The grid uses thick black lines to separate the nine 3×3 boxes and thin
    black lines for individual cell boundaries. Numbers (1-9) are displayed in bold
    black font, centered within their cells. Empty cells are blank (no zeros shown).
    The overall layout is square with balanced proportions, and the grid fills a good
    portion of the canvas. The monochrome design is suitable for printing.
