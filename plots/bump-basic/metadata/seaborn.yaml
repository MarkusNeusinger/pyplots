review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with inverted Y-axis correctly placing rank 1 at top
  - Clean color palette starting with Python blue (#306998) as first color
  - Well-positioned legend outside plot area preventing data overlap
  - Data shows interesting narrative with multiple overtakes and rank changes
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with hue for categorical grouping
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., "Competition Week" and "League Position")
