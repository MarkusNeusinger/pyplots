review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround for pygal's lack of native quiver support using XY chart with
    segmented lines for arrow shafts and heads
  - Excellent real-world scenario with wind patterns around low-pressure system
  - Good colorblind-friendly color palette transitioning from blue to orange/red
  - Proper magnitude-based grouping with descriptive wind speed labels
  - Clean code structure with good comments explaining the physics
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text is very small and positioned awkwardly in the top-left corner, making
    it hard to read
  - Arrow line thickness appears thin relative to the large canvas size
  - The math module is imported alongside numpy which already provides the same trigonometric
    functions
