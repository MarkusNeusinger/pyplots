review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of tile grid map approach which works well for Bokeh rect glyph
    capabilities
  - Smart handling of missing data with gray color and nan_color configuration
  - Good text contrast logic - white text on dark backgrounds, blue text on light
    backgrounds
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Realistic population density data with proper units in the legend
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should follow exact spec pattern "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai"
    not include data description
  - Color bar is functional but relatively small compared to the main plot; could
    be more prominent
  - Some very low density states (AK, WY, MT, etc.) are nearly indistinguishable from
    each other in the lightest color band
