review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clearly distinguishable thick (3×3 box) and thin
    (cell) lines
  - Numbers are large, bold, and perfectly centered using Arial Black font
  - Clean monochrome design ideal for printing as specified
  - Uses proper square aspect ratio (1:1) appropriate for Sudoku
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs, leveraging Plotly dual-output capability
  - Real, solvable Sudoku puzzle data rather than random numbers
  weaknesses:
  - Output size 3600×3600 differs from standard 4800×2700 landscape format (though
    square is appropriate for Sudoku)
  - Could add subtle hover tooltips showing cell coordinates to leverage Plotly interactivity
  - Thin line width (1.5) could be slightly thicker (2.0) for better print visibility
    at smaller sizes
  image_description: The plot displays a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle grid on a clean white background.
    The grid uses a clear visual hierarchy with thick black lines (width 5) separating
    the nine 3×3 box regions, and thinner black lines (width 1.5) dividing individual
    cells. Numbers (1-9) are displayed in large black Arial Black font, centered within
    their cells. Empty cells are properly blank with no zeros shown. The title "sudoku-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in black text. The puzzle shows
    a classic partially-filled Sudoku with numbers distributed across all regions.
    The overall design is monochrome (black and white only), clean, and suitable for
    printing.

        comment: Uses Plotly's annotation system and Scatter traces for custom drawing.
          Also generates HTML for interactivity. Could leverage more Plotly-specific
          features like hover information for educational purposes.
  verdict: APPROVED
