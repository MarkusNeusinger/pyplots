review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density representation
  - Good multi-cluster data generation that demonstrates density visualization effectively
  - Includes interactive tooltips showing bin ranges and counts (HTML version)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and readable font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Uses rectangular bins (mark_rect) instead of hexagonal bins - this is the core
    spec requirement; consider noting this limitation in the title or exploring workarounds
  - Generic axis labels (X Value, Y Value) instead of contextual labels like Longitude
    or Sensor Reading
  - Chart dimensions (1400x800) do not match recommended Altair dimensions (1600x900)
  - Data lacks real-world context - could use a realistic scenario from the spec applications
