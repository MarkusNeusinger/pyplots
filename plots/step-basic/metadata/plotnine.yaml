review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following plotnine grammar of graphics approach with geom_step
    + geom_point layering
  - Excellent color contrast between blue step line and yellow markers
  - Perfect title format and axis label sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that demonstrates step plot characteristics
    well
  - Minimal theme with subtle grid provides professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows decimal values (2.5, 5.0, 7.5) instead of integer months 1-12; should
    use scale_x_continuous with breaks=range(1,13)
  - Data could show more dramatic variation in step heights to better demonstrate
    the plot type ability to show sudden changes
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart with a blue (#306998) stair-step
    line pattern showing cumulative sales over 12 months. Yellow (#FFD43B) circular
    markers highlight each data point where values change. The x-axis shows "Month"
    (1-12, displayed as continuous with decimal values like 2.5, 5.0, etc.), and the
    y-axis shows "Cumulative Sales (thousands)" ranging from approximately 12 to 125.
    The title correctly reads "step-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The minimal theme
    provides a clean background with subtle gray grid lines. The stair-step pattern
    clearly demonstrates the "constant until next change" behavior characteristic
    of step plots.

        comment: Values 12-120K are realistic for sales; month axis shows decimal
          values (2.5, 5.0) instead of integers which is slightly awkward for discrete

        comment: Uses plotnine's ggplot grammar correctly (geom_step, geom_point,
          theme_minimal), but doesn't showcase advanced features like scale_x_continuous
          with breaks for integer months
  verdict: APPROVED
