review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue for totals, orange for decreases,
    teal for increases)
  - Clean waterfall visualization with proper connecting lines between bars
  - Data labels show +/- prefixes for clarity on direction of change
  - Realistic financial scenario that demonstrates the waterfall concept well
  - Proper use of Highcharts isSum property for the final total bar
  - Title follows the required pyplots.ai format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle and could be more visible for easier value reading
  - Data labels on smaller bars appear somewhat cramped
  - X-axis Category label is not particularly informative for this financial context
