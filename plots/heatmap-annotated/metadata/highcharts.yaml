review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging colormap (blue-white-yellow) that is colorblind-safe
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean and readable correlation matrix with appropriate annotation formatting
  - Good use of square aspect ratio (3600×3600) ideal for correlation matrices
  - Proper numeric formatting (2 decimal places) for correlation values
  - Realistic financial indicators context for the correlation data
  - White cell borders provide clear visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw JSON/JavaScript approach instead of highcharts-core Python library as
    documented in prompts/library/highcharts.md
  - Annotation font size could be slightly larger for better readability at a distance
  - Colorbar legend labels are small relative to the chart size
  image_description: The plot shows a 7×7 correlation matrix heatmap for financial
    indicators (Revenue, Profit, Growth, ROI, Debt, Assets, Employees). The heatmap
    uses a diverging colormap with blue for negative correlations (-1), white for
    zero, and golden-yellow for positive correlations (+1). Each cell displays its
    correlation value with 2 decimal places (e.g., 1.00 on the diagonal, -0.84 for
    Growth-Assets). The title reads "heatmap-annotated · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. Both axes are labeled "Variables" with category labels on x-axis (bottom)
    and y-axis (left). A vertical colorbar legend on the right shows the scale from
    -1 to 1. Cell borders are white, creating clear separation between cells.

        comment: Colorbar legend is well-positioned. White cell borders serve as grid.
          Legend labels could be slightly larger.

        comment: Shows positive and negative correlations, diagonal ones, varying

        comment: Correlation values are in valid range [-1, 1]. Matrix is symmetric
          as expected. Some values seem slightly random for financial data but acceptable.

        comment: Imports json and urllib.request but these are necessary. However,
          the code doesn't use highcharts-core library as recommended in library rules

        comment: Uses Highcharts heatmap module with dataLabels, colorAxis with stops.
          However, doesn't use highcharts-core Python library as documented in library
          rules, instead uses raw JSON/JavaScript approach.
