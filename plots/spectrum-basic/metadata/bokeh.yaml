review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper text sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clear peak highlighting with dashed vertical lines and circle markers at 50 Hz,
    150 Hz, and 400 Hz
  - Good use of varea for the subtle fill under the curve which aids visual interpretation
  - Proper FFT implementation with correct normalization and dB conversion
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small relative to the canvas size; could benefit from larger
    legend text
  - Missing HoverTool which would showcase Bokeh interactivity for showing exact frequency/amplitude
    values
