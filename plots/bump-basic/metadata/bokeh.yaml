review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following KISS principle with clear data→plot→save structure
  - Correct Y-axis inversion (rank 1 at top) as required by spec
  - Effective use of Category10 colorblind-safe palette
  - Good marker and line sizing for data density
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for Bokeh best practices
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for maximum usability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend label font size (18pt) appears small in the rendered image relative to
    other text elements
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show team name and rank on hover for better interactivity
