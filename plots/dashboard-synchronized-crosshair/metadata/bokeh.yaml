review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource for linked data, CrosshairTool
    for synchronized crosshairs, HoverTool with vline mode'
  - Proper x-axis linking with x_range=p1.x_range for synchronized zoom/pan
  - Clean stacked vertical layout with hidden x-axis labels on upper charts
  - RSI reference lines at 70 and 30 with appropriate dashed styling
  - Appropriate color scheme with blue for price/RSI and gold for volume
  - Good text sizing for the high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement appears pushed to right edge in the static render, making it
    visually cramped
  - Grid and legend styling could be more prominent
  image_description: The plot shows a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with three
    vertically stacked panels sharing a common x-axis (Date from Jan 2024 to Sep 2024).
    The top chart displays a blue line showing stock Price ($) ranging from approximately
    80 to 110, with characteristic random walk behavior. The middle chart shows yellow/gold
    vertical bars representing Volume (M) ranging from 0 to 7 million, with bars of
    varying heights. The bottom chart displays a blue line showing RSI (Relative Strength
    Index) ranging from 20 to 80, with red and gray dashed horizontal reference lines
    at 70 and 30 respectively. All charts have a light gray (#FAFAFA) background,
    subtle grid lines, and legends positioned in the top-left corner. The title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top of the first chart. The layout demonstrates
    the stacked vertical arrangement with shared x-axis alignment.
