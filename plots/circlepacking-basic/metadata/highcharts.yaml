review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of Highcharts packedbubble chart with splitSeries to achieve circle packing
    effect
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Realistic software project structure context
  - Proper interactive HTML output alongside PNG
  - Well-configured layout algorithm with gravity and parent node styling
  - Data labels filter appropriately hides labels on smaller bubbles
  weaknesses:
  - Child bubbles are not fully contained within parent circles (Services bubble extends
    below Backend boundary)
  - No legend visible in the rendered image to identify category names
  - Some label overlap between adjacent bubbles (Pages/Middleware)
  - Parent node boundaries overlap with each other creating visual confusion
  - Library version not properly detected in header
