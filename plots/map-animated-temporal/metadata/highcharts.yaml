review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec-required features: play/pause, time slider,
    timestamp display'
  - Clean interactive HTML with smooth 800ms transitions between frames
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme throughout
  - Well-designed data generation showing temporal spread pattern from 5 seed cities
  - Good use of Highcharts Maps module with mapbubble series type
  weaknesses:
  - The colorbar legend is positioned far to the right, creating some visual imbalance
  - Sensor value scale (10-120) is generic and could have more meaningful units
  image_description: 'The plot displays an animated map of Europe showing sensor data
    spreading across time. The map shows a gray basemap of Europe with country boundaries.
    Five bubble markers are positioned at Western European cities (London, Paris,
    Brussels, Zurich area, and Rome). The bubbles are cyan/teal colored with varying
    sizes representing sensor values. At the top is the title "map-animated-temporal
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Date: 2024-01-01". On the
    right side is a vertical color bar legend showing the sensor value scale from
    0-120 with a blue-to-cyan-to-purple gradient. At the bottom center are interactive
    controls: a blue "▶ Play" button, a horizontal time slider, and the current date
    display "2024-01-01". The overall layout is clean with the map well-centered and
    controls clearly visible.'
