review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all forest plot elements (diamond, whiskers, reference
    line, weighted markers)
  - Realistic medical meta-analysis data with appropriate study naming conventions
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper Bokeh idioms (ColumnDataSource, Span, Label)
  - Good visual hierarchy distinguishing individual studies from pooled estimate
  - Proper use of Bokeh patch() for diamond shape
  weaknesses:
  - Right side of canvas has excessive whitespace (x_range extends to 4 but data only
    goes to ~-0.2)
  - All studies favor treatment - missing a study crossing the null line would better
    demonstrate forest plot capabilities
  - Could add HoverTool for interactivity (a Bokeh strength)
