  strengths:
  - 'Effective data storytelling: narrative subtitle + highlighted leader bar with
    star annotation and percentage share creates a clear visual narrative'
  - Strong color hierarchy using dark vs muted blue to draw attention to the key data
    point
  - Clean, publication-quality design with custom Style, rounded bars, and subtle
    dotted gridlines
  - Good use of pygal-specific features (per-bar dict format, individual formatters,
    rounded_bars)
  - Realistic, neutral dataset (website traffic by channel) with non-monotonic values
  weaknesses:
  - Minor extra whitespace below the x-axis title area; bottom margin could be better
    utilized
  - Per-bar loop with lambda formatter is slightly verbose — could be simplified
  - DE-01 could reach 8/8 with more typographic refinement (e.g., subtitle font differentiation
    from title)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" with a narrative subtitle "Organic Search dominates Q4 2025 traffic
    at 28% share." There are 7 bars representing website traffic channels: Organic
    Search, Direct, Social Media, Email, Referral, Paid Ads, and Affiliates. The leader
    bar (Organic Search, ~142,500 visits) is rendered in a dark Python blue (#306998)
    with a star annotation "★ 142,500 (28% of total)", while all other bars use a
    muted light blue (#A8C4D8). Each bar has a formatted value label above it. The
    x-axis is labeled "Channel" and the y-axis "Visits (Q4 2025)" with major gridlines
    at 0, 30K, 60K, 90K, 120K, and 150K shown as subtle dotted lines. The background
    is white, bars have subtle rounded corners, and no legend is shown (appropriate
    for single series). The layout is clean with balanced proportions.'
