review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of realistic voter migration data that perfectly demonstrates
    alluvial diagram use case
  - Clean visual design with good color choices and appropriate transparency for flow
    bands
  - Smooth curved flows using parametric interpolation with easing function
  - Proper dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging lets-plot interactivity
  - Direct labeling strategy eliminates need for separate legend while maintaining
    clarity
  - Title follows required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions (calculate_node_positions, add_flows) deviate slightly from pure
    KISS flat script style
  - Yellow (Independents) could be more distinguishable from gray (Non-Voters) in
    certain viewing conditions
