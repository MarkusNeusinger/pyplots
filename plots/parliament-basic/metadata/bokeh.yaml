review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular layout algorithm distributing seats across concentric arcs
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, Legend, export_png)
  - Clean visual presentation with white edges on dots for separation
  - Proper title format and majority threshold annotation
  - HTML output enables interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Uses political party names which violates content policy - must use
    neutral data (e.g., company departments, academic departments, fictional categories)'
  - Color palette includes similar blue/purple tones that may be hard to distinguish
    for colorblind users
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    400 total seats arranged in 8 concentric arcs. Individual seats are rendered as
    colored dots with white edges. The title "parliament-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in large font. Six parties are represented with distinct colors:
    Progressive Alliance (85 seats, blue #306998), Green Coalition (42 seats, green
    #2E8B57), Center Party (58 seats, yellow #FFD43B), Liberal Democrats (67 seats,
    orange #FFA500), Conservative Union (92 seats, dark red #8B0000), and National
    Front (56 seats, purple #4B0082). Seats fill from left to right across the semicircle.
    A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all party names with seat counts. Below
    the semicircle, text indicates "Majority threshold: 201 seats (Total: 400)". The
    chart uses a clean white background with no axes or grid lines.'
