review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine native patchwork-style composition operators (| and
    /) for grid layout
  - Clean implementation of 4 distinct plot types demonstrating subplot-grid versatility
  - Good color scheme with consistent blue-yellow palette across all subplots
  - Proper use of theme customization with shared base_theme for consistency
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with coherent metrics
  weaknesses:
  - Main title positioning overlaps slightly with Sales Trend subplot title - could
    benefit from more vertical spacing
  - The legend in the sales trend plot consumes plot area; consider positioning outside
  image_description: 'The plot displays a well-organized 2x2 grid layout showcasing
    a product performance dashboard:

    - **Top-left (Sales Trend)**: Line chart with two product series (A in blue, B
    in yellow) showing sales over 40 days. Points are connected by solid lines with
    dashed linear trend lines. Legend on the right shows "Product" with A and B entries.

    - **Top-right (Quarterly Revenue)**: Vertical bar chart with Q1-Q4 quarters. Bars
    gradient from dark blue (Q1=45) through lighter blues (Q2, Q3) to yellow (Q4=18).

    - **Bottom-left (Sales Distribution Product A)**: Histogram with ~8 blue bars
    showing frequency distribution of sales units, ranging roughly 85-130 units.

    - **Bottom-right (Units vs Margin)**: Scatter plot with blue points showing relationship
    between units sold (100-500) and profit margin (20-45%). Yellow regression line
    with light yellow confidence band.

    The main title "subplot-grid · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears prominently in bold
    at the top center. All text is legible with good contrast against white backgrounds.'
