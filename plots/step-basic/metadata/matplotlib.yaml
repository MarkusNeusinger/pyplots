review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the stair-step pattern using ax.step() with post style
  - Clear visual representation with well-sized markers highlighting each data point
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that perfectly matches spec applications
  - All text elements are properly sized for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper-left corner slightly overlaps with the lowest data region
  - Only demonstrates post step style; could showcase more step variations mentioned
    in spec
  - Could use fill_between to add visual distinction to the stepped area
