review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud metaphor execution with cloud above, box centered, rain below
    — correctly oriented horizontally
  - Outstanding data storytelling with three annotation callouts identifying baseline,
    fastest responses, and bimodal distribution
  - 'Sophisticated visual design: custom typography, subtle grid, shadow legend, refined
    color palette'
  - Strong data variety showing normal, tight, bimodal, and wide-spread distributions
  - Creative use of Highcharts polygon series and renderer labels for a chart type
    not natively supported
  weaknesses:
  - Blue (#306998) and cyan (#17BECF) for Control and Treatment C are somewhat similar
    and may cause colorblind accessibility issues — consider differentiating these
    more
  - Vertical spacing between categories creates large whitespace gaps, reducing canvas
    utilization
  - Legend duplicates entries (each category appears for both cloud and rain series)
    — consolidating would reduce clutter
  - Treatment C lacks an annotation, missing an opportunity to complete the data story
    (e.g., noting widest variability)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud chart with four experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) on the y-axis and
    Reaction Time (ms) on the x-axis, ranging from ~150 to ~650 ms. Each condition
    features three layered components: a half-violin KDE "cloud" extending above the
    category baseline, a white-filled box plot with dark median line centered on the
    baseline, and jittered scatter "rain" points below the baseline. Colors are blue
    (Control), yellow (Treatment A), purple (Treatment B), and cyan (Treatment C)
    — all with semi-transparent fills. Three annotation callout boxes highlight key
    insights: "Baseline" (Mean ~450 ms) for Control, "Fastest responses" (Mean ~380
    ms, tight spread) for Treatment A, and "Bimodal distribution" (Two distinct response
    clusters at ~350 ms and ~480 ms) for Treatment B. The title reads "raincloud-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Reaction Time Distributions Across
    Experimental Conditions". A legend in the top-right corner identifies cloud, rain,
    and box components along with category colors. Background is light gray (#fafafa)
    with subtle dotted gridlines.'
