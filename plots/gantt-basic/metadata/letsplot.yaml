  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper bar sizing and spacing between tasks
  - Smart use of geom_segment with square end markers for clean Gantt bar appearance
  - Professional color palette with 6 distinct phase colors
  - Well-structured realistic software development project data
  - Proper canvas sizing (1600x900 with scale=3) for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean week-based x-axis labeling making timeline easy to follow
  - Tasks logically sorted by start date for natural reading flow
  weaknesses:
  - Missing today marker (vertical reference line) which spec notes suggest
  - Blue and teal colors for Planning and Deployment phases could be more distinct
    for colorblind accessibility
  - Cleanup code for lets-plot-images folder adds unnecessary complexity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a professional Gantt chart for a software
    development project with 12 tasks displayed as horizontal bars. Tasks are listed
    vertically on the y-axis from "Requirements Gathering" at the top to "Deployment"
    at the bottom, sorted by start date (earliest first). The x-axis shows the project
    timeline labeled in weeks (Week 1 through Week 11) with angled labels. Each task
    bar is color-coded by category/phase using a 6-color palette: blue (Planning),
    purple (Design), green (Development), yellow/gold (Testing), red (Documentation),
    and teal (Deployment). The legend on the right side clearly identifies each phase.
    The title "gantt-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Task
    bars have square end markers and show varying durations and overlapping schedules
    representing a realistic software project timeline.'

        comment: '"Tasks" and "Project Timeline" are descriptive but generic; x-axis

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate, legend is well-placed, but vertical
          grid lines could be slightly more prominent for timeline reading

        comment: Good use of geom_segment for bars, scale_y_continuous with custom
          labels, theme customization. Could better leverage lets-plot's interactive
          HTML features or tooltip capabilities
