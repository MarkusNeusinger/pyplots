review:
  strengths:
  - Clear hierarchical layout showing software module dependencies in logical layers
  - Properly implemented directional arrows using custom SVG rendering
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme (yellow nodes, blue edges)
  - Fixed node positions ensure reproducibility across runs
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Realistic software architecture example that demonstrates practical use case
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels are readable but slightly small for the 4800x2700 canvas; increasing
    font size would improve legibility
  - Significant empty space on left and right margins - nodes could be spread wider
    to better utilize canvas
