review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all four decomposition components with clear visual
    separation
  - Uses statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper time series decomposition
  - Realistic CO2 data scenario with appropriate values and trends
  - Custom style configuration with proper font sizing for large canvas
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Clean color scheme with distinct, colorblind-friendly colors for each component
  - Y-axis labels properly rotated and positioned for each subplot
  - X-axis date labels only on bottom chart with appropriate rotation to prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure is complex due to pygal limitations with multi-panel layouts (requires
    PIL composition)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current alpha appears fully opaque)
  - Left margin y-axis label area could be slightly narrower for better canvas utilization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked subplots. The main title "timeseries-decomposition · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in dark text. Each subplot shows a different component:

    1. **Original Series (CO2 ppm)** - Blue line showing the raw CO2 measurements
    ranging from ~406-436 ppm with visible upward trend and oscillations

    2. **Trend Component** - Yellow/gold line showing the smooth upward trend from
    ~410 to ~430 ppm

    3. **Seasonal Component** - Green line showing the repeating annual cycle oscillating
    between approximately -3 and +3 ppm

    4. **Residual Component** - Red/coral line showing random noise fluctuating around
    zero between approximately -2 and +2 ppm


    Each subplot has its own y-axis label on the left side (CO₂ (ppm), Trend (ppm),
    Seasonal (ppm), Residual (ppm)). The bottom subplot includes x-axis date labels
    showing dates from 2020-01 to 2025-07 at 6-month intervals with 35-degree rotation.
    Light gray grid lines are present on all charts. The colors are distinct and colorblind-friendly.
    The layout effectively uses the canvas with balanced spacing.'

        comment: Uses pygal.Line with custom Style, SVG rendering, HTML output. Good
          use of pygal's SVG nature, though complex image composition workaround needed.
  verdict: APPROVED
