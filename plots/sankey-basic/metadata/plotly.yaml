review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly go.Sankey with proper node/link configuration
  - Well-chosen color scheme with source-based link coloring and appropriate transparency
  - Realistic energy distribution scenario that effectively demonstrates Sankey diagram
    purpose
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data organization
  - Proper output sizing (1600x900 scale=3) producing 4800x2700 target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Could include flow value labels on hover or annotations to show exact TWh values
  - Transportation sector only receives flows from Gas and Renewables, missing Coal
    and Nuclear contributions
