review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native Pyramid chart type for authentic population pyramid
    visualization
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow) with high contrast
  - Realistic US population data demonstrating pyramid shape and gender longevity
    differences
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement appears in top-left despite legend_at_bottom=True setting
  - Font sizes in custom_style deviate from library rules guide recommendations
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid showing US 2023 age-gender
    distribution. The chart uses a horizontal bar format with blue bars extending
    left for Male population and yellow/gold bars extending right for Female population.
    Age groups (0-9 through 80+) are labeled along the left vertical axis. The x-axis
    shows "Population (millions)" ranging from -8 to 8. The title "pyramid-basic ·
    pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend in the top-left corner
    identifies Female (yellow) and Male (blue). The pyramid shape clearly shows the
    bulge in middle-age groups (40-49 being widest) tapering toward both younger and
    older age groups.

        comment: Uses pygal.Pyramid which is the native chart type, but font sizes
          don't follow the library rules guide (recommends smaller font sizes). The
          implementation increases font sizes significantly beyond the documented
          guidelines.
  verdict: APPROVED
