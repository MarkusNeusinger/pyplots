review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native HistogramSeries with base_series pattern —
    idiomatic and distinctive
  - All font sizes explicitly set for the 4800x2700 canvas, ensuring perfect legibility
  - Realistic neutral data scenario with bimodal mixture distribution showing distribution
    shape variety
  - Clean linear code structure with proper seed and all spec requirements met
  - Contiguous bars with border highlighting provide clean histogram appearance
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the bimodal distribution (mixture of two normal distributions)
    is not annotated or highlighted — add mean/median lines, or annotate the two peaks
    to guide the viewer'
  - Visual refinement is mostly Highcharts defaults — consider adding plotBands for
    grade ranges (A/B/C/D/F), or a subtle background gradient, or removing unnecessary
    gridlines to polish the design
  - No annotations or callouts to interpret the data for the viewer — the subtitle
    helps but the chart body has no narrative elements
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of university exam score distribution
    using dark blue bars (#306998) with darker blue border outlines. The x-axis is
    labeled "Exam Score (points)" ranging from approximately 30 to 98, and the y-axis
    is labeled "Number of Students" ranging from 0 to 60. The title reads "Exam Score
    Distribution · histogram-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold black text,
    with a subtitle "500 students — Introduction to Statistics, Fall 2024" in gray.
    The distribution is slightly right-skewed with a primary peak around 73-80 (reaching
    ~53 students) and a visible secondary concentration around 85-90 reflecting the
    bimodal data mixture. Bars are contiguous with no gaps. Light gray horizontal
    gridlines are present. The background is white. All text is clearly readable at
    the rendered resolution.
