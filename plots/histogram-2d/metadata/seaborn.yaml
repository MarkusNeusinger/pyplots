review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn JointGrid to create marginal histograms alongside the
    2D heatmap
  - Viridis colormap is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended in
    spec
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Colorbar properly labeled with Count for density interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or more descriptive names
  - Layout could be slightly improved - the right marginal histogram appears somewhat
    cramped relative to the main plot
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D histogram heatmap showing a bivariate
    normal distribution with positive correlation. The main plot uses the viridis
    colormap (dark purple for low counts through green to yellow for high counts ~50).
    The central region shows the highest density (yellow/green) with density decreasing
    outward (purple). Marginal 1D histograms appear on the top (X distribution) and
    right (Y distribution) edges in a muted blue color (#306998). The title "histogram-2d
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at the top. Axis labels show "X Value"
    and "Y Value" with tick marks from approximately -4 to 4 on both axes. A colorbar
    on the right indicates count values from 0 to ~50.
