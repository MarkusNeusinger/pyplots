review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart concept with 3 bands per direction
  - Clear visual differentiation between positive (blue) and negative (red) deviations
  - Multiple time series displayed compactly in limited vertical space
  - Proper use of Highcharts multi-axis feature for panel layout
  - Good title format following spec requirements
  - Realistic server monitoring use case that aligns perfectly with spec applications
  - Clean, reproducible code with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python library as documented in library rules, instead
    builds JSON manually
  - Y-axis labels are hidden, making it harder to understand the magnitude scale
  - Color scheme while good is not the most colorblind-safe (tritanopia)
  - Subtitle legend could be more prominent or placed as a traditional legend
