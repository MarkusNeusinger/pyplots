review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all labels clearly readable at target resolution
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation with proper layer composition
  - Smart use of three distinct data patterns (correlation, high values, scattered)
    demonstrating categorical differences
  - Colorblind-safe palette choice with good contrast between categories
  - Realistic biological scenario (plant species growth vs temperature)
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like facet_wrap for small multiples
    or stat_smooth for trend lines
  - Legend title font size could be slightly larger for consistency with axis titles
