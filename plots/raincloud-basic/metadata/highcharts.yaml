review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud metaphor with cloud (KDE) clearly on right, boxplot centered,
    rain (points) on left - matching the spec layout requirement
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B is clearly visible in the KDE curve, demonstrating
    the advantage of raincloud plots
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each condition
  - Proper inline KDE computation with Gaussian kernel for the half-violin clouds
  - High-resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is overly cluttered with 9 entries (Cloud, Box Plot, and Points for each
    category) - could consolidate to show just the 4 condition names
  - Grid line styling could be more subtle to reduce visual noise
  image_description: 'The plot displays a raincloud visualization for four experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C). Each condition features
    three elements arranged horizontally: jittered scatter points ("rain") on the
    left in lighter shades, white boxplots with black outlines in the center showing
    median lines and whiskers, and half-violin KDE curves ("clouds") on the right
    in solid colors. The colorblind-safe palette uses blue for Control, yellow for
    Treatment A, purple for Treatment B, and cyan for Treatment C. Treatment B clearly
    shows a bimodal distribution in its cloud shape. The title "raincloud-basic ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, with axis labels "Experimental Condition"
    (x-axis) and "Reaction Time (ms)" (y-axis). A legend on the right categorizes
    all series.'
