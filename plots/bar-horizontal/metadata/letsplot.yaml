review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with coord_flip for horizontal bars
  - Clean professional appearance with theme_minimal and customized theme elements
  - Real-world programming language survey data with realistic values
  - Proper sorting (ascending) so largest bars appear at top when displayed
  - Correct high-resolution export with scale=3 for 4800x2700 px output
  - Good use of pd.Categorical to preserve sort order
  weaknesses:
  - Grid customization could be slightly more refined with lower alpha for vertical
    grid lines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing programming
    language popularity among developers. Ten programming languages are listed on
    the y-axis (from bottom to top: Rust, Go, C, PHP, C++, C#, TypeScript, Java, Python,
    JavaScript), sorted by popularity in ascending order. The x-axis shows "Developers
    (%)" ranging from 0 to 65. All bars use a consistent steel blue color (#306998).
    JavaScript leads at ~65%, followed by Python at ~49%. The title "bar-horizontal
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The chart uses a minimal
    theme with light gray vertical grid lines and no horizontal grid lines, providing
    a clean, professional appearance.'
