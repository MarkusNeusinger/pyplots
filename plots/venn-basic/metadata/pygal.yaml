review:
  strengths:
  - All 7 Venn diagram regions are correctly calculated and labeled with accurate
    counts
  - Good color palette (Python blue, yellow, green) with appropriate opacity for overlaps
  - Count labels are well-positioned within each region for clear identification
  - Uses clever approach with XY chart to draw circles since pygal lacks native Venn
    support
  - Produces both SVG and PNG outputs with interactive HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - Set name labels (Product A and Product B) are cut off at the top corners of the
    image - need to adjust label positioning or increase top margin
  - Legend at bottom is relatively small compared to the chart size
