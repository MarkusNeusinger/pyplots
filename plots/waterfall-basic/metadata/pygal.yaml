review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using StackedBar with invisible spacers to achieve waterfall
    effect
  - Correct floating bar positioning with proper cumulative calculations
  - 'Good color coding: blue totals, green increases, red decreases'
  - Clean financial scenario with realistic quarterly breakdown data
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing connecting lines between bars (spec requirement)
  - Missing running total labels on or near bars (spec requirement)
  - Red/green color scheme is not colorblind-friendly; consider blue/orange or other
    accessible palette
  - Legend text at bottom is relatively small compared to the large canvas
