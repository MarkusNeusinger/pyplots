review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Titanic dataset - classic, relatable, and perfect for demonstrating
    parallel categories
  - Clean 4-dimension flow visualization (Class → Sex → Age Group → Outcome)
  - Good color scheme with distinct colors per dimension and colorblind-safe palette
  - Proper use of Highcharts Sankey with column positioning for parallel categories
    structure
  - Comprehensive node labeling with display name mapping
  - Subtitle clearly explains the data flow
  weaknesses:
  - Some small flow ribbons (e.g., children who died in 1st class) are barely visible
  - Right-edge labels (Survived, Died) appear slightly cramped due to narrow outcome
    ribbons
  - Interactive features mentioned in spec (highlighting paths) not demonstrable in
    static PNG output
