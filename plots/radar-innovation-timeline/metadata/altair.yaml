review:
  strengths:
  - Sophisticated 270-degree radar layout with graduated ring fills and subtle concentric
    arc/spoke styling creates a polished, professional appearance
  - Dual encoding (color for sector, shape for ring) provides redundant information
    channels, improving both aesthetics and accessibility
  - Interactive hover selection with conditional sizing and tooltips leverages Altair's
    distinctive declarative interaction grammar
  - Excellent, realistic data with 25 current technology items and sensible ring/sector
    placements
  weaknesses:
  - Item labels at 16pt fontSize could be increased to 18-20pt for stronger legibility
    on a 3600x3600 canvas
  - Minor label crowding in inner rings where sectors contain multiple Adopt items
    — additional angular or radial jittering could help separate overlapping labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree (three-quarter circle) innovation
    radar chart on a white background. Four concentric rings represent time horizons:
    Adopt (innermost, darkest blue tint), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost, lightest
    tint). Four angular sectors divide the arc: Data Engineering (upper-left), Cloud
    & Infra (upper-right), Security (lower-left), and AI & ML (lower-right), each
    labeled with bold sector headers beyond the outer ring. 25 technology items are
    plotted as filled markers with white strokes — circles for Adopt, diamonds for
    Trial, triangles for Assess, and squares for Hold. Colors encode sectors: blue
    (#306998) for AI & ML, orange (#E07A2F) for Cloud & Infra, green (#2CA02C) for
    Data Engineering, purple (#9467BD) for Security. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess,
    Hold) appear in the bottom gap. A horizontal legend at the bottom maps colors
    to sectors and shapes to rings. The title reads "radar-innovation-timeline · altair
    · pyplots.ai" at the top center. Gray spokes separate sectors and gray concentric
    arcs separate rings. Labels are positioned outward from each marker with alternating
    offsets. Some crowding is visible in inner rings where sectors have multiple Adopt/Trial
    items.'

        comment: All font sizes explicitly set (title 28pt, sector headers 22pt, labels
