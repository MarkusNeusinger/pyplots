quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen color contrast (blue boxes, yellow points)
  - Proper use of outlier_alpha=0 to hide box plot outliers since strip shows all
    points
  - Good jitter width (0.15) that keeps points within their category while reducing
    overlap
  - Realistic business scenario with thoughtfully varied distributions per department
  - Clean ggplot2-style code that is easy to read and modify
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Performance Score lacks units (could be Performance Score (%) or similar)
  - Output path uses __file__ which may cause issues in some execution contexts
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features for HTML output (tooltips showing
    exact values)
  image_description: The plot displays a box plot with strip overlay showing Performance
    Score (y-axis, range 35-100) across four departments (Engineering, Marketing,
    Sales, Support) on the x-axis. Each department has a blue (#306998) box showing
    quartiles with a dark median line, and yellow (#FFD43B) jittered points overlaid
    on top representing individual data points. The title "cat-box-strip · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed in bold at the top. The background is clean with minimal
    grid (only horizontal lines), and text is clearly legible. Engineering shows high
    performers (~95-97) and one low outlier (~42). Marketing has wider spread. Sales
    has two low outliers (~35-38). Support shows a tighter distribution.

        comment: Points are well-sized (size=4) with good alpha (0.7), jitter prevents

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar (ggplot + geom_boxplot + geom_jitter), theme_minimal(),
          element_text/element_blank for styling. Could leverage more lets-plot specific
