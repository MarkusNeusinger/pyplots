review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a 4x4 scatter matrix with linked brushing across all
    panels
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with consistent species encoding
  - 'Proper interactive features: click selection, Ctrl+click multi-select, double-click
    clear, zoom/pan'
  - Histograms on diagonal provide good univariate distribution context
  - Uses real Iris dataset which is perfect for demonstrating multivariate exploration
  - HTML output enables full interactivity; PNG capture for static preview
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library as recommended in library rules;
    instead constructs raw JavaScript/HTML
  - Box/lasso selection not implemented (only point-click selection available)
  - Interaction instructions at bottom are somewhat small text
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) for the Iris dataset with linked brushing functionality. The title "scatter-matrix-interactive · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at the top with a subtitle describing the dataset. The matrix shows all pairwise combinations of four Iris features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

    The diagonal cells contain histograms showing univariate distributions for each variable, with three colors representing the three species: blue (Setosa), yellow (Versicolor), and purple (Virginica). Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots of variable pairs, with the same color scheme consistently applied across all plots.

    The layout includes a legend at the bottom with circular color indicators for each species. Instructions for interaction are displayed below the legend. Axis labels appear on the left side (Y) and bottom (X) edges of the matrix. The grid lines are subtle gray. Points appear reasonably sized for the 150 data points.
