review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot and kdeplot functions separately for fine-grained
    control over colors
  - Realistic stock returns scenario with mixture of normal, volatile, and bullish
    periods
  - Perfect color contrast between blue histogram and yellow KDE curve
  - Proper density scaling so histogram and KDE are on comparable scales
  - Clean visual design with removed top/right spines
  weaknesses:
  - No legend to explicitly identify the histogram bars vs KDE curve
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram with KDE overlay showing daily
    stock returns (%). The histogram uses blue semi-transparent bars (#306998) with
    white edges, showing the frequency distribution of returns centered around 0%.
    A smooth yellow/gold KDE curve (#FFD43B) overlays the histogram, highlighting
    the underlying probability density. The x-axis shows "Daily Return (%)" ranging
    from approximately -8 to +8, and the y-axis shows "Density" ranging from 0.00
    to 0.35. The title follows the correct format: "histogram-kde · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    The distribution is roughly bell-shaped with slight left skewness, visible tail
    behavior on both ends, and the KDE smoothly traces the shape of the histogram
    bars. Top and right spines are removed for a cleaner look, and a subtle dashed
    grid is present.'
