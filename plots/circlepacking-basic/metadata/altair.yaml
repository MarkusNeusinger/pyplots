review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic business scenario with company budget allocation across departments
    and teams
  - Proper area-proportional sizing calculation using sqrt transformation
  - Good layered approach using Altair chart composition for depth-based rendering
  - Correct title format matching spec requirements
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Interactive tooltips implemented for additional data exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Circle overlap is severe - circles from different departments overlap significantly,
    violating the spec requirement for efficient packing without overlap
  - Department color differentiation not working in output - all circles appear the
    same blue color despite distinct colors defined in code
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output despite being coded
  - Department parent labels not visible on the visualization
  - Code uses helper functions (get_team_radius, pack_circles_in_parent) which violates
    the KISS principle of no functions/classes
