review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D isometric projection with proper painter's algorithm for correct
    face ordering
  - Semi-transparency (alpha=0.75) effectively reveals occluded bars as spec recommends
  - Viridis color gradient reinforces z-values for better depth perception per spec
  - Face shading (top=100%, front=85%, right=70%) provides convincing 3D appearance
  - Clean axis labels positioned correctly in 3D space
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation in data
  weaknesses:
  - Title format uses hyphens/dashes instead of middle dots as required by SC-06
