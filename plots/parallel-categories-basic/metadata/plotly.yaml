review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Titanic dataset providing realistic, well-known categorical data
    with meaningful dimensions
  - Clear color scheme with blue/yellow contrast that is colorblind-friendly
  - Good use of Plotly Parcats with smooth hspline ribbons and interactive hover features
  - Title follows correct format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Helpful annotation explaining color meaning at the bottom of the plot
  weaknesses:
  - The Did Not Survive label on the right side is slightly cut off - consider adjusting
    margins or abbreviating
