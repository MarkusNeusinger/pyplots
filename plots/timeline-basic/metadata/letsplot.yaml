review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents overlap
  - Clean implementation of timeline using ggplot grammar (geom_segment + geom_point
    + geom_text)
  - Good color palette with 5 distinct phases clearly differentiated
  - Realistic software project milestone data that is easy to understand
  - Proper title format and legend placement
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Red and green colors for Testing and Development could be improved for colorblind
    accessibility
  - Event label text size (size=9) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - X-axis label 2024 is unconventional - consider moving year to title or using a
    more descriptive label
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization for a
    software project spanning January to December 2024. A dark gray horizontal line
    serves as the main axis at y=0. Ten events are shown as colored circular markers
    connected to the axis by vertical segments. Events alternate above and below the
    axis to prevent label overlap. The title "timeline-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left in bold. Event labels (e.g., "Project Kickoff", "Requirements
    Done", "Design Review", etc.) are positioned above or below their respective markers.
    A legend on the right shows five color-coded phases: Planning (blue), Design (yellow),
    Development (green), Testing (red), and Release (purple). The x-axis shows month
    abbreviations (Jan-Dec) with "2024" as the axis label. The overall layout is clean
    with a light/white background and subtle minimal theming.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar properly with geom_segment, geom_point, geom_text,
          scale_color_manual, theme_minimal. Good use of layering but does not leverage
          lets-plot interactive features in the static output.
  verdict: APPROVED
