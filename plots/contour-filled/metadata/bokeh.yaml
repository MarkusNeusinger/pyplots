review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with the Viridis colormap providing clear elevation gradients
  - High-contrast contour lines (white with dark outline) that are visible across
    all elevation levels
  - Realistic terrain elevation scenario with multiple peaks and a valley
  - Proper axis labels with units (km, m)
  - Colorbar is well-positioned with appropriate title
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too prominent (alpha 0.6 should be reduced to 0.2-0.4 for subtlety)
  - Does not leverage bokeh's distinctive interactive features - the HTML output would
    benefit from hover tooltips showing elevation values
