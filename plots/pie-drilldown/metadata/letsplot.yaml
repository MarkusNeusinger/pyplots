review:
  strengths:
  - Well-designed colorblind-safe color palette with consistent color families for
    subcategories
  - Clean donut chart design with appropriate hole size and white slice borders
  - Comprehensive hierarchical data structure supporting 2 levels of drill-down
  - Interactive HTML includes breadcrumb navigation, back button, and hover effects
    as specified
  - Realistic business data scenario (company budget breakdown)
  weaknesses:
  - Label overlap between Engineering and Human Resources on left side needs better
    positioning
  - Interactive drilldown implemented as custom JavaScript rather than using lets-plot
    native features
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the drilldown functionality which is the core spec
    requirement
