review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between historical (solid blue) and forecast (dashed
    orange) lines
  - Nested confidence bands with appropriate opacity (0.2 and 0.35) allow clear layering
  - Vertical rule clearly marks the forecast transition point
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Uses Altair declarative layer composition effectively
  - Realistic monthly sales data with trend and seasonality
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend - the specification explicitly requires a clear legend identifying
    historical data, forecast, and confidence levels
  - Y-axis scale starts at 0 creating wasted space - data lives in 100-250 range so
    40% of vertical space is unused
  - Legend data DataFrame is created but never used in the chart
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series forecast visualization on a
    white background. The historical data (Jan 2021 - Dec 2023) is shown as a solid
    blue line (#306998) with clear seasonal patterns and an upward trend, starting
    around 105 and ending around 170 thousand USD. A vertical dashed gray line marks
    the forecast start at January 2024. The forecast period (Jan 2024 - Dec 2024)
    shows an orange dashed line (#E67E22) with two nested confidence bands: a darker
    yellow/amber band for 80% CI and a lighter yellow band for 95% CI. The bands widen
    over the forecast horizon as expected. The title "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top with a subtitle "Monthly
    Sales with 80% and 95% Confidence Intervals". Axes are clearly labeled with "Date"
    on X-axis and "Sales (thousands USD)" on Y-axis. All text is legible and well-sized.'
