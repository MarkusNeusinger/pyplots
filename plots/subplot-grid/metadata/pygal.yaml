review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of pygal versatility with four distinct chart types (Line,
    Bar, XY scatter, Histogram) in a cohesive grid
  - Creative solution for subplot grid using PIL composition since pygal lacks native
    subplots
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with interconnected metrics (revenue, sales,
    advertising ROI, order volume)
  - 'Proper use of Python brand colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) maintaining
    visual consistency'
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated, showcasing pygal web-native SVG
    capabilities
  - Clean, readable axis labels with appropriate units throughout all subplots
  weaknesses:
  - Chart titles repeat y-axis information (e.g., Monthly Revenue title + Revenue
    y-label) - could be more concise
  - Scatter plot dots could be slightly larger for improved visibility at the 30-point
    density level
  - Code structure uses loops for chart rendering which adds slight complexity beyond
    pure KISS style
