review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent asymmetric error bar visualization with clear visual distinction between
    upper and lower bounds
  - Professional financial forecasting context that perfectly demonstrates asymmetric
    uncertainty
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper use of ColumnDataSource
  - Good color contrast between yellow markers and blue error bars
  - Appropriate use of Bokeh's Whisker model for error bar rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears smaller than optimal relative to the large canvas size
  - Manual cap implementation could leverage Bokeh's built-in Whisker head customization
    more elegantly
