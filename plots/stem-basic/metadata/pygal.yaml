review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of stem plot using XY chart with None separators between
    vertical line segments
  - Correct decaying oscillation data pattern demonstrating impulse response (realistic
    signal processing application)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Appropriate color scheme and canvas sizing (4800×2700)
  - No text overlap and good overall layout
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label in rendered image shows only Amplitude without the [a.u.] units specified
    in code
  - Stem lines are quite thin making them less prominent than ideal for a stem plot
  - Dots at data points could be larger for better visibility as stem plot markers
