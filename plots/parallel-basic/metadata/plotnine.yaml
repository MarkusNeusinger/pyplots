review:
  strengths:
  - Clean grammar-of-graphics implementation using geom_line and geom_point for parallel
    coordinates
  - Proper data normalization to 0-1 scale for fair comparison across dimensions
  - Excellent colorblind-accessible palette with Python Blue, Yellow, and Red
  - Well-sized text elements with appropriate font sizes for readability
  - Uses Iris dataset - a classic and realistic multi-dimensional example
  weaknesses:
  - Uneven species distribution (20/20/10) could be balanced as 50 samples equally
    distributed
  - Legend title could use a more specific label than generic Species
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization with
    four vertical axes representing Iris flower measurements: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal
    Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). The Y-axis shows normalized
    values from 0 to 1. Three species are color-coded: Setosa in steel blue (#306998),
    Versicolor in golden yellow (#FFD43B), and Virginica in coral red (#E74C3C). Each
    observation is represented by a line connecting its values across the four dimensions,
    with small circular markers at each axis intersection. The plot clearly shows
    species clustering - Setosa (blue) clusters low on petal measurements while having
    varied sepal measurements, Versicolor (yellow) occupies the middle range, and
    Virginica (red) shows the highest values for petal dimensions. The title "parallel-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, and a legend is positioned on the
    right side.'

  verdict: APPROVED
