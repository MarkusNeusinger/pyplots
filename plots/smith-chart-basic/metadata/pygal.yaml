review:
  strengths:
  - Mathematically correct Smith chart implementation with proper impedance-to-reflection
    coefficient conversion
  - Good use of the square format (3600x3600) appropriate for circular chart geometry
  - Realistic RF engineering scenario with antenna impedance sweep
  - Clear visual distinction between grid elements (gray dashed) and data (red)
  - Frequency markers well-differentiated with distinct colors (purple, yellow, green)
  - Proper normalization to 50 ohm reference impedance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is truncated/cut off, making frequency marker labels partially
    unreadable
  - Legend text appears too small relative to the chart size
  - Grid lines and data elements could be more visually prominent given the large
    canvas size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance visualization.
    A blue circular boundary represents the unit circle (|Γ|=1). Gray dashed lines
    show the constant resistance circles and constant reactance arcs forming the characteristic
    Smith chart grid pattern. A dark gray horizontal line represents the real axis.
    The main data series "Antenna Z(f)" is plotted in red/coral color as a connected
    locus curve with small dots at each data point, showing the impedance trajectory
    across frequency. Three frequency marker points are highlighted: a purple/violet
    dot at "1 GHz" (upper left region around -0.1, 0.3), a yellow/gold dot at "3.5
    GHz" (right center area around 0.1, 0.1), and a green dot at "6 GHz" (lower center
    around 0.05, -0.45). The title "smith-chart-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at top center. Axis labels read "Reflection Coefficient Real Part" (x-axis) and
    "Reflection Coefficient Imaginary Part" (y-axis). A legend at the bottom shows
    all series. The chart uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio appropriate for the circular
    Smith chart geometry.'
