review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical structure with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart text coloring (white on dark backgrounds, black on light) improves readability
  - Appropriate use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_rect and geom_text
  - Clean color palette with Python-branded blues and distinct hierarchy levels
  - Good adaptive labeling that shows name+value for wide rectangles and hides labels
    for narrow ones
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only levels 0-3 but the chart includes level 4 nodes (brown rectangles
    like Backend, Frontend, etc.)
  - Some leaf-level labels are truncated (Frontend, Config show only names, no MB
    values) while similar-width rectangles elsewhere show both
