review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of silhouette analysis with clear cluster separation
  - 'Proper implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, cluster grouping,
    average line, and cluster annotations'
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic Iris dataset scenario with 3 clusters showing diverse silhouette characteristics
  - Interactive tooltip configured for hover information
  - Cluster background bands effectively distinguish cluster regions
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis (silhouette coefficient axis) label text not visible in the rendered image
  - Y-axis label font could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full resolution
  - Legend text could be larger for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a silhouette visualization for a 3-cluster
    K-means solution on the Iris dataset. Three distinct color-coded clusters are
    shown with horizontal bars representing individual sample silhouette scores:

    - **Cluster 0 (blue)**: 50 samples at top with Avg: 0.758 - consistently high
    scores indicating well-separated cluster

    - **Cluster 1 (yellow)**: 50 samples in middle with Avg: 0.555 - moderate scores
    showing decent separation

    - **Cluster 2 (purple)**: 50 samples at bottom with Avg: 0.361 - lower scores
    with visible negative values indicating some overlap/misclassification


    A vertical dashed red line marks the average silhouette score (0.558) with label.
    Title follows the correct format "silhouette-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai".
    Subtitle shows "Iris Dataset Clustering (K=3) | Average Silhouette Score: 0.558".
    Y-axis labeled "Samples (sorted by silhouette score within cluster)". Light background
    bands distinguish cluster regions. Legend positioned on right side showing sample
    counts.'
