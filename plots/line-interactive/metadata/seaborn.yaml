review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with annotated extreme weather events (heat wave, cold
    snap)
  - Creative demonstration of interactivity through static representation (tooltip
    demo, zoom region highlight, controls footer)
  - Realistic and engaging temperature dataset with seasonal patterns
  - Good use of color coding to distinguish different data features
  - Clear and informative legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Missing range selector/slider functionality specified in the requirements
  - Double grid effect from whitegrid theme combined with explicit grid call is slightly
    redundant
  - The decorator function for mplcursors callback violates strict KISS no functions
    rule
