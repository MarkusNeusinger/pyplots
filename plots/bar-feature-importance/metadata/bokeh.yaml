  - Proper sorting with highest importance at top for easy scanning
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource pattern for data binding
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh web capabilities

  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive exploration in HTML output (Bokeh key strength)
  - Y-axis label could be added (Feature or Model Feature)
