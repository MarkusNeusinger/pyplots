review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom beeswarm algorithm that effectively spreads points to avoid overlap
    while maintaining visual clarity
  - Good use of mean diamond markers to show central tendency for each group as suggested
    in the spec
  - Thoughtful data design showing varied distribution shapes (bimodal, wide spread,
    tight clusters)
  - Clean, readable code structure with proper comments
  - Correct title format and proper output sizing (4800x2700 via scale=3)
  - Well-designed hover templates showing classroom and score
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Plotly's distinctive features like violin mode, built-in jitter,
    or advanced interactivity beyond basic hover
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Test Score (points)" or similar)
  - Legend placement has slight isolation from the main plot area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm plot showing student test scores across
    4 classrooms (Room A through Room D). Each classroom has its own color: Room A
    in dark blue (#306998), Room B in yellow (#FFD43B), Room C in light blue (#5A9BD4),
    and Room D in orange (#E07B39). Individual data points are displayed as circular
    markers with dark outlines, spread horizontally to avoid overlap. Each classroom
    includes a white diamond marker indicating the mean score. The title "swarm-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Classroom" with
    category labels, and the y-axis shows "Test Score" ranging from approximately
    40-100. A legend on the right identifies each classroom color. The plot uses a
    clean white template with subtle gridlines.'

        comment: Implements beeswarm algorithm manually instead of using plotly's
          built-in jitter or a violin plot overlay. Does not leverage plotly's distinctive
          interactive features in an interesting way
  verdict: APPROVED
