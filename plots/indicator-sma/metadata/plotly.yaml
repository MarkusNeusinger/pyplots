review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features with custom hover templates showing
    formatted date and price
  - Clean, professional visual appearance with appropriate line weights and colors
  - Proper handling of SMA calculation windows resulting in natural NaN handling for
    early periods
  - Well-structured data generation creating realistic price movement with trend and
    volatility
  - Correct title format and professional legend positioning with semi-transparent
    background
  weaknesses:
  - Legend slightly overlaps early price data points in upper-left region
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (consider blue/orange instead
    of blue/green)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicator chart
    with price data spanning from January 2025 to January 2026. The main close price
    line is displayed in blue (#306998) with noticeable volatility. Three SMA overlays
    are shown: SMA 20 in yellow/gold (#FFD43B), SMA 50 in red (#E74C3C), and SMA 200
    in green (#2ECC71). The price starts around $150, dips to approximately $110 mid-year,
    then rises to peak near $180 before declining again. The SMA 200 (green) only
    appears from around September 2025 due to the 200-day calculation window. The
    chart has a clean white background with subtle gray gridlines. The legend is positioned
    in the upper-left corner with a semi-transparent white background. Axes are clearly
    labeled with "Date" on x-axis and "Price ($)" on y-axis. The title follows the
    correct format: "indicator-sma · plotly · pyplots.ai".'
