review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with bimodal Sales distribution showcasing KDE ability to
    reveal distribution shapes
  - Realistic salary context with plausible values across departments
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles with proper modern seaborn
    API usage
  - Good text sizing with all font sizes explicitly set and currency formatting on
    y-axis
  weaknesses:
  - Monochromatic blue palette lacks differentiation and visual interest
  - No visual emphasis or annotation highlighting the bimodal Sales distribution
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive features like split violins or swarmplot
    overlay
  - Design is competent but not publication-ready
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots showing salary distributions
    across four departments: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Support. Each violin
    uses a shade of blue from a monochromatic palette (#306998, #4A90C4, #2D5F8A,
    #5BA3D9). The violins are mirrored with kernel density estimation on both sides
    and contain internal box plots showing quartile markers (dark boxes) and median
    lines (white dots). The y-axis is labeled "Salary ($)" with currency-formatted
    tick labels ranging from $40k to $120k. The x-axis shows "Department" with the
    four category labels. The title reads "violin-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at
    the top center. Engineering has the tallest, highest-centered violin (~$85k median).
    Marketing is centered around ~$75k. Sales shows a distinctive bimodal shape with
    two visible peaks (~$55k and ~$90k), demonstrating the KDE strength for revealing
    distribution shapes. Support is the lowest and narrowest, centered around ~$55k.
    Top and right spines are removed, and a subtle y-axis grid (alpha=0.2) provides
    reference lines. The violins are clipped at the data range (cut=0).'

        comment: inner='box' and cut=0 are seaborn-specific but commonly used. No
          split violins or layered swarmplot/stripplot overlay.
  verdict: REJECTED
