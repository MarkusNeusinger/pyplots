review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Renko chart algorithm with correct brick generation
    logic
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Professional visual appearance with proper sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Correct title format and comprehensive legend
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme may be challenging for colorblind users (consider blue/orange
    alternative)
  - Grid lines slightly more prominent than ideal (alpha could be reduced)
  image_description: The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 70 bricks
    showing price movements over a simulated stock price series. Green bricks represent
    bullish (upward) price movements and red bricks represent bearish (downward) movements.
    The chart shows clear trend patterns - an initial uptrend from ~$100 to ~$111,
    followed by a significant downtrend to ~$83, then recovery with volatile price
    action, and finally another uptrend reaching ~$113 near index 60. The X-axis shows
    "Brick Index" (0-70), the Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from $82-$114. A legend
    on the right identifies bullish (green) and bearish (red) directions. The title
    correctly displays "renko-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The bricks are uniform
    in size ($2 each) with white borders providing clear separation. A subtle grid
    helps identify price levels.
