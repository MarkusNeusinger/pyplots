review:
  strengths:
  - Correct polar bar/wind rose implementation using coord_polar
  - Good color differentiation across 8 compass directions
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate use of lets-plot grammar of graphics features (geom_bar + coord_polar)
  - Well-formatted title following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label shows Frequency (%) but data appears to be absolute counts not percentages
  - Direction labels (NE, SE) positioned outside the plot area - could be more integrated
  - Consider adding radial gridlines for easier magnitude reading
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar bar chart (wind rose) with 8 compass
    directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) arranged in a circle. Each direction has
    a colored bar extending outward from the center, with bar length representing
    frequency. The colors used are: N (blue), NE (light blue), E (yellow), SE (orange),
    S (purple), SW (dark purple), W (green), NW (lighter green). The title "polar-bar
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis is labeled "Frequency
    (%)" with gridlines at intervals of 2 from 0 to 22. Direction labels are placed
    around the outside of the chart. The W direction has the longest bar (~22), followed
    by SW (~18), N (~15), and NW (~14). SE has the shortest bar (~5).'

        comment: Grid is subtle (good), but legend is hidden - while direction labels
          around chart serve this purpose, the label positioning could be better integrated
