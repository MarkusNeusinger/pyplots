review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density representation
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled text
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Correctly transposed histogram for proper orientation
  - Grid disabled appropriately for heatmap visualization
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) instead of contextual labels with units
  - Could add HoverTool to show bin counts on mouseover for the HTML version
  - Data scenario could be more realistic (e.g., financial returns, physics measurements)
