review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive capabilities with custom JavaScript for drilldown
    navigation
  - Professional colorblind-safe color scheme with consistent subcategory shades
  - Robust JSON serialization for data passing to JavaScript (no fragile string replacement)
  - Clear breadcrumb navigation and user instructions
  - Clean donut style with center annotation adds modern aesthetic
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) maximizes utility
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap between breadcrumb annotation and Marketing slice label in
    top-left area
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the drilldown functionality - consider adjusting
    breadcrumb position to avoid overlap
