  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot syntax
  - Value labels inside segments using geom_text with position_stack(vjust=0.5) enhances
    readability
  - Proper categorical ordering ensures consistent stacking with largest category
    at bottom
  - Set2 qualitative palette correctly specified with type=qual
  - Good text sizing hierarchy (24pt title, 20pt axis labels, 16pt tick labels)
  - Clean minimal theme with subtle grid lines
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses alpha parameter which may not render consistently
  - Legend title Product Category is inconsistent with column name Category
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart with 4 bars representing
    Q1-Q4 on the x-axis. Each bar contains 4 stacked segments representing product
    categories: Electronics (pink/magenta at bottom), Clothing (blue/purple), Home
    (orange), and Sports (green/teal at top). White value labels are centered within
    each segment showing individual sales values. The y-axis shows "Sales (thousands
    USD)" ranging from 0 to ~175. The title "bar-stacked · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in bold. A legend on the right identifies each category.
    The bars show progression with Q4 having the tallest total stack.'

          theme_minimal. Good use of plotnine idioms but nothing exceptionally distinctive
  verdict: APPROVED
