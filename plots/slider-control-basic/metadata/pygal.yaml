review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent HTML implementation with functional slider control, year display, and
    smooth transitions between years
  - Good use of pygal SVG capabilities to pre-render charts for each year in the HTML
    version
  - Clean, well-organized code with realistic seasonal sales data showing year-over-year
    growth
  - Proper use of fixed y-axis range (0-220) for consistent comparison across years
    in the interactive version
  - Nice styling with custom colors, value formatting, and professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - PNG preview shows grouped bar chart with ALL years instead of single-year view
    with slider indication - fundamentally misrepresents the slider-control spec
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate the core slider functionality that defines this
    plot type
