review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style layer composition with multiple geom
    layers
  - Beautiful visual design with distinct markers for min (white), max (yellow), and
    midpoint (red)
  - Realistic temperature data showing seasonal variation and varying range sizes
  - Proper categorical ordering preserved with pd.Categorical
  - Correct canvas sizing (1600x900 base with scale=3 for 4800x2700)
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain what the different marker types represent (min/max/midpoint)
  image_description: The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges (°C) across all 12 months. Each month is represented by a thick blue vertical
    segment spanning from the minimum to maximum temperature. The minimum endpoints
    are marked with white-filled circular markers (hollow appearance), while maximum
    endpoints have yellow-filled circular markers. Small red diamond-shaped markers
    indicate the midpoint temperature for each month. The data shows a realistic seasonal
    pattern with winter months (Jan, Feb, Dec) having ranges around -2°C to 8°C, and
    summer months (Jun, Jul, Aug) peaking at 26-29°C. The chart uses a minimal theme
    with subtle gray gridlines and clear axis labels with units.
