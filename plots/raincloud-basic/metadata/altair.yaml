review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud visualization with all three components (half-violin, boxplot,
    jittered points) correctly positioned
  - 'Outstanding data quality: includes bimodal distribution (Treatment B) that demonstrates
    the key advantage of raincloud plots over simple boxplots'
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - Correct title format following the specification
  - Clean, reproducible code with proper random seed
  - Interactive features enabled for HTML output
  - Realistic reaction time data that tells a coherent scientific story
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are quite subtle (alpha 0.3) making them barely visible
  - Jittered points could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
