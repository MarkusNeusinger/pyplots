review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggbunch to combine three separate plots into a cohesive composite
    visualization
  - Clean axis alignment between main scatter and marginal plots using shared limits
  - Both histogram and KDE overlay in marginals provides comprehensive distribution
    view
  - Good color scheme with colorblind-safe blue points and contrasting red KDE curves
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output (24/20/16 pt hierarchy)
  - Reproducible with fixed seed
  weaknesses:
  - Title placement is unconventional - appears between top histogram and main scatter
    rather than at very top
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without real-world context or units
  - Right marginal histogram extends slightly past main plot area creating minor misalignment
    at bottom
