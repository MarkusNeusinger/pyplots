review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Andrews curves mathematical transformation with
    correct Fourier expansion
  - Perfect use of the Iris dataset as a canonical multivariate example demonstrating
    clear cluster separation
  - Good application of StandardScaler for normalization as recommended in the specification
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4) reveals density patterns where curves overlap
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good distinction between species
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated, leveraging Bokeh dual output capability
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (andrews_curve) which deviates from strict KISS structure;
    the Fourier computation could be vectorized inline
  - Legend background could have slightly higher opacity for better readability
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive features like hover tooltips which would enhance
    the visualization
