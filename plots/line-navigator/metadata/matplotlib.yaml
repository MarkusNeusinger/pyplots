review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the navigator concept with clear main/navigator
    separation
  - Selection window with yellow highlight and gray-out of non-selected regions is
    intuitive
  - Date range annotation provides clear context for the selected period
  - Realistic synthetic data with trend, seasonality, and noise patterns
  - Proper 4:1 height ratio between main chart and navigator
  weaknesses:
  - Navigator panel lacks grid lines, breaking visual consistency with main chart
  - Navigator y-axis label "Temp" could match main chart's "Temperature (°C)" for
    consistency
  - Could benefit from more descriptive title context
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a line chart with a mini navigator at the bottom. The main chart (upper panel, ~80% height) shows temperature readings in °C over approximately 4 months (Feb 2023 to Jun 2023), with values ranging from 24°C to 34°C. The line is rendered in blue (#306998) with a light blue fill below it. A dashed gray grid provides visual reference. The title "line-navigator · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. In the upper right corner, a white box with blue border displays "Selected: 2023-02-05 to 2023-06-04".

    The navigator panel (lower, ~20% height) shows the full 3-year dataset (2022-01 to 2024-12) with the complete temperature time series. The selected region is highlighted with a yellow (#FFD43B) semi-transparent rectangle and yellow vertical lines marking the selection edges. Non-selected regions are grayed out. A "Navigator" label appears in the upper left of this panel. The x-axis shows "Date" and the y-axis shows "Temp".

        comment: Uses subplots with height_ratios, patches, fill_between, axvspan,
          annotations - good library usage but no advanced features like widgets/sliders
