review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap providing colorblind-safe visualization
  - Multiple Gaussian peaks and valley demonstrate full capability of filled contours
  - Contour labels with white text provide precise value identification
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Correct aspect ratio with scaleanchor maintaining square coordinate system
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated as expected for Plotly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) without units or more descriptive
    context
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hovertemplate to show
    (x, y, z) values on interaction
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization of a 2D scalar
    field with multiple Gaussian features. The color scheme uses the Viridis colormap,
    transitioning from dark blue/purple (low values around -0.8) through teal and
    green to bright yellow (high values around 1.8). Two prominent peaks appear: a
    bright yellow peak in the upper right quadrant around (1, 1) and a green-yellow
    peak in the lower left quadrant around (-1, -1). There is also a smaller teal
    peak in the upper left and a purple valley (negative values) in the lower right
    quadrant around (1, -1). White contour lines with numeric labels (0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
    etc.) overlay the filled regions. The title reads "contour-filled · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    at the top, with "X Coordinate" and "Y Coordinate" axis labels. A vertical colorbar
    titled "Surface Value" appears on the right side. The aspect ratio is maintained
    as square within the plotting area.'

        passed: false
        comment: While the implementation is correct, it does not leverage Plotly's
          distinctive interactive features in a meaningful way for the static output.
          The HTML output enables interactivity, but no special hover templates, animations,
          or advanced Plotly-specific features are showcased.
  verdict: APPROVED
