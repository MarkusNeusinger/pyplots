review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm implementation with force-directed simulation
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct color families (blue/yellow/green) for each
    main category
  - Proportional sizing correctly represents storage values
  - White circle outlines effectively separate nested circles
  - Realistic file system scenario with sensible folder structure and GB values
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with geom_polygon for custom circle shapes
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (create_circle_points, pack_circles_in_parent) instead of
    flat KISS structure
  - Some child circle labels (especially in smaller circles) could be slightly larger
    for better readability
