review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear parent-child relationships through spatial
    adjacency
  - Smart label hiding for small rectangles prevents text overlap
  - Realistic file system example matches spec applications perfectly
  - Clean color progression by hierarchy level using Python-inspired blue/yellow palette
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics (geom_rect, geom_text, theme_void)
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (calculate_values, compute_icicle_layout) instead of
    inline KISS structure
  - 'Levels 2 and 3 yellow colors (#FFD43B and #FFE873) are too similar to distinguish
    easily'
  - Missing value/size annotations on rectangles would help users understand proportional
    sizing
  - Some leaf nodes (Config, Scripts, Notes) are invisible due to narrow width threshold
