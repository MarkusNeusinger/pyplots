review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style contribution graph aesthetic with appropriate green gradient
    colors
  - Realistic data generation with weekday/weekend patterns and seasonal variation
  - Proper calendar structure with weeks as columns and days as rows
  - Clean title format following the required convention
  - Good use of white borders and rounded corners for visual appeal
  - Comprehensive tooltip implementation with proper pluralization
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom portion of canvas has noticeable empty space; layout could be more balanced
  - Legend title could include a subtitle explaining the scale
  - PNG has slight aspect ratio issue (2661px instead of 2700px)
