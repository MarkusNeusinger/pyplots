review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with server response times across geographic
    regions
  - Clean stacking visualization with good color separation using white edge lines
  - All three distributions have distinct characteristics (different means, scales,
    and sample sizes)
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good use of alpha for slight transparency while maintaining visibility
  weaknesses:
  - No distinctive matplotlib features beyond basic histogram; could use annotations,
    custom spine styling, or statistical overlays
  - Legend visual separation could be enhanced with a border or better background
