review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with the coolwarm color gradient that intuitively maps
    cold months to blue and warm months to red
  - Perfect implementation of the ridgeline pattern using seaborn FacetGrid with appropriate
    overlap (-0.5 hspace)
  - Highly readable with bold, color-matched month labels positioned cleanly to the
    left
  - Data is realistic and demonstrates clear seasonal temperature patterns in a temperate
    climate
  - White outline on ridges enhances visual separation and readability
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a small helper function (label) which slightly deviates from the KISS
    structure preference
  - Could benefit from slightly more variation in distribution spread between months
    to showcase the full capability of ridgeline plots
