review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling through three distinct density clusters with different
    shapes and intensities
  - Smart use of sqrt color transform to reveal low-density structure while preserving
    hotspot visibility
  - Warm magma colormap with clipped begin/end avoids extreme palette edges
  - Informative subtitle explaining the color scaling strategy
  - Clean code structure with descriptive variable names and comments
  - Full use of letsplot tooltip builder API for the HTML export
  weaknesses:
  - Title text slightly cramped against top canvas edge; additional top margin would
    improve breathing room
  - Grid lines could be further reduced or removed for cleaner aesthetics
  - Missing coord_fixed() which would enforce equal aspect ratio for spatial coordinate
    data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning density map titled "hexbin-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "GPS ping density — sqrt-scaled color
    reveals low-density structure." The x-axis is labeled "East–West (km from center)"
    ranging from about -8 to 13, and the y-axis "North–South (km from center)" ranging
    from about -6 to 8. Hexagonal bins are colored using a magma colormap (dark purple
    for low counts through magenta/pink to bright yellow-orange for high counts),
    with thin white borders separating each hexagon. Three distinct density clusters
    are visible: a bright hotspot around (-2, 1) representing a university campus,
    a large moderate-density region around (3–5, 2–4) for a downtown core, and a smaller
    tight bright cluster around (0, -3.5) for a transit hub. Sparse dark hexagons
    populate the periphery representing residential pings. A legend on the right labeled
    "Ping Count" shows sqrt-scaled values (4, 16, 36, 64, 100, 144). The panel background
    is a warm off-white (#F5F5F0) with dashed light gray grid lines.'
