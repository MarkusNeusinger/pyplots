review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with clear comments explaining the explosion technique
  - Good colorblind-safe palette starting with Python brand colors
  - Realistic market share scenario with meaningful category emphasis
  - Large, readable percentage labels on each slice
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output despite being configured in code
    (may be cropped or off-canvas)
  - Explosion effect renders as an outer ring/halo rather than traditional separation
    where slices are pulled away from the center
  - Pie chart appears off-center due to the missing/cropped legend space
