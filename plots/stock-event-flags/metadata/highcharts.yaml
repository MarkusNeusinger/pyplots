review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highstock library features for stock charts with flags
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette distinguishing event types
  - Realistic financial data scenario with appropriate corporate events
  - Multiple flag shapes and colors for different event types (earnings, dividends,
    splits, news)
  - Clean code structure with proper data generation
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels are not visible in the rendered output
  - Legend is defined but not appearing in the bottom of the chart
  - Flag markers are relatively small compared to the chart canvas size - increase
    flag width/height for better visibility
  - The vertical connector lines from flags to price levels are not visible
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock candlestick chart with 120 trading
    days of price data, showing OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) candles. Blue candles represent
    bullish (up) days while red candles represent bearish (down) days. The price ranges
    from approximately $144 to $200, starting high and trending downward through mid-chart
    before partially recovering. Event flags are displayed on the chart at various
    positions: small blue square pins (earnings events with "Q4" and "Q1" labels),
    green flags (dividend events with "D" labels), a purple circle pin (stock split
    with "S" label), and yellow flags (news events with "N" labels). The title reads
    "stock-event-flags · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Stock Price with
    Earnings, Dividends, Splits, and News Events". A horizontal dashed line at $180
    marks the starting price. The y-axis shows "Price (USD)" with dollar values. However,
    the x-axis date labels are not visible, the legend at the bottom is not visible,
    and the flag labels are very small and difficult to read.'
