review:
  strengths:
  - Impressive creative solution implementing 3D surface in a 2D library using manual
    projection and painter algorithm
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for both aesthetics and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean, well-commented code explaining the projection mathematics
  - Added pan/zoom interactivity via selection_interval - appropriate for exploring
    a projected 2D view
  - Proper depth sorting ensures correct rendering order of surface facets
  - Good canvas utilization and balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - Rectangle-based approximation creates minor visual artifacts at facet edges (inherent
    limitation)
  - Axis labeling could be clearer - X (projected) and Z (height) may confuse users
    unfamiliar with 3D projection
