review:
  strengths:
  - Bimodal Engineering distribution brilliantly showcases violin plots advantage
    over box plots
  - Realistic relatable salary-by-department context with appropriate scales
  - All font sizes explicitly set to correct values for 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features present
  - Clean well-structured code with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two similar blue shades (#306998 and #4B8BBE) for Engineering and Sales reduce
    palette distinctiveness'
  - No visual emphasis highlighting the interesting bimodal Engineering distribution
    or wide Sales spread
  - Box plots inside violins are small and hard to read in detail
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 violin plots for departments: Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, and Support, showing annual salary distributions. Colors are
    muted blue (#306998) for Engineering, orange (#E8873D) for Marketing, light blue
    (#4B8BBE) for Sales, and green (#6AAB73) for Support. Each violin is semi-transparent
    (opacity 0.7) with a white box plot embedded inside showing quartiles and a dashed
    mean line. The background uses plotly_white template with subtle horizontal gridlines
    at rgba(0,0,0,0.1). Title "violin-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    top in ~28pt font. Y-axis reads "Annual Salary ($)" with comma-formatted tick
    values from ~20,000 to ~145,000. X-axis reads "Department" with 4 category labels.
    Engineering shows a clear bimodal distribution (two humps around 75k and 92k),
    Marketing is a symmetric bell curve centered ~72k, Sales has the widest spread
    centered ~78k, and Support is the narrowest and lowest centered ~55k. The plot
    fills the canvas well with balanced margins.'
