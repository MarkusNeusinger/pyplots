review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of drawdown concept with clear filled area representation
  - 'All spec requirements implemented: zero baseline, max drawdown marker, recovery
    points, key statistics in caption'
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good data generation that creates realistic drawdown patterns with multiple recovery
    cycles
  - Appropriate color scheme with red fill and distinct markers for max drawdown and
    recovery points
  weaknesses:
  - Tooltips are explicitly disabled (tooltips="none") which removes lets-plot interactive
    advantage
  - Grid lines are barely visible even with explicit styling; could use slightly higher
    alpha or different color
  - Does not leverage lets-plot specific features like interactive hover tooltips
    or other interactive elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart showing percentage decline
    from peak value over approximately 500 trading days. The chart uses a semi-transparent
    red (#DC2626) filled area below the zero baseline to visualize drawdown depth.
    A dashed dark gray zero line provides the reference baseline. Multiple drawdown
    periods are clearly visible: a significant drawdown around day 50-100 reaching
    approximately -40%, followed by recoveries and subsequent drawdowns around days
    150-300 (ranging from -8% to -15%), and the maximum drawdown around day 350-420
    reaching approximately -43%. Green circled markers at the zero line indicate recovery
    points where the price returned to previous highs. A brown circled marker identifies
    the maximum drawdown point at approximately -42.9% on day 402. The caption in
    the bottom-right displays "Max Drawdown: -42.9% on Day 402". The title correctly
    follows the format "drawdown-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai". A legend at the top
    shows "Markers" with Max Drawdown (brown circle) and Recovery Point (green circle)
    indicators.'

        comment: The implementation uses basic ggplot grammar which is shared with
          plotnine; does not leverage lets-plot specific features like interactive
          tooltips (which were disabled with tooltips=none), hover interactions, or
          the library's unique layering capabilities
