review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data representation with clear parent-child relationships
  - Consistent color families (same hue, varying lightness) as specified
  - Gap between inner and outer rings provides good visual separation
  - Smart labeling strategy - only labels segments >= 80K threshold
  - White bold text on inner ring provides excellent contrast
  - Clean theme with all axis elements properly hidden
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario matches spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function slightly deviates from KISS principle but is necessary for the
    polygon-based approach
  - Outer ring labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
