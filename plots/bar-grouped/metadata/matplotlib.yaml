review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly spaced bars
  - Colorblind-safe color palette using Python brand colors plus complementary green
  - Value labels on bars enhance precise comparisons as suggested in spec notes
  - Data tells a realistic story with different growth patterns per product line
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in upper left may conflict with data if values were higher in
    Q1 (upper right or outside plot would be safer)
