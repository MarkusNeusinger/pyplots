review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly hovertemplate with customdata for rich, formatted tooltips
    showing revenue, market share, units sold, and YoY growth
  - Clean visual design with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good annotation guiding users to hover for details
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static preview and full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Grid present but no legend (minor - single series does not require legend)
  - The annotation positioning could be improved - slightly low on the canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 8 product categories
    on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Food,
    Health) and Revenue ($K) on the y-axis ranging from 0 to approximately 4250. Bars
    are rendered in a consistent blue color (#306998) with darker blue edge outlines
    (#1f4d6b). The bars are arranged in descending order by revenue, with Electronics
    having the highest bar (~4250) and Health the lowest (~1290). The title "bar-interactive
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray text (size 32). Axis
    labels are clearly readable with "Product Category" on the x-axis and "Revenue
    ($K)" on the y-axis, both with appropriate font sizes (24pt for labels, 18pt for
    ticks). A subtle gray annotation at the bottom reads "Hover over bars for detailed
    breakdown" to guide user interaction. The background is white with light gray
    horizontal gridlines (alpha 0.1). The layout is well-balanced with appropriate
    margins (l=100, r=60, t=120, b=100) and good bar spacing (bargap=0.3).
