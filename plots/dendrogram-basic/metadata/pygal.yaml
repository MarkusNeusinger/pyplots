review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using pygal XY chart to manually draw dendrogram segments
    since pygal has no native dendrogram support
  - Excellent use of scipy linkage for proper hierarchical clustering computation
  - Good color choice (Python Blue) with clean white background
  - Proper handling of leaf ordering from linkage matrix using iterative approach
  - Realistic iris flower dataset with three distinct species showing clear clustering
    patterns
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels (sample names) do not align with the actual leaf positions in the
    dendrogram - labels are evenly spaced but dendrogram x-coordinates are based on
    leaf order indices
  - Grid lines are too prominent and dense, making the plot feel cluttered
  - Font sizes for x-axis tick labels could be larger for better readability at 4800x2700
    resolution
