review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of filled contours with custom colorscale transitioning from transparent
    white to yellow to blue
  - Smart combination of density contours with scatter point overlay provides context
    as recommended in spec
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate the plot purpose of finding density
    patterns
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output (scale=3)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Variable, Y Variable) rather than tied to a realistic
    context
  - Grid lines are too subtle (alpha 0.1) - consider alpha 0.2-0.3 for better visibility
