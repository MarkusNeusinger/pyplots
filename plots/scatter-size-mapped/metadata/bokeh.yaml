review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data context using realistic country economic indicators with plausible
    regional characteristics
  - Proper log-scaling of population for bubble sizes ensures visibility across orders
    of magnitude
  - Good use of semi-transparency (alpha 0.6) to reveal overlapping bubbles
  - Clean color palette (Category10) with good accessibility
  - Proper axis labels with units
  - Well-styled legend with appropriate font sizes and background
  weaknesses:
  - Missing interactive hover tooltips showing country details (population, exact
    values) - a key Bokeh strength
  - Legend shows fixed-size glyphs rather than indicating what bubble sizes represent
    (no size legend)
  - Some smaller bubbles (especially Oceania) are at the edge of visibility
