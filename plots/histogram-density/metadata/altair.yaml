review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal distribution demonstrates density histogram features very effectively
  - Clean visual design with proper color contrast between histogram bars and KDE
    overlay
  - Proper density normalization with clear axis labeling including units
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional value for exploration
  - Realistic cognitive psychology scenario with plausible reaction time values
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the KDE line (yellow line has no label)
  - Could use Altair's built-in transform_density() instead of scipy for more idiomatic
    implementation
  image_description: The plot displays a density histogram with blue rectangular bars
    (#306998 color with darker blue stroke) showing the distribution of reaction times
    in milliseconds. The x-axis is labeled "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from approximately
    100 to 540, and the y-axis shows "Density (probability per ms)" ranging from 0
    to 0.0120. A yellow KDE (kernel density estimate) line (#FFD43B) smoothly overlays
    the histogram bars, clearly showing a bimodal distribution with a primary peak
    around 250ms and a secondary smaller peak around 380ms. The title "histogram-density
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The plot has a clean white background
    with subtle gray gridlines.
