review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lower-triangle format to reduce redundancy as suggested in spec
  - Colorblind-safe blue-orange diverging palette centered at zero
  - Clear cell annotations with 2 decimal places and good text outline for readability
  - Realistic financial metrics data with meaningful correlation patterns
  - Proper use of Highcharts-specific features (colorAxis stops, JavaScript formatters,
    HeatmapSeries)
  - Square aspect ratio (3600x3600) is appropriate for symmetric matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Color bar could benefit from a title label (e.g., Correlation)
  - Variable names on axes lack context (could optionally include units or fuller
    descriptions)
  image_description: The plot displays a correlation matrix heatmap for 7 financial
    metrics (Revenue, Profit, Expenses, Growth, ROI, Debt, Assets). It uses a lower-triangle
    format showing only the unique correlations plus diagonal. The color scheme is
    a diverging blue-white-orange palette, where blue represents negative correlations,
    white represents zero, and orange represents positive correlations. Each cell
    is annotated with the correlation coefficient to 2 decimal places. The title follows
    the required format "heatmap-correlation · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle
    "Financial Metrics Correlation Matrix". Y-axis labels are horizontal and readable,
    while X-axis labels are rotated at approximately 315 degrees. A vertical color
    bar on the right shows the scale from -1 to 1 with tick marks at 0.5 intervals.
