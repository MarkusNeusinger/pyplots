review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh native step() glyph with after mode for proper step visualization
  - Well-chosen color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) markers
    providing clear visual contrast
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for 4800x2700 canvas (48pt title, 36pt labels, 28pt
    ticks)
  - Clean realistic data scenario (monthly cumulative sales) that perfectly demonstrates
    step plot utility
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for Bokeh best practices
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (dashed lines are slightly prominent)
