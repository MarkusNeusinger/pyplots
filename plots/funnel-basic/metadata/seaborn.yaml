review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with well-proportioned trapezoidal segments
  - Clear blue-to-gold color progression that aids visual hierarchy
  - 'Perfect text contrast: white text on blue, dark text on gold backgrounds'
  - Uses exact data from specification (sales funnel example)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Conversion rate annotations (coded in lines 88-99) are not visible in the rendered
    output - may be positioned outside canvas bounds
  - Could use seaborn color palette more distinctively (e.g., using a named sequential
    palette)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a funnel chart for a sales pipeline with 5
    stages arranged vertically from top to bottom: Awareness (1,000 / 100%), Interest
    (600 / 60%), Consideration (400 / 40%), Intent (200 / 20%), and Purchase (100
    / 10%). Each stage is rendered as a trapezoidal segment with widths proportional
    to their values. The color palette transitions from deep blue (#306998) at the
    top through lighter blues to gold/yellow (#FFD43B, #E8C547) at the bottom. Stage
    names appear on the left side in bold dark gray text, while values with percentages
    are centered within each segment in white (for blue segments) or dark text (for
    gold segments). The title "funnel-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The layout is clean with a white background and good spacing between segments.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme() and sns.color_palette(), but core drawing uses
          matplotlib Polygon; this is acceptable since seaborn doesn't have a native
          funnel chart
  verdict: APPROVED
