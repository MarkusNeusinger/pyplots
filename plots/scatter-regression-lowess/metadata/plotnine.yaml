review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of agricultural context (temperature vs crop yield) that naturally
    demonstrates non-linear LOWESS behavior
  - Perfect color contrast between blue scatter points and yellow LOWESS curve
  - Clean, minimal theme with appropriate text sizing for 4800×2700 resolution
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Title format exactly matches specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - The LOWESS curve extends slightly below y=0 at the left edge, which is visually
    awkward for a yield that should be positive
  - The span parameter in geom_smooth may not be correctly controlling the LOWESS
    bandwidth
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 150 data points in a soft
    blue color (#306998) with 0.6 alpha transparency. A prominent yellow/gold (#FFD43B)
    LOWESS regression curve smoothly fits through the data, showing a clear non-linear
    relationship between Temperature (°C) on the x-axis (ranging from ~5 to 35) and
    Crop Yield (tons/hectare) on the y-axis (ranging from ~0 to ~90). The curve demonstrates
    a classic optimal temperature response - yields are low at cold temperatures (~5°C),
    rise through the middle range, peak around 20-22°C at ~78 tons/hectare, then decline
    at higher temperatures. The title "scatter-regression-lowess · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with a clean white background
    and subtle grid lines. Axis labels include units (°C, tons/hectare). The 16:9
    landscape layout is well-proportioned.

        comment: Uses `geom_smooth(method="lowess")` which is a nice plotnine/ggplot2
          feature, but `span` parameter may not be the correct parameter name (it
          should be `frac` for LOWESS in statsmodels). However, the curve appears
          to work.
  verdict: APPROVED
