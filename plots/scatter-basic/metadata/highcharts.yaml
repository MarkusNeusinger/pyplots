review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with outlier detection, trend line + R-squared annotation,
    and quartile plot bands
  - Strong Highcharts-idiomatic code using typed API (ScatterSeries, SplineSeries,
    Annotation.from_dict)
  - Rich tooltip formatting with HTML pointFormat is a distinctive Highcharts feature
  - Clean, well-structured code with no unnecessary complexity
  - Realistic height vs weight scenario with appropriate data generation
  - 'Professional visual polish: custom typography, marker hover states, subtle grid
    styling'
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title Height (cm) is partially clipped at the bottom of the canvas — increase
    marginBottom or spacingBottom
  - The 190 X-axis tick label is slightly cut off at the right edge — increase marginRight
  - Quartile plot band labels (Lower quartile, Upper quartile) are too faint at rgba
    alpha 0.3 and 26px font size — increase opacity to at least 0.5 and font size
    to 30px+
  - Blue vs red color scheme for subjects/outliers relies partly on hue distinction
    — consider using orange or a more colorblind-distinguishable color for outliers
    while keeping diamond shape
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart on a light gray (#fafbfc) background
    titled "scatter-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Height vs Weight
    — positive correlation across 100 subjects." The X-axis shows "Height (cm)" ranging
    from approximately 142 to 190, and the Y-axis shows "Weight (kg)" ranging from
    approximately 50 to 96. The main data points are semi-transparent blue circles
    with white edge outlines (labeled "Subjects" in the legend). Approximately 6-7
    outlier points are shown as dark red/crimson diamond markers (labeled "Outliers").
    An orange long-dashed trend line runs from lower-left to upper-right showing the
    positive correlation. An annotation box near the lower-left displays "y = 0.54x
    -20.5 | R² = 0.29" with an orange border. The legend is positioned in the upper-right
    corner with a white semi-transparent background and rounded corners. Very faint
    "Lower quartile" and "Upper quartile" plot band labels appear on the left edge
    with subtle blue-tinted background bands. Dotted grid lines provide reference
    throughout. The X-axis title "Height (cm)" appears slightly clipped at the bottom
    edge of the canvas.

        comment: Marker radius 14 with alpha 0.65 for 100 points is appropriate, though
          slightly large causing some visual crowding.

        comment: Blue vs red with different shapes (circle vs diamond) helps colorblind
          users, but blue-red hue distinction alone is not ideal.
