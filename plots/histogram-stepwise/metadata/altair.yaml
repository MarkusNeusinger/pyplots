review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram concept using manual bin calculation
    and mark_line with step-after interpolation
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean bimodal data distribution clearly demonstrates the step histogram visualization
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types
  - Saves both PNG and HTML outputs as expected for Altair
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could specify what is being measured)
  - Single distribution only - spec mentions overlaying multiple distributions as
    an application
  - Could leverage Altair interactive features like tooltips for the HTML output
