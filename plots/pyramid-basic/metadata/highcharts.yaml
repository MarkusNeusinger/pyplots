review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of pyramid chart using Highcharts bar chart with negative
    values for left side
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette using Python official colors
  - Proper symmetric axis scaling with calculated max value
  - Good use of custom JavaScript formatters for tooltips and data labels showing
    absolute values
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Realistic demographic data context
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend appears to be positioned outside the visible screenshot area (y: -50 may
    push it off-screen)'
  - The mirrored Y-axis on the right side is redundant and adds visual clutter
  - Could use Highcharts-specific annotations or interactive features more extensively
