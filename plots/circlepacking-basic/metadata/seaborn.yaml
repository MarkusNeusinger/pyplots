review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS structure without helper functions (fixed from previous attempt)
  - Now uses sns.scatterplot for actual plotting instead of just styling (improvement
    from attempt 1)
  - Excellent color scheme with colorblind-safe blue/yellow/teal palette
  - Clear hierarchy representation with three distinct depth levels
  - Realistic business context with product category sales data
  - Well-designed legend explaining hierarchy levels
  weaknesses:
  - Subcategory circles (particularly Pants, Shirts in Clothing) still extend slightly
    beyond parent category circle boundaries
  - Circle packing is not a native seaborn plot type - implementation relies on scatter
    markers sized to appear as circles
  - Legend entry 'Root (All Products)' doesn't match what's visible in the plot since
    root has no label
  - Some padding and containment math could be tighter to ensure strict nesting
