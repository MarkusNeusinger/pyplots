review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent parallel categories visualization with clear flow ribbons showing customer
    journey paths across four dimensions
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good distinction between product categories (blue,
    yellow, teal, coral)
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic e-commerce scenario with meaningful data showing different purchase
    patterns
  - Width-proportional ribbons correctly represent observation counts as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Middle dimension labels (Channel, Payment) are missing - only first and last dimensions
    show category labels
  - The 'Cancelled' label on the rightmost axis is very small and barely readable
    compared to other labels
  - Code uses helper function xml_escape() which violates KISS principle (no functions/classes
    rule)
  - Gray bars for middle dimensions reduce visual clarity - consider using color coding
    throughout
