review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with good CPU monitoring scenario and realistic data patterns
  - Effective use of pygal fill area and warning threshold line
  - Title follows the required format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  - Live indicator with current value prominently displayed in legend
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows truncated text (Warning Thresh... instead of full label)
  - Fade effect for older data mentioned in code but not clearly visible in output
    - the trailing edge visual indication could be more prominent
  - X-axis time labels could be slightly larger for better legibility at this canvas
    size
