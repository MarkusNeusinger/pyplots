review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-differentiated colored cells and prominent
    seed point markers
  - Proper implementation of Voronoi clipping using mirrored points technique
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, figure configuration, export_png)
  - Clean color palette with 20 distinct colors for all cells
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a function definition (clip_polygon_to_box) which violates the KISS
    structure requirement (no functions/classes)
  - Grid and Legend criterion partially missed (no legend, though arguably not needed
    for this plot type)
  image_description: The plot displays a Voronoi diagram with 20 seed points distributed
    across a 10x10 coordinate space. Each Voronoi cell is filled with a distinct pastel
    color (including shades of blue, purple, pink, salmon, teal, mint green, yellow,
    and light blue) at approximately 50% opacity. The cells are outlined with dark
    gray/charcoal borders. Each seed point is marked with a solid blue circular marker
    with a white edge, making them clearly visible within their respective cells.
    The title "voronoi-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. X-axis
    is labeled "X Coordinate" (0-10) and Y-axis is labeled "Y Coordinate" (0-10).
    A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background. The plot fills the entire canvas
    well with balanced proportions.
