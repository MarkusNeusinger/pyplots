review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all Bland-Altman components (bias line, limits of
    agreement, annotations)
  - Realistic blood pressure comparison scenario with appropriate data generation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, Span, Label)
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  - Well-sized text elements appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left could be moved to avoid proximity to data points
    (consider top-right or outside plot)
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance interactivity and is a key Bokeh strength
  - Grid styling is good but legend could have cleaner integration
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement plot with 80 blue
    scatter points showing paired blood pressure measurements. Three horizontal reference
    lines are present: a solid blue line at the mean bias (-2.82 mmHg), and two dashed
    yellow lines at the upper (+13.34 mmHg) and lower (-18.99 mmHg) limits of agreement
    (±1.96 SD). Each reference line has an annotation on the left side showing its
    value. The title "bland-altman-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    The x-axis is labeled "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" and the y-axis "Difference
    (Method 1 - Method 2) (mmHg)". A legend labeled "Observations" is in the top left.
    The background is white with subtle dashed grid lines.'

        comment: Blood pressure values (100-160 mmHg systolic range) are realistic;
          difference values are plausible but the bias and SD seem slightly high for
          typical device comparisons

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, Span for reference lines, and Label for annotations;
          also outputs HTML for interactivity. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific
          features like HoverTool for data inspection.
  verdict: APPROVED
