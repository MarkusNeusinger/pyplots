review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for accessibility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good interactive features with zoom/pan and tooltips
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal patterns
  - Proper cell separation with white stroke borders
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit reset view functionality (double-click or button) mentioned in
    spec
  - Could add crosshair/highlight effect on hover for better cell identification in
    large matrices
  - Legend could include units in title (e.g., Performance Score (%))
  image_description: The plot displays a heatmap with 15 products (Product A through
    Product O) on the Y-axis and 12 months (Jan through Dec) on the X-axis. The cells
    are colored using the viridis colormap, ranging from dark purple (low values ~0)
    through teal/green to yellow (high values ~100). A vertical colorbar on the right
    shows "Performance Score" ranging from 0 to 100. The title "heatmap-interactive
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. White borders separate each cell.
    The data shows a clear seasonal pattern with higher values (yellow-green) in spring
    months (Mar-May) and lower values (teal-blue) in late summer/fall months (Aug-Oct).
    Products I through O (bottom half) generally show higher performance than Products
    A through H (top half).
