review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Smart adaptive text colors (white on dark, black on light cells) for optimal readability
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and all spec requirements met
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output leveraging Bokeh interactivity capability
  - Well-sized text elements for 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include more context (e.g., Month 2024 or Product Category)
  - Could add HoverTool for enhanced interactivity in HTML version
  - Random data does not show clear patterns/clusters typical in real sales data
  image_description: The plot displays a 6x8 heatmap showing "Monthly Sales Performance
    by Product Category." The y-axis shows Product A through Product F, and the x-axis
    shows months Jan through Aug. Each cell contains a numeric value (0-100) representing
    sales scores. The Viridis colormap is used (purple for low values ~0, teal/green
    for mid values ~50, yellow for high values ~100). Cell annotations use adaptive
    text colors - white text on dark purple cells, black text on light yellow/green
    cells. A vertical colorbar on the right is labeled "Sales Score" with tick marks
    from 0 to 100. The title "heatmap-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left.
    Axis labels show "Month" and "Product". Background is light gray (#f8f8f8).

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, LinearColorMapper, ColorBar, LabelSet correctly.
          Good use of Bokeh's rect glyph for heatmap. Also generates HTML for interactivity.
          Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool.
  verdict: APPROVED
