review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot for continuous density visualization
  - Good data generation with realistic clustered geographic patterns (multiple hotspots)
  - Proper coordinate system with degree formatting
  - Clean colorbar with density label
  - Appropriate transparency on scatter overlay to show data points without obscuring
    KDE
  weaknesses:
  - Missing true geographic basemap context (spec mentions coastlines/boundaries)
  - Colorbar label says Density generically but could be more descriptive
  image_description: The plot displays a geographic heatmap of the San Francisco Bay
    Area using kernel density estimation. The visualization shows a smooth density
    gradient from pale yellow (low density ~2.5) to dark red (high density ~412.6)
    using the YlOrRd colormap. There is a clear high-density hotspot centered around
    coordinates (37.80°N, 122.40°W) shown in deep red/orange. The density decreases
    concentrically outward to yellow and pale yellow at the edges. Blue-gray semi-transparent
    scatter points overlay the heatmap showing individual data locations. The title
    "heatmap-geographic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at the top. Axis
    labels show "Longitude (°W)" and "Latitude (°N)" with degree symbols. A colorbar
    on the right displays the density scale labeled "Density". The plot uses a white
    background with subtle gray dashed gridlines.
