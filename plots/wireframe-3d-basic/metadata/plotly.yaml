review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wireframe using Scatter3d traces for both x and y
    grid lines
  - Clean, elegant visual design with consistent Python Blue color scheme
  - Perfect title format and professional axis labeling with mathematical notation
    for Z axis
  - Appropriate viewing angle that showcases the 3D structure effectively
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Code follows KISS principle with clear structure
  weaknesses:
  - X and Y axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis) rather than descriptive with
    units
  - Could utilize Plotly hover capabilities to show (x, y, z) coordinates on wireframe
    lines
  - Single uniform color misses opportunity for height-based coloring mentioned as
    optional in spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a beautiful 3D wireframe visualization of
    the mathematical ripple function z = sin(√(x² + y²)). The wireframe uses a consistent
    Python Blue (#306998) color for all lines, creating an elegant mesh structure
    with lines running in both x and y directions. The surface shows the characteristic
    concentric wave pattern radiating from the center, with a peak at z=1 in the middle
    and oscillating values outward. The title "wireframe-3d-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. All three axes are clearly labeled: "X Axis" and "Y Axis"
    for the horizontal planes, and "Z = sin(√(x² + y²))" for the vertical axis with
    proper mathematical notation. The viewing angle (~30° elevation, ~45° azimuth)
    provides excellent visibility of the 3D structure. The light gray background planes
    with subtle gridlines provide good spatial reference without distraction.'
