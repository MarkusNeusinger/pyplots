review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title formatting following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Professional colorblind-safe palette (Python Blue, Yellow, Purple)
  - 'Good use of Highcharts features: data labels, styled legend with border/shadow,
    dashed grid lines'
  - Appropriate 4800x2700 sizing with properly scaled font sizes
  - Clean code structure following the library-specific export pattern with inline
    JS
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful data context
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis has too many tick intervals (every $10K from 0 to $420K creates 43 tick
    marks), making the grid overly dense
  - All three product lines show uniform upward trends - data could demonstrate more
    varied patterns (e.g., one declining, seasonal variations)
