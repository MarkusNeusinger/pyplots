review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of rose chart using Bokeh wedge glyph with correct angle
    calculations
  - Clean seasonal pattern visualization with meaningful color coding (blue for wet
    months, yellow for dry)
  - Well-proportioned layout with chart filling canvas appropriately
  - Subtle gridlines (dashed, alpha 0.3) aid value estimation without visual clutter
  - Proper start position at top (12 o clock) as recommended in spec for time data
  weaknesses:
  - Scale labels show percentages rather than actual rainfall values in mm which would
    be more informative
  - Month label for Dec appears slightly inside the wedge rather than outside like
    other labels
