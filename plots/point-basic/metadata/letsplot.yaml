review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_pointrange for clean point-and-interval visualization
  - Proper horizontal orientation with coord_flip for readable category labels
  - Reference line at zero helps interpretation of effect sizes
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with varying confidence interval widths
  weaknesses:
  - All effect sizes are positive; including at least one negative or zero-crossing
    effect would better demonstrate the plot utility
  - Does not include error bar caps at endpoints (spec suggests caps)
