review:
  strengths:
  - Clean MACD calculation using pandas EWM for exponential moving averages
  - Good color scheme with green/red histogram and blue/orange lines
  - Proper use of pygal secondary series feature for overlaying lines on bars
  - Zero reference line implemented with dashed stroke style
  - Date formatting shows every 15th date to prevent crowding
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram should be rendered as discrete bars rather than filled areas (spec explicitly
    states Display histogram as bars)
  - The MACD and Signal lines appear to have fill enabled rather than being clean
    stroke-only lines
  - Legend labels could better describe the series
  image_description: 'The plot displays a MACD technical indicator chart on a white
    background at 4800×2700 resolution. The title "indicator-macd · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center in large font. The chart shows five data series over
    approximately 100 trading days (Feb 20 - May 20): a blue MACD line labeled "MACD
    (12,26)", an orange Signal line labeled "Signal (9)", green filled areas for positive
    histogram values labeled "Histogram (+)", red filled areas for negative histogram
    values labeled "Histogram (-)", and a black dashed zero reference line labeled
    "Zero". The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart with all five series
    clearly labeled. The X-axis shows dates with labels every ~15 days rotated at
    45 degrees for readability (Feb 20, Mar 01, Mar 11, Mar 21, Mar 31, Apr 10, Apr
    20, Apr 30, May 10, May 20), and the Y-axis displays MACD values ranging from
    approximately -3.5 to +1.5. The histogram shows clear transitions between positive
    (green) and negative (red) regions, indicating momentum shifts. The MACD and signal
    line crossovers are visible, providing trading signal context.'
