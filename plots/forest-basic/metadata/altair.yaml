review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and markers
  - Diamond shape for pooled estimate is distinctive and correctly implemented
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition with 7 layers cleanly combined
  - Weight-proportional marker sizing implemented correctly
  - Appropriate color scheme with blue/yellow contrast
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Helpful tooltips for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The Favors Treatment and Favors Control annotations appear slightly cut off at
    the edges
  - All studies show negative effects favoring treatment - having at least one study
    crossing the null line would better demonstrate forest plot interpretation
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like selection for highlighting
