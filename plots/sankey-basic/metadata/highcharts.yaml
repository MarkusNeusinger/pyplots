review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Realistic energy flow data with appropriate TWh units in subtitle and tooltip
  - Multi-level flow visualization (sources → intermediate → end uses) demonstrates
    Sankey capabilities well
  - Node colors are distinct and colorblind-safe
  - Link opacity (0.5) helps with crossing flow visibility as spec recommends
  weaknesses:
  - All flow links use the same light blue color instead of inheriting from source
    node colors, making it harder to trace flows from specific sources
  - No np.random.seed(42) statement present (though data is hardcoded and deterministic)
  - Flow coloring could leverage Highcharts colorByPoint or inherit source colors
    for better traceability
