review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-calibrated font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Correct use of pygal.XY with stroke=False for scatter plot behavior
  - Proper implementation of transparency (opacity=0.7) as specified
  - Excellent code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct title format matching the specification
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (generic X Value, Y Value)
  - Dot size could be slightly larger for better visibility at 100 data points
  - Data is generic random correlation rather than a realistic scenario
