review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic context with coastline, ocean fill, and state borders
  - Well-labeled contour lines with appropriate intervals (250m for filled, 500m for
    lines)
  - Proper use of terrain colormap appropriate for elevation data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good use of matplotlib Polygon patch for ocean rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Contour line width (1.2) could be slightly heavier (2.0) for better visibility
    at high resolution
  - Grid alpha (0.4) could be reduced to 0.3 for less visual competition with contour
    lines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a contour map of elevation data overlaid on
    a geographic basemap representing the Western United States (roughly latitude
    32°N-49°N, longitude 125°W-105°W). The visualization uses the "terrain" colormap,
    transitioning from blue (low elevations ~0-500m) through green and yellow (500-2000m)
    to brown and gray/white (high elevations ~2500-4000m+). The Pacific Ocean is rendered
    as a light blue polygon on the western edge, with a bold black coastline separating
    land from sea. Dashed gray lines represent state borders (Oregon-California, Oregon-Washington,
    Nevada-California, and Idaho). Contour lines are drawn in dark gray with labels
    showing elevation values in meters (e.g., "500 m", "1000 m", "1500 m", etc.).
    Two distinct mountain ranges are visible: the Sierra Nevada/Cascades on the western
    edge near the coast, and the Rocky Mountains on the eastern edge. A vertical colorbar
    on the right shows the elevation scale from 0 to ~4000m. The title follows the
    correct format, axes are labeled with degree notation (°W, °N), and a subtle dashed
    grid is present.'
