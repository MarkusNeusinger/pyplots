review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of overlay barmode for true overlapping histograms with proper transparency
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow) with good contrast
  - Realistic height data scenario that clearly demonstrates distribution overlap
  - Proper font sizing scaled for 4800x2700 output
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML export (leveraging plotly strengths)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - None significant - implementation is publication quality
  image_description: 'The plot displays two overlapping histograms comparing height
    distributions between Male (steel blue, #306998) and Female (gold/yellow, #FFD43B)
    groups. The title "histogram-overlapping · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top in large font. The x-axis shows "Height (cm)" ranging from ~145 to ~195
    cm, and the y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to 40. Both histograms use 50% opacity
    with overlay mode, revealing the intersection region around 160-175 cm where distributions
    overlap. A legend with semi-transparent background is positioned in the top-right
    corner. The grid is subtle with light gray lines on a white background.'
