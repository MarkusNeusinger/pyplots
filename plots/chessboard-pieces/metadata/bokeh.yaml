review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, Label, rect glyphs)
  - Clean visualization with good color scheme matching lichess.org style
  - Interactive features (pan, zoom, reset) properly configured
  - Both PNG and HTML export for maximum utility
  - Proper chess board orientation with h1 as light square
  - Well-chosen example position (Scholar's Mate is educational and famous)
  weaknesses:
  - The x_range/y_range (-0.8, 7.5) creates slightly asymmetric margins around the
    board
  image_description: The plot displays a chess board showing the Scholar's Mate position
    (a famous quick checkmate). The board has alternating light cream (#F0D9B5) and
    dark brown (#B58863) squares following chess conventions. White pieces are rendered
    with white/outlined Unicode symbols, while black pieces use dark/filled symbols.
    The board shows the classic position with the white queen on f7 delivering checkmate
    to the black king on e8. File labels (a-h) appear in blue (#306998) below the
    board, and rank labels (1-8) are positioned on the left side. The title "Scholar's
    Mate · chessboard-pieces · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in blue.
    The board has a blue border and uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio (3600x3600 pixels).
    All pieces are clearly visible and centered within their squares. The Bokeh toolbar
    is visible on the right side for pan/zoom interactions.
