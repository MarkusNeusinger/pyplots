review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent raincloud layout with cloud on right, boxplot in center, rain on left
    - follows the visual metaphor correctly
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B is clearly visible in the density cloud, demonstrating
    the advantage of raincloud plots
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple, cyan)
  - Proper box plot statistics with quartiles, median, and whiskers
  - Good jitter on individual points prevents excessive overlap
  - Realistic experimental data context with appropriate reaction time values
  - All text legible at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Legend for Individual Points shows a single blue/cyan color but actual points
    vary by category color - this is misleading
  - Code uses raw JavaScript string construction instead of the highcharts_core Python
    library as recommended in library guidelines
  - Legend shows all items generically rather than broken down by category, which
    could be more informative
