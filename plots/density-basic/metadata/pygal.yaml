review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE using manual Gaussian kernel computation with
    Scott's rule for bandwidth
  - Includes optional rug plot showing individual observations as specified
  - Clean, professional appearance with proper filled density curve
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good data scenario (test scores) that demonstrates left-skewed distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks are quite small and could be more visible (rug_height is only 2% of
    max density)
  - Font sizes in custom_style are scaled up but could benefit from fine-tuning for
    optimal readability
  - Manual KDE computation works but does not leverage any pygal-specific statistical
    features
