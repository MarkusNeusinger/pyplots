review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the skew-T transform with proper 45-degree isotherms
  - Clean separation of temperature and dewpoint profiles with appropriate styling
  - Proper logarithmic/inverted pressure axis matching meteorological convention
  - Good use of seaborn theming (whitegrid, talk context) and despine function
  - All major reference lines present (isotherms, dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing
    ratio)
  - Professional label annotations for reference line types
  weaknesses:
  - Reference lines could have a dedicated legend entry for better interpretation
  - Minor reliance on matplotlib for the specialized atmospheric reference lines rather
    than seaborn-specific visualization methods
  image_description: The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with a light
    gray (#fafafa) background. The pressure axis (y-axis) is logarithmic and inverted,
    ranging from 1000 hPa at the bottom to 100 hPa at the top, with labeled tick marks
    at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, and 100 hPa. The temperature
    axis (x-axis) spans from -50°C to 50°C. The temperature profile is shown as a
    solid red line with circular markers, while the dewpoint profile is displayed
    as a dashed blue line with square markers. Both lines decrease with altitude,
    with dewpoint consistently lower than temperature. Gray diagonal isotherms at
    45° skew angle cross the plot. Brown diagonal lines represent dry adiabats, green
    dashed lines show moist adiabats, and blue dotted lines indicate mixing ratio
    lines. Reference labels for "Dry Adiabats", "Moist Adiabats", and "Mixing Ratio"
    appear at the top, with "Isotherms" labeled on the right side. The title uses
    the correct format with middle dots. A legend in the upper right distinguishes
    Temperature and Dewpoint profiles.
