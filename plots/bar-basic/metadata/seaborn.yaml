  strengths:
  - Strong data storytelling with two meaningful annotations (top/bottom performers)
    and arrow callouts that guide the viewer
  - Thoughtful three-tier color hierarchy (dark Python Blue, lighter blue, muted grey)
    that visually reinforces the ranking
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed spines, subtle grid, explicit font sizing, well-calibrated
    margins'
  - Correct seaborn 0.14+ API usage with hue parameter and legend=False
  - Descriptive axis labels with units and correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - The color distinction between the lighter blue (#7BAFD4) middle bars and the muted
    grey (#A3BFCF) bottom bar is subtle and may not be immediately perceptible
  - The Lowest annotation arrow is quite long, spanning from upper-right area down
    to the Books bar, creating visual tension
  - Annotation positioning uses hardcoded pixel coordinates that are fragile if data
    changes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" showing product sales across 8 categories in descending order: Electronics
    (218), Groceries (195), Clothing (164), Sports (142), Toys (112), Home & Garden
    (89), Automotive (58), and Books (41). The top bar (Electronics) is dark Python
    Blue (#306998), the middle 6 bars are lighter blue (#7BAFD4), and the bottom bar
    (Books) is a muted grey-blue (#A3BFCF). Bold value labels appear above each bar.
    Two arrow annotations provide storytelling: "Top seller 218 units" points to the
    Electronics bar from the upper-right, and "Lowest 41 units" points down to the
    Books bar from the upper-right area. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category",
    the y-axis "Sales (units)". Top and right spines are removed, with a subtle y-axis
    grid (alpha=0.2). Layout uses white background with clean spacing.'
