review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the streaming concept using dual encoding (color gradient
    + alpha/opacity) to show point recency
  - Clean, idiomatic plotnine/ggplot2 code structure using proper grammar of graphics
  - Realistic sensor data scenario (temperature vs humidity) with appropriate random
    walk drift simulation
  - Proper title format and good overall visual design
  - Effective use of scale_alpha_continuous and scale_color_gradient for the streaming
    effect
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label unit formatting could use proper degree symbol (°C instead of C)
  - Some point overlap in dense regions makes older faded points harder to distinguish
  image_description: The plot displays a streaming scatter plot showing simulated
    sensor data with Temperature (C) on the x-axis (ranging from ~20 to ~22.5) and
    Humidity (%) on the y-axis (ranging from ~53 to ~59). The plot contains approximately
    200 data points. Points are colored using a gradient from blue (older points)
    to yellow (newer points) to indicate data age/recency. Additionally, older points
    have lower opacity (more transparent) while newer points are more opaque, creating
    a visual trail effect that simulates streaming data. The title follows the correct
    format "scatter-streaming · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in black text at the top. The
    background uses a minimal theme with light gray gridlines, and the layout is clean
    with adequate margins around the plot area. No legend is shown as the guides are
    intentionally hidden since the color and opacity encoding is self-evident from
    the visual pattern.
