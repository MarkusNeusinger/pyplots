review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with good use of pygal custom Style system
  - Value labels with dollar formatting enhance readability and practical use
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labels with units
  - Good bar spacing and proportions for a basic bar chart
  - Deterministic data with realistic retail sales scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently at default opacity)
  - Font sizes in the style are larger than library defaults but tick labels could
    be slightly larger for optimal legibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing "Quarterly sales
    by product category" with 6 categories: Electronics ($45,200), Clothing ($32,800),
    Home & Garden ($28,500), Sports ($19,700), Books ($15,300), and Toys ($12,400).
    All bars use a consistent Python Blue color (#306998). Value labels are positioned
    on top of each bar with dollar formatting. The title "bar-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Category" and y-axis "Sales ($)" with
    horizontal grid lines. The layout is clean with good proportions and adequate
    spacing between bars.'
