review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of crossover detection algorithm
  - Clean separation of price line prominence vs EMA line thickness
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Realistic synthetic stock price data with trend variations
  - Proper datetime axis handling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears slightly cropped at the right edge in the rendered image
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price time series with two Exponential
    Moving Average overlays spanning from January 2025 to June 2025. The main price
    line is rendered in dark blue (#306998), prominently showing price volatility.
    Two EMA lines are overlaid: a 12-period EMA in yellow (#FFD43B) and a 26-period
    EMA in red/coral (#E74C3C). The EMAs are thinner than the price line as specified.
    Purple circular markers indicate crossover points where the short EMA crosses
    the long EMA - visible at approximately 6 locations throughout the chart. The
    chart shows realistic price movements including an uptrend, downtrend, and recovery
    pattern. The title "indicator-ema · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.
    A legend is positioned on the right side showing "Close Price", "EMA 12", "EMA
    26", and "Crossover Signal". Axes are labeled "Date" (x-axis) and "Price (USD)"
    (y-axis). Grid lines are subtle with dashed styling. The background is a light
    gray (#fafafa).'
