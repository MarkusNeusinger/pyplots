review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stacked area visualization with clear separation of all four product
    categories
  - Realistic retail revenue data with convincing seasonal patterns (December peaks)
  - Proper use of pygal StackedLine with fill=True for stacked areas
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good color palette with sufficient contrast between adjacent series
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner overlaps with the plot area; legend_at_bottom=True
    would be cleaner
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current y_guides are acceptable but could use
    lower opacity)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing monthly revenue
    by product category over 2 years (Jan 2023 - Dec 2024). Four categories are shown:
    Electronics (blue, bottom), Clothing (yellow), Home & Garden (green), and Books
    (red, top). The areas are properly stacked, with the cumulative total reaching
    peaks around 520K in December periods, showing clear holiday shopping seasonality.
    The legend is positioned in the top-left corner with colored squares. X-axis labels
    show month abbreviations at 45-degree rotation, Y-axis shows "Revenue ($K)". The
    title "area-stacked · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The chart
    has a white background with subtle horizontal grid lines.'
