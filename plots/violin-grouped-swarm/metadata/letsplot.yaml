review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color accessibility with blue/yellow palette that is colorblind-safe
  - Perfect spec compliance - implements all required features (grouped violins, swarm
    overlay, transparency, color matching)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of position_jitterdodge for point placement within violins
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful variation across groups
  - Proper use of alpha for violin transparency allowing points to show through
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned slightly closer to the plot area
  - Could leverage more of lets-plot distinctive interactive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm overlay showing
    response times (in milliseconds) across three task types (Simple, Moderate, Complex)
    and two expertise levels (Novice and Expert). Blue (muted steel blue, #306998)
    represents Novice and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) represents Expert. Each category has
    two side-by-side violin plots with individual data points overlaid inside them.
    The violins have approximately 50% transparency allowing the points to be visible.
    The distributions show clear patterns: Novice users have higher response times
    and wider spreads than Experts across all task types, with the difference most
    pronounced in Complex tasks. The title follows the correct format "violin-grouped-swarm
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" and is displayed prominently at the top. The legend is
    positioned on the right side showing both groups with colored markers. Axis labels
    are descriptive with units ("Response Time (ms)" on Y-axis, "Task Type" on X-axis).
    The overall layout is clean with a minimal theme and no x-axis grid lines.'
