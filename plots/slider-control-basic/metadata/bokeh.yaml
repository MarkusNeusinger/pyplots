review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features with CustomJS callback for real-time
    slider updates
  - Well-structured data generation with realistic seasonal patterns and growth trends
    across 7 years
  - 'Good color scheme using Python brand colors (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Proper title format that dynamically updates with the selected year
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Both HTML (interactive) and PNG (static) outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - The static PNG cannot demonstrate the slider functionality - consider adding annotation
    or visual indicator showing this is part of an interactive widget
  - No legend explaining what the yellow line/markers represent vs the blue bars
  - Slider width (800px) may appear small relative to the 4800px plot width in HTML
