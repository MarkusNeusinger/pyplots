review:
  strengths:
  - Proper rose chart implementation with radial segments where radius represents
    values
  - Colorblind-friendly distinct color palette for all 12 months
  - Radial gridlines at 25/50/75/100 mm with labels for scale reference
  - Value labels positioned intelligently to avoid crowding on smaller segments
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Chart occupies only upper-left quadrant of canvas leaving excessive whitespace
    in lower portion
  - Month labels missing from outer edge - only values shown without category context
    on chart itself
  - Legend placed far to the right isolated from the chart rather than integrated
  image_description: The plot displays a rose chart (Nightingale/coxcomb diagram)
    showing monthly rainfall data in a radial format. The chart features 12 colorful
    wedge segments representing each month, with radius proportional to rainfall values
    (ranging from 22mm for July to 92mm for November). Colors used include Python
    blue (Jan), yellow (Feb), teal (Mar), coral (Apr), mint (May), salmon (Jun), sage
    (Jul), gold (Aug), sky blue (Sep), lavender (Oct), pink (Nov), and seafoam (Dec).
    Two dashed concentric gridlines appear at approximately 75mm and 100mm levels
    with labels on the right side. Value labels (22-92) are positioned near each segment.
    A legend in the upper right lists all months with their corresponding colors.
    The title "rose-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The chart is
    positioned in the upper portion of the canvas with significant empty space below.

        comment: Good use of mark_arc, layered composition, and polar coordinates;
          however post-processing with PIL for cropping detracts from pure Altair
          solution
  verdict: APPROVED
