review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three required curves (model, baseline, perfect
    model)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good color choices that are colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Realistic customer response scenario with appropriate beta distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show exact values on hover (bokeh interactive
    strength)
  - Legend border line is slightly heavy at 2px width
  - Text sizes could be increased slightly for better readability at full resolution
