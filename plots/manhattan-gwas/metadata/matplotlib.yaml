review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chromosome visualization with alternating blue colors providing clear
    visual distinction between chromosomes
  - Proper highlighting of significant SNPs with larger red markers and white edges
    that stand out clearly
  - Realistic GWAS data simulation with appropriate chromosome sizes, SNP densities,
    and significant peaks on specific chromosomes
  - Clean code structure with good use of rasterized=True for performance optimization
    with 110k+ data points
  - Both genome-wide and suggestive threshold lines included with clear legend
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines present (minor - acceptable for Manhattan plots to reduce clutter)
  - Y-axis label could include clearer notation
