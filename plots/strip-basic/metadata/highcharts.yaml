review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with distinct, well-chosen colors
  - Clear demonstration of strip plot concept with meaningful jitter
  - Mean markers provide useful reference points for comparison
  - Realistic educational data context (test scores by subject)
  - Bimodal distributions in Math and Literature showcase data variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  - Interactive HTML export alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (should be "Test Score (%)" or similar)
  - Some point overlap in dense regions could benefit from slightly smaller markers
    or more transparency
  - Legend positioned far from the data in top-right corner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a strip plot with four categories (Mathematics,
    Science, Literature, History) arranged horizontally along the x-axis. Each category
    shows individual data points (student test scores) scattered vertically with random
    horizontal jitter. The colors used are: blue (#306998) for Mathematics, yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Science, purple (#9467BD) for Literature, and cyan (#17BECF) for
    History. Red diamond markers indicate the mean for each category. The title "strip-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Student
    Test Scores by Subject". The y-axis shows "Test Score" ranging from 40 to 106,
    and the x-axis shows "Subject". A legend is positioned in the top-right corner
    listing all categories plus the Mean marker. The background is white with subtle
    dashed gray grid lines.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts scatter series with custom markers, tooltips, and
          interactive HTML export. Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features
          like data labels or animations.
