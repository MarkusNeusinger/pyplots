review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with inverted Y-axis correctly placing rank 1 at top
  - Clean color palette starting with Python blue (#306998) as first color
  - Well-positioned legend outside plot area preventing data overlap
  - Data shows interesting narrative with multiple overtakes and rank changes
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with hue for categorical grouping
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., "Competition Week" and "League Position")
  image_description: 'The bump chart displays 5 sports teams (Lions, Tigers, Bears,
    Eagles, Wolves) with their ranking positions tracked over 6 weeks (Week 1-6).
    The Y-axis shows ranks 1-5 with rank 1 at the top (inverted axis as required).
    Each team is represented by a distinct colored line with circular markers: Lions
    (blue #306998), Tigers (yellow), Bears (red), Eagles (green), and Wolves (purple).
    Lines connect the rankings across weeks showing position changes. The title follows
    the correct format "bump-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right
    side clearly identifies each team. The grid is subtle with dashed lines at alpha
    0.3.'

        comment: Uses seaborn's lineplot with hue grouping and palette, which is good
          but relatively basic seaborn usage
  verdict: APPROVED
