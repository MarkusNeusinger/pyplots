review:
  strengths:
  - Clean viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility and visual
    appeal
  - Good layout with properly sized figure (16:9 aspect ratio)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clear axis labels with appropriate units (km)
  - Smooth contour transitions showing the bimodal structure effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Missing contour level labels as recommended in the spec
  - Seaborn used only for styling, not for plotting - consider using sns.kdeplot()
    for native seaborn contour capabilities
  - Colorbar label shows Probability Density but geographic km units suggest elevation/topographic
    data would be more contextually appropriate
  - Grid styling from sns.set_theme is obscured by the filled contour
