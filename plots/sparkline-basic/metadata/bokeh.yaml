review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sparkline minimalism - no axes, gridlines, or labels as spec requires
  - Perfect 4:1 aspect ratio ideal for sparkline visualization
  - Good use of colored markers to highlight min (red) and max (green) points
  - First and last points highlighted for reference as spec suggests
  - Clean data generation with realistic website traffic scenario including trend
    and seasonality
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size could be slightly larger for the 4800x1200 canvas
  - Consider using ColumnDataSource for better Bokeh idiom (minor)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a minimalist sparkline visualization with
    a blue line (#306998) showing 30 data points representing daily website traffic.
    The line exhibits a general upward trend combined with weekly seasonality patterns.
    The chart correctly omits all axes, gridlines, and labels in keeping with sparkline
    conventions. Four highlighted points are visible: a small blue dot at the first
    point (left edge), a small blue dot at the last point (right edge), a red dot
    marking the minimum value, and a green dot marking the maximum peak. The aspect
    ratio is approximately 4:1 (4800x1200 pixels), which is ideal for sparklines.
    The title "sparkline-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in
    a readable font.'

        comment: Basic Bokeh usage; could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic
          code, but scatter/line methods are appropriate
  verdict: APPROVED
