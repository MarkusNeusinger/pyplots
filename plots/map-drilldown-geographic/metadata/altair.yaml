review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-structured hierarchical data model with regions and states
  - Good use of Altair selection_point for interactive drill-down concept
  - Clean layout with map and sidebar charts composition
  - Appropriate axis labels with units
  - TopoJSON integration for US state boundaries works correctly
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Choropleth colors do not render in static PNG - the empty=True selection
    parameter does not cause colors to appear on the map; the transform_lookup color
    encoding is not working in the exported PNG'
  - Regional bar chart colors also render as gray instead of their designated region
    colors (blue/red/green/yellow)
  - The States in Selected Region panel is completely empty in static view, wasting
    ~40% of the right sidebar space
  - Color legend at bottom-left is misleading since no colors are visible on the map
  - The drill-down functionality cannot be demonstrated in a static image - the implementation
    is designed for HTML interactivity but fails to show a meaningful static view
  image_description: The plot displays a US geographic map with a drill-down navigation
    concept. The main title "map-drilldown-geographic · altair · pyplots.ai" is prominently
    shown at the top with subtitles explaining the interaction. The left portion contains
    a US map showing all state boundaries outlined in white, but all states appear
    in uniform light gray color - the choropleth coloring is NOT visible in the static
    PNG export. A color legend appears at bottom-left showing "Sales ($K)" scale from
    0-500 using a blue gradient scheme. On the right side, there is a horizontal bar
    chart showing regional sales totals (South, West, Midwest, Northeast) all rendered
    in gray. A region color legend at the top-right shows 4 colors (blue=West, red=South,
    green=Midwest, yellow=Northeast), but these colors are not applied to the bars
    in the static view. Below the region chart is an empty "States in Selected Region"
    panel with placeholder text "Click a region bar to view states".

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative syntax, selections, TopoJSON, and layering.
          However, the selection parameter configuration fails to produce visible
          colors in static PNG export.
