review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of motion trail effect using ghost needles with progressive
    alpha values
  - Clean, professional visual design with intuitive green/yellow/red color zones
  - Creative use of plotnine grammar of graphics to build gauge from polygons and
    segments
  - Good canvas utilization with well-balanced layout
  - LIVE indicator adds authenticity to real-time simulation
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Ghost needle positions are very close together (58, 62, 65, 67) making the trail
    appear slightly bunched
  - Red-green color scheme is not optimal for red-green colorblind users
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart representing CPU
    Usage at 67%. The gauge arc is divided into three color zones: green (0-50), yellow
    (50-80), and red (80-100). The current value of 67% places the needle in the yellow
    zone. A motion trail effect is visible with multiple semi-transparent needle positions
    (at approximately 58%, 62%, and 65%) showing progressively increasing opacity,
    creating the illusion of real-time movement toward the current 67% position. The
    main needle is dark blue/charcoal with a center pivot point. Tick marks and labels
    appear at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 around the arc''s outer edge. Below the gauge,
    "67%" is prominently displayed in large bold text, followed by "CPU Usage" in
    gray, and a red "● LIVE" indicator. The title "gauge-realtime · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top.'
