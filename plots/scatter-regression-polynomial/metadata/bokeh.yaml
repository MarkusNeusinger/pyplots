review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario (manufacturing efficiency with diminishing returns)
    that perfectly demonstrates polynomial regression
  - R² value and polynomial equation are prominently displayed with clear formatting
  - Good color contrast between scatter points (blue) and regression curve (yellow)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom right is far from the main data area; would be better
    near the annotation or top-left
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive point inspection which is a key Bokeh strength
  - Annotation text size (22pt) is adequate but could be larger (24-26pt) for better
    visibility at full resolution
