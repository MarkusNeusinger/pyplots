review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent ghost bar technique to show motion/transition effect for real-time visualization
  - Clean annotation system showing change direction and magnitude with triangles
  - Good use of Highcharts annotations module for change indicators
  - Realistic service monitoring scenario with appropriate data
  - Proper title format and LIVE indicator in subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme for change indicators is not colorblind-safe (use blue/orange
    instead)
  - Legend is enabled but may not be clearly visible; should verify Previous/Current
    distinction is clear
  - Previous values calculation allows negative changes that seem arbitrary (-30 to
    +50 range)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a column (vertical bar) chart showing service
    throughput metrics for 6 services: API Gateway, Auth Service, Database, Cache,
    Queue, and CDN. Each service has two bars - a gray "Previous" bar (semi-transparent
    at 40% opacity) and a colored "Current" bar (blue #306998 for increases, purple
    #9467BD for decreases). The current values are labeled on top of each bar (208,
    420, 256, 221, 338, 170). Above the current values, change indicators show the
    difference with green upward triangles (▲) for positive changes and red downward
    triangles (▼) for negative changes. The title follows the correct format "bar-realtime
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a green "● LIVE — Service Throughput (requests/sec)"
    subtitle. The Y-axis shows "Requests per Second" and X-axis shows "Service" with
    category labels. Grid lines are subtle gray. The chart effectively demonstrates
    the real-time nature through the ghost bar motion effect.'
