review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of gradient fill from specification notes (alpha 0.3-0.5)
  - Proper title format exactly matching the required pattern
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of weekly cyclical pattern in data making the visualization interesting
  - Proper container-based screenshot approach for accurate chart dimensions
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 0 creating large empty space below the data (could use min property)
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Daily Visitors (count)" or "Day of Month (date)")
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like hover tooltips or animation
