review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts arearange series for band visualization with proper
    upper/lower bounds
  - Very clear visual hierarchy with contrasting band (blue, 0.3 alpha) and center
    line (yellow, solid)
  - Heteroscedastic uncertainty pattern demonstrates the value of band plots effectively
  - Proper zIndex layering ensures center line renders on top of band
  - Large, readable text sizes throughout (64px title, 48px axis labels, 36px tick
    labels)
  - Clean Selenium-based PNG export with proper image cropping
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (s)" or "Value (units)" would be more informative)
  - Uses raw dictionary configuration instead of highcharts-core Python library classes
    as shown in library rules
  - Legend could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a band chart with a light blue semi-transparent
    area representing the 95% confidence interval, and a golden-yellow center line
    showing the mean value. The visualization follows a sinusoidal pattern over time
    (x-axis: 0-10), with values ranging approximately from 24 to 104 on the y-axis.
    The uncertainty band visibly widens as time increases, demonstrating heteroscedastic
    behavior. The title "band-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in bold, with a subtitle "Time series with 95% confidence interval". A legend
    in the top-right corner identifies both the confidence interval band and mean
    value line. The background is clean white with subtle dashed grid lines.'
