review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent marker visibility with white edge borders creating strong contrast against
    lines
  - Three distinct marker shapes (circle, square, triangle) for easy series differentiation
  - Realistic weather station scenario with plausible temperature ranges
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate filled vs unfilled markers as suggested in spec notes for additional
    distinction
  - Legend placement inside plot area could potentially overlap with data in edge
    cases
  - Does not leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like annotations or custom
    styling
