review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of classic wind rose visualization with proper compass
    orientation (N at top, clockwise)
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette with good visual separation between
    stacked segments
  - Appropriate use of square aspect ratio for radial chart
  - Clear data story showing prevailing winds from W direction with realistic stacked
    speed categories
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside plot area could be better integrated (consider inside
    upper portion)
  - Radial labels (percentage) could include units in ylabel or subtitle for complete
    context
  - The figsize of 12x12 may not match the expected 3600x3600 at 300dpi (would be
    3600x3600 but library guidelines suggest 16x9)
