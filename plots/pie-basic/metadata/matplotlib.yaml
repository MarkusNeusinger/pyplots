review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of spec-required features: percentage labels, distinct colors,
    legend, and exploded slice'
  - Clean visual design with white edge lines separating slices
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette with sufficient contrast
  - Category labels positioned clearly without overlap
  - Percentage labels are bold white for good readability
  - Appropriate square format for pie charts
  - Title correctly follows required format
  weaknesses:
  - Generic product names instead of more realistic category names
  - Could use shadow or additional visual enhancements
  - Legend title is generic - could match data context
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart with 5 slices representing market
    share distribution for Products A through E. The largest slice (Product A at 35%)
    is slightly exploded/offset from the center for emphasis. Colors used are: deep
    blue (#306998) for Product A, golden yellow (#FFD43B) for Product B, teal (#4ECDC4)
    for Product C, coral red (#FF6B6B) for Product D, and gray (#95A5A6) for Product
    E. Each slice has a bold white percentage label centered within it. Category labels
    (Product A-E) appear around the perimeter of the pie. A legend is positioned on
    the right side with "Categories" as its title. The title "pie-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. White edge lines separate each slice for visual
    clarity. The chart uses a square format appropriate for pie charts.'
