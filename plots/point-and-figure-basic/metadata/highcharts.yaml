review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of P&F chart logic with proper column-based structure
  - Creative use of data labels to render X and O characters instead of traditional
    markers
  - Good separation of X and O series for proper coloring and legend
  - Proper box size and 3-box reversal implementation
  - Clean subtitle with chart parameters
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing support/resistance trend lines mentioned in the specification notes
  - Legend shows square symbols instead of X/O characters (Highcharts limitation)
  - Uses a helper function to_box() instead of inline code (minor KISS violation)
  - Red color for Os could be changed to a more colorblind-friendly option like orange
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Point and Figure (P&F) chart with 8 columns
    (0-7) on the X-axis representing reversals, and price values ($76-$136) on the
    Y-axis. Blue "X" characters mark rising price columns, while red "O" characters
    mark falling price columns. The chart shows a clear pattern: column 0 starts with
    X''s rising from ~$100 to ~$110, column 1 shows O''s falling from ~$108 to ~$96,
    column 2 has X''s rising from ~$100 to ~$112, column 3 shows a deep O decline
    from ~$110 to ~$80, column 4 has X''s rising from ~$82 to ~$90, column 5 shows
    O''s at ~$84-88, column 6 has a strong X rally from ~$88 to ~$132, and column
    7 shows O''s falling from ~$130 to ~$112. The title correctly shows "point-and-figure-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle indicating "$2 Box Size | 3-Box Reversal
    | Simulated Stock Data". A legend in the top-right shows "X (Rising)" in blue
    and "O (Falling)" in red. Grid lines are subtle and the layout is clean with good
    proportions.'
