review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using 2D projection to simulate 3D wireframe in Bokeh which
    lacks native 3D support
  - Clean wireframe rendering with appropriate line width and alpha transparency
  - Custom 3D axis system with arrows adds clarity to the visualization
  - Correct title format and good canvas utilization
  - Python Blue color provides good visibility against light background
  weaknesses:
  - Formula annotation (z = sin(sqrt(x² + y²))) not visible in the rendered image
  - Axis tick marks not present as specified in requirements
  - X and Y axis labels positioned at edges are relatively small compared to wireframe
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D wireframe surface showing the ripple function
    z = sin(sqrt(x² + y²)). The wireframe is rendered in Python Blue (#306998) with
    a 30x30 grid creating a smooth, see-through mesh. The surface shows a central
    peak with concentric wave-like ripples extending outward, viewed from a 3D perspective
    (elevation 30°, azimuth 45°). Three custom axis lines (X, Y, Z) are positioned
    at the projected origin with arrows and bold labels. The title "wireframe-3d-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The background is a light gray
    (#f8f9fa) providing good contrast with the blue wireframe.
