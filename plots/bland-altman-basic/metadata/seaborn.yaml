review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Bland-Altman statistics with correct mean difference
    and LoA calculations
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors for bias line (yellow) vs limits of
    agreement (red)
  - Appropriate use of transparency and marker sizing for 80 data points
  - Annotations on the right side provide quick reference to exact values
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate units throughout
  - Zero reference line helps contextualize whether differences are clinically significant
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid and legend styling could be refined (VQ-07: grid alpha could be lower, legend
    framealpha competes with data region)'
  - 'Library features (LF-01): Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like
    rugplot for marginal distributions or confidence intervals'
