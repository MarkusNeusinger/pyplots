review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear pyramid shape and symmetric axis presentation
  - Smart use of negative values for left-extending bars creates proper butterfly
    layout
  - Custom hover templates with formatted population numbers enhance interactivity
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast between blue and yellow
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic demographic data showing expected patterns (female longevity, working-age
    bulge)
  weaknesses:
  - Could add annotations to highlight key insights (e.g., gender ratio differences
    in elderly groups)
  - Population scale could be documented in code comments for context
