review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of custom SVG hexagon path with mark_point for hexbin visualization
  - Realistic GPS coordinate data with three distinct density clusters creating meaningful
    spatial patterns
  - 'Good visual polish: viridis colormap, white hex strokes, subtle grid, and explicitly
    set font sizes'
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels too dense (every 0.002 degrees, ~30 labels) creating visual
    noise
  - Manual hexbin computation is verbose at ~30 lines of hex grid math
  - No log scale considered for color mapping despite ~120x density variation
  - Design not yet at publication quality — background and composition could be more
    refined
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization of GPS traffic
    density in a metropolitan area (Seattle, based on coordinates ~-122.3°W, ~47.6°N).
    Hexagons are rendered using the viridis colormap, ranging from dark purple (low
    vehicle count ~0) to bright yellow (high count ~120+). Three distinct density
    clusters are visible: a large downtown core cluster in the center-left area showing
    moderate density (teal/green), a compact shopping district hotspot on the right
    side with the highest peak density (bright yellow hexagons), and a smaller industrial
    zone cluster in the upper-left with moderate density. The x-axis is labeled "Longitude
    (°W)" with values from -122.37 to -122.30, and the y-axis is labeled "Latitude
    (°N)" from 47.586 to 47.644. A gradient color bar legend on the right shows "Vehicle
    Count" from 0 to 120+. The title "hexbin-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. Hexagons have thin white strokes providing clean separation. The y-axis
    has very dense tick labels (every 0.002°).'
