# donut-labeled: Donut Chart with Percentage Labels

## Description

A ring-shaped chart (donut chart) displaying categorical data distribution with percentage labels on each segment. The central hole distinguishes it from traditional pie charts, creating a cleaner aesthetic that draws attention to the segments rather than the center. Percentage labels directly on each slice make values immediately readable without requiring legend lookup.

## Applications

- Budget allocation visualization showing department spending percentages
- Market share distribution comparing competitor portions
- Survey response breakdown displaying answer frequencies
- Portfolio composition showing investment category weights

## Data

- `category` (categorical) - descriptive name for each segment
- `value` (numeric) - raw value or percentage for each category
- Size: 5-6 categories for optimal readability
- Example: departmental budget allocation or market share data

## Notes

- Inner radius should be approximately 50-60% of outer radius for classic donut appearance
- Percentage labels should be positioned on or near each segment for clarity
- Include a clean legend for category names
- Consider using a cohesive color palette with sufficient contrast between adjacent segments
