review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.clustermap for hierarchical row-clustering, showcasing a
    distinctive seaborn capability
  - Well-crafted synthetic data with intentional patterns that create a meaningful
    story (Sales strong early, Engineering strong late, Finance stable)
  - All font sizes explicitly set with good readability at target resolution
  - Realistic business context with sensible performance score range
  weaknesses:
  - Missing Y-axis label (Department) — the ylabel is set to empty string
  - Manual colorbar creation via ScalarMappable after disabling built-in cbar (cbar_pos=None)
    is unnecessarily verbose — could use the built-in colorbar support
  - Custom diverging palette via sns.diverging_palette(240, 10) is not a standard
    colorblind-safe colormap — consider using RdBu_r or coolwarm for better accessibility
  - 'Could push design further: no spine removal, no background color refinement,
    annotation font could be larger'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered heatmap of monthly department
    performance scores (0-100) for seven departments (Sales, Finance, Engineering,
    Operations, Marketing, Support, HR) across twelve months (Jan-Dec). A diverging
    blue-to-red colormap is used, centered at 50 — blue indicates low scores, red
    indicates high scores. Each cell contains a white-text integer annotation of the
    performance value. A dendrogram on the left groups departments by similarity via
    hierarchical row-clustering (columns are not clustered). A vertical colorbar on
    the right is labeled "Performance Score" with a 0-100 range. White gridlines separate
    each cell. The title "heatmap-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    center. The X-axis is labeled "Month" and department names appear on the right
    Y-axis. Clear patterns are visible: Sales strong first half fading later, Engineering
    strong second half, Finance consistently high (~80-90), HR with lower scores mid-year.'
