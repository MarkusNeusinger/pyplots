review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen transparency (alpha=0.5) that reveals
    overlapping distribution regions
  - Realistic business context (employee response times by department) with appropriate
    data characteristics
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes, subtle grid, and well-positioned
    legend
  weaknesses:
  - Bins are calculated independently for each histogram rather than being explicitly
    aligned across all groups (spec recommends aligned bin edges)
  - Could use more idiomatic seaborn approach with DataFrame and hue parameter instead
    of three separate histplot calls
  image_description: The plot displays three overlapping histograms showing employee
    response times (ms) by department. Engineering (blue) is centered around 450ms
    with a tight distribution, Marketing (yellow) has a wider spread centered around
    520ms extending to ~900ms, and Sales (pink/coral) shows a consistent mid-range
    distribution around 480ms. The transparency (alpha=0.5) effectively reveals overlapping
    regions where distributions intersect. The title "histogram-overlapping · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, with a clear legend in the upper right corner.
    Axis labels include units, and a subtle dashed y-axis grid aids readability.
