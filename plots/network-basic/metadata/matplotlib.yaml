review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation from scratch - nodes cluster by
    community naturally
  - Clean, readable node labels with good contrast (bold text on colored backgrounds)
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with four distinct colors
  - Node size encodes degree (connectivity) as suggested in spec
  - Well-organized code with clear comments explaining each section
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels are generic (Group A/B/C/D) rather than thematic
  - Edge rendering could benefit from curved edges or arrows to show connection direction
