review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of compass-style polar configuration (North at top, clockwise direction)
    making the wind data intuitive to interpret
  - Good color-coded time-of-day categorization with realistic clustering patterns
    showing prevailing wind directions
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate marker sizing and alpha for the data density (120 points)
  - Proper axis labeling with units and correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned too far from plot (bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1.0)) creating unnecessary
    whitespace; could be positioned closer or inside the plot
  - Could use matplotlib distinctive features more (e.g., colorbar for continuous
    third variable, custom tick formatters, or annotation capabilities)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar scatter plot for wind measurement
    data with a compass-style orientation (North at top, clockwise direction). Data
    points are positioned by wind direction (angle) and wind speed (radius, 0-20 m/s).
    Three categories are shown: Morning (blue circles) clustered around SW direction,
    Afternoon (yellow circles) clustered around NW direction, and Evening (brown circles)
    distributed across all directions. The title "polar-scatter · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top center. A "Time of Day" legend is positioned in the upper right.
    Radial gridlines appear at 10 and 20 m/s intervals. The axis label "Wind Speed
    (m/s)" appears on the left side.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib's polar projection and compass configuration (set_theta_zero_location,
          set_theta_direction, set_thetagrids), but these are standard polar features
          rather than distinctive matplotlib strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
