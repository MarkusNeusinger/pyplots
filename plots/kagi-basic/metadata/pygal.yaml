quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Kagi chart algorithm implementation with proper yang/yin state transitions
  - Clear visual distinction between bullish (green) and bearish (red) segments
  - Appropriate use of pygal XY chart for custom line drawing
  - Good title format and axis labeling with units
  - Creative CSS injection workaround to achieve different line thicknesses
  weaknesses:
  - Legend visual representation does not accurately show the line styles (thick vs
    thin) - shows generic markers instead
  - Reliance on post-render SVG/CSS manipulation indicates pygal limitations for this
    chart type
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart with the title "kagi-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The chart shows price movements on the Y-axis labeled
    "Price ($)" ranging from approximately 82 to 113, and the X-axis labeled "Kagi
    Line Index" ranging from 0 to 20. Green thick lines represent Yang (Bullish) segments
    and red thin lines represent Yin (Bearish) segments. The chart shows an initial
    decline from ~108 to ~82, followed by a volatile recovery pattern with multiple
    reversals, eventually reaching highs around 113 before a final decline. The legend
    at the bottom displays "Yang (Bullish) ━━━" and "Yin (Bearish) ─" with colored
    indicators. The background is white with subtle horizontal grid lines.
