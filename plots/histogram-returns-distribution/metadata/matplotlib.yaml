review:
  strengths:
  - 'All specification requirements fully implemented: histogram, normal overlay,
    statistics box, tail highlighting'
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizes throughout
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/red)
  - Statistics box properly displays all required metrics with monospace font
  - Custom legend correctly identifies histogram regions and overlays
  - Data demonstrates clear departure from normality with fat tails
  weaknesses:
  - Legend incorrectly shows Actual Returns label as yellow when most histogram bars
    are blue (the Returns Distribution patch should be blue)
  - The extreme outlier at +20% compresses the main distribution visualization horizontally
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns distribution
    with blue bars representing the frequency density of returns. Yellow/gold colored
    bars highlight the tail regions beyond ±2 standard deviations. A red dashed normal
    distribution curve is overlaid for comparison, fitted to the data. A solid blue
    vertical line marks the mean at approximately 0.07%. Gray dotted vertical lines
    mark the ±2σ boundaries at approximately -4.4% and +4.5%. The x-axis shows "Daily
    Returns (%)" ranging from about -5% to over 20%, and the y-axis shows "Density"
    from 0 to 0.30. The title correctly uses the format "histogram-returns-distribution
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A statistics text box in the upper right displays
    Mean: 0.068%, Std Dev: 2.231%, Skewness: 3.895, Kurtosis: 35.850. The legend in
    upper left identifies "Actual Returns" (yellow), "Normal Distribution" (red dashed),
    and "Mean (0.07%)" (blue line). The data shows clear fat tails and extreme positive
    skewness with outliers extending to +20%, demonstrating departure from normality.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib.patches for custom legend, basic histogram with overlays.
          Good but not exceptional use of matplotlib features
