review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly styled error bars with
    visible caps
  - Perfect spec compliance including the required annotation explaining error bar
    meaning
  - Realistic lab experiment context that demonstrates the practical use case
  - Clean KISS code structure following all conventions
  - Asymmetric error bars correctly implemented showing realistic experimental variation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled (showlegend=False) - while the annotation works, a legend entry
    would be more standard
  - Could leverage Plotly hover templates to show exact values and error ranges on
    interaction
  - Error magnitude variation across groups is relatively uniform - more dramatic
    differences would better showcase the feature
  image_description: 'The plot shows a bar chart with 5 blue bars (#306998) representing
    treatment groups: Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C, and Treatment
    D. Each bar has dark vertical error bars with horizontal caps at the ends indicating
    asymmetric standard deviations. The y-axis shows "Response Value (%)" ranging
    from 0-90, and the x-axis shows "Treatment Group". The title reads "Lab Treatment
    Results · bar-error · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. An annotation
    in the upper right corner states "Error bars: ±1 SD (asymmetric)". The plot uses
    a clean white background with subtle horizontal grid lines. Treatment C has the
    highest response (~72%) with the largest error range, while Control has the lowest
    (~45%).'

          code
