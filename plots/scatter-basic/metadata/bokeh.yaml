review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with proper imports, data generation,
    plotting, and saving
  - Correct title format using the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate use of ColumnDataSource which is Bokeh best practice
  - Good grid styling with dashed lines and subtle alpha
  - Saves both PNG and HTML outputs as expected for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size appears too small for the 4800x2700 canvas; consider increasing size
    from 15 to 25-30 for better visibility
  - Missing hover tooltips which are a key Bokeh distinctive feature - add HoverTool
    to show x/y values on hover
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than demonstrating a realistic
    scenario with units
