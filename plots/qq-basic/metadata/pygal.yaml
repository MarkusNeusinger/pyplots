review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Beasley-Springer-Moro algorithm for calculating
    theoretical quantiles without scipy dependency
  - Clean, readable code structure with appropriate comments explaining the algorithm
  - 'Good choice of colors (blue #306998 for points, gray for reference) that are
    accessible and professional'
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart for scatter plot functionality
  - Reference line (y=x) is clearly visible and correctly implemented
  - Font sizes are well-scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Data demonstrates the key Q-Q plot feature of showing deviation from normality
    (right skew)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent; could benefit from more subtle styling
  - The inverse normal CDF calculation adds complexity; consider if scipy dependency
    would simplify the code
  - Marker size (dots_size=12) could be slightly larger for better visibility at this
    resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot with a white
    background. Blue circular markers (100 points) represent sample data points plotted
    against theoretical normal quantiles. A gray diagonal reference line (y=x) runs
    from bottom-left to top-right. The title "qq-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in dark gray text. The x-axis is labeled "Theoretical Quantiles" and
    the y-axis "Sample Quantiles", both ranging from approximately -2.8 to 2.8. A
    subtle grid is visible with light gray vertical and horizontal lines. The legend
    at the bottom shows "Sample Data" (blue) and "Reference (y=x)" (gray). The data
    points follow the reference line closely in the center but deviate in the upper
    tail (showing right skew as intended), demonstrating the plot's ability to reveal
    distribution characteristics.

          of deviation from normality. Context is generic but appropriate for a basic

        comment: Uses pygal's XY chart, custom Style configuration, and proper PNG/HTML
          rendering. The manual implementation of inverse normal CDF (Beasley-Springer-Moro
          algorithm) is notable but not a pygal-specific feature.
