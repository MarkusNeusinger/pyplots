review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot with cumulative=True and stat=proportion for
    native cumulative histogram support
  - Realistic web API response time scenario perfectly demonstrates percentile analysis
    use case
  - Well-designed percentile reference lines with both horizontal and vertical markers
    make it easy to read threshold values
  - Clean annotation styling with white background boxes and colored borders for excellent
    readability
  - Good color progression for percentile lines (yellow to orange to red) indicating
    increasing severity
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: The grid lines could be further reduced (alpha 0.2) as they compete slightly
    with the percentile reference lines'
  - 'Minor: Right-side whitespace after data ends (~500ms) could be reduced by setting
    xlim closer to the actual data range'
  image_description: 'The plot shows a cumulative histogram (step function) displaying
    web API response times on a blue filled area chart. The x-axis shows "Response
    Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to 600, and the y-axis shows "Cumulative Proportion"
    from 0.0 to just above 1.0. The histogram uses a muted blue color (#306998) with
    filled area and step edges. Four percentile reference lines are displayed: P50
    at 71ms (yellow), P90 at 359ms (orange), P95 at 403ms (red-orange), and P99 at
    461ms (crimson). Each percentile has both horizontal and vertical dashed lines
    intersecting at the percentile point, with labeled annotations in white boxes
    with colored borders. The title "histogram-cumulative · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The grid is subtle with alpha transparency.'

        comment: Excellent use of seaborn's `histplot` with `cumulative=True`, `stat="proportion"`,
          and `element="step"` parameters - these are seaborn-specific features that
          simplify cumulative histogram creation
  verdict: APPROVED
