review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Marimekko chart implementation with proper variable-width bars representing
    regional market sizes
  - Clear value labels on all segments with proper currency formatting ($xxxM)
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette using distinct blue, yellow, green, and red
  - Correct use of geom_rect for building the mosaic structure manually
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis region labels are slightly angled (15 degrees) which may not be necessary
    given sufficient space
  - Grid lines are removed entirely - subtle grid lines could help readers trace percentage
    values
