review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the S-N curve with all specification requirements
    met
  - Clear visualization with appropriate log-log scaling on both axes
  - Realistic simulated fatigue data using Basquin equation with proper scatter
  - All three reference lines (Ultimate, Yield, Endurance) clearly labeled with values
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of plotly_white template for publication-quality appearance
  - Good marker styling with contrasting border colors
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position overlaps with the fit line at the top of the plot area
  - Could leverage Plotly hover capabilities to show stress/cycles values on hover
  - Markers could use slight alpha for overlapping points at same stress levels
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) for steel fatigue
    testing. The X-axis shows "Cycles to Failure (N)" on a logarithmic scale from
    100 to 100M, with minor tick marks at 2 and 5 intervals. The Y-axis shows "Stress
    Amplitude (MPa)" on a logarithmic scale from 200 to 750. The main data consists
    of yellow circular markers with blue borders representing test data points, showing
    natural scatter across multiple stress levels. A solid blue line (Basquin Fit)
    runs through the data showing the power-law relationship. Three horizontal dashed
    reference lines are displayed: a red dashed line at 650 MPa (Ultimate Strength),
    a green dashed line at 450 MPa (Yield Strength), and a purple dashed line at 230
    MPa (Endurance Limit). The title "sn-curve-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. A legend in the upper right corner with a white semi-transparent background
    clearly identifies all five trace elements. The plot uses the plotly_white template
    with a clean white background and subtle gray gridlines.'
