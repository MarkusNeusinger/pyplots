review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of realistic European GDP data with proper ISO-3 country codes
  - Clean Viridis colorblind-safe color palette with appropriate value range
  - Well-formatted title following the required naming convention
  - Good use of Plotly geographic features (scope, projection, coastlines, ocean coloring)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Missing data countries shown gracefully in gray
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra prefix before the spec-id pattern
  - Country border lines could be slightly thicker for better boundary visibility
  - Could add hover templates to enhance interactive HTML with formatted GDP values
  image_description: The plot displays a choropleth map of Europe showing GDP per
    capita data using the Viridis color scale. Colors range from dark purple (low
    GDP ~10-20k USD) to bright yellow (high GDP ~120k USD). Luxembourg and Ireland
    appear in bright yellow/green (highest GDP), Scandinavian countries in teal/green,
    Western Europe (Germany, France, UK) in medium teal, and Eastern European countries
    (Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania) in dark purple (lowest GDP). Russia and non-included
    countries appear in gray (missing data). The title is centered at the top, a vertical
    colorbar legend on the right shows the GDP scale, coastlines are visible with
    light blue oceans, and country borders have subtle gray outlines.
