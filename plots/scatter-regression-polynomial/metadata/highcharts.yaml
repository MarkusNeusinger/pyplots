review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polynomial regression with R² and equation display
    in subtitle
  - Perfect title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic diminishing returns scenario (advertising spend vs revenue) perfectly
    demonstrates polynomial relationships
  - 'Clean colorblind-safe color palette (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Appropriate marker sizing (radius 12) and transparency (0.65) for 80 data points
  - SplineSeries creates a smooth, visually distinct regression curve
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text styling could be more prominent at current font sizes
  - Could leverage Highcharts-specific features like tooltip formatters or data labels
    for enhanced interactivity
  - Missing optional confidence band mentioned in spec (though marked as optional)
