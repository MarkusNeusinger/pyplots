review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (Python blue/yellow) that are
    both aesthetically pleasing and colorblind-safe
  - Perfect implementation of learning curve pattern showing the classic bias-variance
    tradeoff visualization
  - Proper use of seaborn styling (set_context, set_style) creating a polished, professional
    appearance
  - Text sizing follows best practices exactly (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Confidence bands are appropriately transparent (alpha=0.2) making overlapping
    regions visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Accuracy Score (0-1)" or "Training Set Size (samples)"
    would be clearer)
  - fill_between is used directly from matplotlib rather than a seaborn-native approach
  - Data scenario is generic rather than depicting a specific real-world ML application
