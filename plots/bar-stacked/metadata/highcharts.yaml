review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling showing energy transition narrative (solar growth,
    coal decline)
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette following Python branding guidelines
  - Stack totals displayed above each bar as recommended in specification
  - Data labels within segments aid precise value reading
  - Proper use of Highcharts stacking configuration with white borders between segments
  - Well-configured tooltips showing both individual and total values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement conflicts with X-axis title - they visually overlap
  - Data labels within segments could be slightly larger for better readability at
    full resolution
