review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with server response times across geographic
    regions
  - Clean stacking visualization with good color separation using white edge lines
  - All three distributions have distinct characteristics (different means, scales,
    and sample sizes)
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good use of alpha for slight transparency while maintaining visibility
  weaknesses:
  - No distinctive matplotlib features beyond basic histogram; could use annotations,
    custom spine styling, or statistical overlays
  - Legend visual separation could be enhanced with a border or better background
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked histogram showing server response
    times (in milliseconds) across three geographic regions. The x-axis shows "Response
    Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 10 to 140ms. The y-axis shows "Number of
    Requests" ranging from 0 to about 75. Three colored segments are stacked: US-East
    (blue/#306998), Europe (yellow/#FFD43B), and Asia-Pacific (green/#5BA85B). The
    US-East distribution peaks around 45ms, Europe around 65ms, and Asia-Pacific extends
    to higher values around 80-100ms. The title reads "histogram-stacked · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" and a legend is positioned in the upper right corner. White edge
    lines separate the bars, and a subtle y-axis grid is visible.'
