review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent center text implementation with Total $100K providing summary information
    as specified
  - Clean color palette with Python Blue as primary color and colorblind-safe secondary
    colors
  - Proper use of wedgeprops with width=0.5 creating a well-proportioned ring
  - White edge lines between segments provide clear visual separation
  - Percentage labels positioned within the ring at appropriate distance (pctdistance=0.75)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Category size distribution could be more varied to better demonstrate donut charts
    ability to compare proportions
  - Could benefit from slightly more contrast between adjacent segments (Operations
    light blue and Marketing blue are somewhat similar)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart with 5 segments representing
    budget allocation categories. The colors used are: blue (#306998) for Marketing
    (25.0%), yellow (#FFD43B) for Development (35.0%), light blue (#5BA0D0) for Operations
    (15.0%), sage green (#8FBC8F) for Sales (18.0%), and light pink (#DDA0DD) for
    Support (7.0%). Each segment displays its percentage in white bold text positioned
    within the ring. Category labels are placed outside the ring in black text. The
    center of the donut contains "Total $100K" in blue text. The title "donut-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark text. The chart uses white
    edge lines between segments for separation. Overall layout is balanced with good
    use of the square canvas.'

        comment: Values sum to 100% which is correct; "$100K" total is plausible but
          the "K" suffix with percentages that happen to sum to 100 is slightly confusing

        comment: Good use of wedgeprops for ring width and styling, pctdistance/labeldistance
          for positioning. Could have used matplotlib's more advanced features like
          shadow or explode.
  verdict: APPROVED
