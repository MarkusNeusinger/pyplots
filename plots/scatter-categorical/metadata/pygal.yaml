review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Iris-like data providing a realistic, scientifically meaningful
    context
  - Clean three-cluster separation clearly demonstrates categorical grouping
  - Good color palette (Python colors) that is colorblind-safe
  - Proper use of pygal custom Style with appropriately scaled font sizes for 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Alpha transparency (0.7) allows visibility of any overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-left overlaps with the plot area grid region; consider
    legend_at_bottom=True or repositioning
  - Marker stroke_width=0 removes outlines which could help distinguish overlapping
    points
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical scatter plot visualizing Iris-like
    flower measurements. Three distinct species clusters are shown: **Setosa** (blue,
    #306998) in the lower-left with small petal dimensions (length ~1-2cm, width ~0.1-0.5cm),
    **Versicolor** (yellow, #FFD43B) in the middle region (length ~3-5cm, width ~0.9-1.9cm),
    and **Virginica** (green, #2ca02c) in the upper-right (length ~4.5-7cm, width
    ~1.4-3cm). The title "scatter-categorical · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top center. Axis labels include units: "Petal Length (cm)" on X-axis and "Petal
    Width (cm)" on Y-axis. A legend with colored squares is positioned in the top-left
    corner. Subtle grid lines aid readability. The markers are well-sized dots with
    transparency (opacity 0.7) allowing overlap visibility.'
