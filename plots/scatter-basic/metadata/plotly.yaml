review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly set to appropriate values
  - Clean, realistic educational dataset with intentional outliers showing scatter
    plot utility
  - Proper use of plotly_white template creating a professional, clean appearance
  - Good code structure following KISS principle with reproducible seed
  - Interactive HTML export alongside PNG is a nice Plotly-specific touch
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the injected outliers (high-effort/low-result students,
    low-effort/high-result students) are present but not annotated or highlighted
    — missed opportunity to demonstrate scatter plot outlier-detection value'
  - No trend line or regression line to visualize the correlation, which would add
    analytical value
  - Design is clean but generic — looks like a configured default rather than publication-quality
    design
  - Graph Objects API is more verbose than needed; Plotly Express would be more idiomatic
    for this simple use case
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot of 120 data points representing
    student study hours (x-axis, 1–10 h) versus exam scores (y-axis, ~44–100%). Markers
    are steel-blue (#306998) circles with white edge lines and moderate transparency
    (alpha 0.7). The title "scatter-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top in a large font. Both axes have descriptive labels with units — "Study Hours
    (h)" and "Exam Score (%)". Light gray grid lines are present on a white background
    (plotly_white template). The data shows a clear positive linear correlation with
    natural scatter and a few visible outliers (e.g., high study hours with low scores,
    and low study hours with high scores). The layout is clean with balanced margins
    and good canvas utilization.

        comment: Uses go.Figure() + add_trace() which is correct but verbose for a
