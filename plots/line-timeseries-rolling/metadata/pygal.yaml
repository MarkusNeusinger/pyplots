review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between raw data (thin blue line) and rolling average
    (thick orange line) following spec guidance
  - Proper handling of rolling average with None values for first 6 days (pygal renders
    this as gaps correctly)
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices with Python Blue and contrasting Orange
  - Legend clearly indicates the 7-day window size as recommended by spec
  - Well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas with custom Style
  - Clean bi-weekly x-axis labeling prevents crowding
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility could be improved - x-axis guides are disabled (show_x_guides=False)
    while spec suggests grid lines on both axes improve readability
  - Font sizes in custom_style are larger than pygal.md guidelines suggest, though
    this works well for the output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series chart with the title "line-timeseries-rolling
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Temperature (°C)" and
    ranges from 0 to approximately 17. The X-axis is labeled "Date" with rotated labels
    showing dates from Jan 01 through Apr 15. Two line series are shown: a blue jagged
    line representing "Raw Temperature" data that shows considerable volatility, and
    an orange smoother line representing "7-Day Rolling Average" that tracks the underlying
    trend. The legend is placed at the bottom with both series clearly labeled. The
    raw data line is thinner while the rolling average line is thicker and more prominent.
    The overall visual shows a gradual warming trend from about 5°C in January to
    about 12°C in late April, with the rolling average smoothing out the day-to-day
    fluctuations. Grid lines are visible on the Y-axis. The plot utilizes a clean
    white background with good contrast.'

        comment: Both lines are clearly visible. Raw data line is thinner (width 2)
          and rolling average is thicker (width 6) as intended. Could benefit from
          slightly more differentiation.

        comment: Shows noisy raw data with clear underlying trend revealed by rolling
          average. Demonstrates seasonal warming pattern. Rolling average correctly
          starts after window period (None values for first 6 days).

        comment: Temperature values (0-17°C) are realistic for temperate winter-spring
          transition. Some noise values go slightly negative which is plausible for
          winter temps.

        comment: Uses pygal's Style customization, stroke_style for line differentiation,
          x_labels_major for sparse labeling, legend_at_bottom with columns. Good
          but not exceptional use of pygal-specific features.
  verdict: APPROVED
