review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and markers
  - Perfect use of post step style appropriate for cumulative data
  - Realistic data scenario (monthly cumulative sales) directly from spec applications
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color combination that is accessible and visually appealing
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai standards
  weaknesses:
  - Uses seaborn only for styling (sns.set_context) rather than seaborn plotting functions
    - this is essentially a matplotlib plot with seaborn theming
  - Legend label defined but not displayed (acceptable for single series)
