review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Good filled contour visualization using mark_rect with discrete color bands
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-structured data with two Gaussian peaks and a valley showing variation
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Contour line overlay using white points is unconventional and does not provide
    clear level identification as specified
  - The white point markers for contour lines create visual noise rather than clean
    isolines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization of a 2D scalar
    field using the viridis colormap. The image shows two prominent Gaussian peaks:
    one bright yellow peak at approximately (1, 1) and another slightly dimmer yellow-green
    peak at (-1, -0.5). There is also a subtle valley/depression near (0, 1.5) visible
    as a darker purple region. The X and Y axes are labeled "X Coordinate" and "Y
    Coordinate" respectively, ranging from -3 to 3. The title "contour-filled · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A colorbar on the right labeled "Intensity"
    shows the color mapping from approximately -0.2 (dark purple) to 1.2+ (bright
    yellow). The plot has good visual balance with the chart filling most of the canvas.
    White points are scattered throughout indicating contour level boundaries, though
    they appear as noise rather than clean isolines.'

        comment: Uses mark_rect for heatmap-style filled contours, proper encoding
          with scales, but doesn't leverage Altair's declarative strengths fully for
          this plot type
  verdict: APPROVED
