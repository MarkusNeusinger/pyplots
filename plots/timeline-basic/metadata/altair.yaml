review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents overlap perfectly
  - Creative inline legend implementation that integrates with the chart
  - Clean layered chart architecture using alt.layer() for composability
  - Good use of Altair declarative encoding system with proper type annotations
  - Appropriate color palette with good accessibility
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional detail on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Event labels at 16pt fontSize could be slightly larger (18pt) for better readability
  - Inline legend positioned close to top event labels, could use more vertical separation
  - Could add .interactive() to enable zoom/pan for exploring dense timelines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization for software
    project milestones spanning January 2024 to December 2024. A central gray horizontal
    axis line runs through the middle of the chart. Events are represented as colored
    circular markers connected to the axis by vertical lines, with labels alternating
    above and below the axis to prevent overlap. The color scheme uses four distinct
    colors for categories: blue (#306998) for Planning, yellow/gold (#E5A000) for
    Development, teal (#4ECDC4) for Testing, and coral/salmon (#E8575A) for Release.
    The inline legend at the top shows all four categories with their corresponding
    colored circles. Event labels are displayed in dark gray bold text. The x-axis
    shows dates in "Mon YYYY" format with labels angled at -45 degrees. The title
    "timeline-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.'
