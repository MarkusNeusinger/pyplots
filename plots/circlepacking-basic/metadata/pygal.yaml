review:
  strengths:
  - Good choice of organizational structure data with realistic headcount values
  - Title correctly formatted per specification
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow)
  - Creative approach using XML filters to extend pygal capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'Circle packing algorithm fails: departments render as concentric rings instead
    of sibling circles distributed within the root'
  - Only 3 of 17 leaf nodes (teams) are visible; rest are hidden or overlapping
  - Hierarchy structure is not visually apparent - cannot distinguish parent-child
    relationships
  - Code uses functions and classes, violating the KISS principle (imports → data
    → plot → save)
  - The visualization does not demonstrate the core concept of circle packing where
    siblings are packed side by side
