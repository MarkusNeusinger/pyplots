review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent candlestick implementation with proper anatomy (bodies and wicks clearly
    distinguished)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper data generation
  - Professional appearance with appropriate colors, font sizes, and subtle grid
  - Realistic stock price simulation with proper business day handling
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain green=bullish/red=bearish (helpful for non-financial
    audiences)
  - Wick linewidth (2) could be thinner (1-1.5) relative to body for better visual
    distinction per spec note
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 trading days
    of stock price data from January 2 to mid-February 2024. Green/teal candlesticks
    indicate bullish (price increase) days while red candlesticks indicate bearish
    (price decrease) days. Each candlestick clearly shows the body (open-close range)
    and wicks/shadows (high-low range). The price ranges from approximately $130 to
    $165, showing an initial uptrend peaking around Jan 10-15 followed by a downtrend.
    The title correctly displays "candlestick-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The
    x-axis shows dates formatted as "Jan 01", "Jan 08", etc. with weekly major ticks,
    and the y-axis shows "Price ($)". A subtle dashed grid helps read price levels.

        comment: Uses matplotlib primitives (Rectangle, plot) to build candlesticks
          manually; functional but doesn't leverage mplfinance or other specialized
          tools; appropriate for "basic" spec though
  verdict: APPROVED
