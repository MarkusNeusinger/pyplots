review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly inverted Y-axis with rank 1 at top per spec requirements
  - Python blue (#306998) used as primary color for Team Alpha
  - Clean, readable layout with no overlapping elements
  - Realistic sports league standings scenario that clearly demonstrates rank changes
  - Legend properly positioned outside plot area using bbox_to_anchor
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 output (16x9 at 300dpi)
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom two teams (Delta, Epsilon) have limited rank movement - could show more
    dramatic position swaps to better demonstrate bump chart capabilities
  - Axis labels lack units/context (though Period and Rank are descriptive for this
    use case)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing sports league standings
    for 5 teams (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon) over 6 weeks. The Y-axis is correctly
    inverted with rank 1 at the top. Each team is represented by a distinct colored
    line with circular markers: Team Alpha in Python blue (#306998), Team Beta in
    yellow/gold (#FFD43B), Team Gamma in green (#2ecc71), Team Delta in red (#e74c3c),
    and Team Epsilon in purple (#9b59b6). Lines connect each team''s position across
    weeks, clearly showing rank changes - for example, Team Alpha rises from 3rd to
    1st place, while Team Beta drops from 1st to 2nd. The chart has a subtle dashed
    grid, clear axis labels ("Period" and "Rank"), and a well-positioned legend outside
    the plot area on the right. The title correctly uses the format "bump-basic ·
    matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Good use of matplotlib axes methods, invert_yaxis, bbox_to_anchor
          for legend. Could use annotations or text labels for additional features.
  verdict: APPROVED
