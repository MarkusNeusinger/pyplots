review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with varied distributions showcasing all box plot features
    (outliers, different spreads, different medians)
  - Clean implementation of box plot statistics with proper IQR calculations
  - Good use of Bokeh's Whisker annotation for clean whisker rendering
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with readable text
  - Correct title format and clear axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive features (hover tooltips showing statistics
    would be valuable)
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Test Score (points)" for clarity)
  image_description: The plot displays a box-and-whisker plot comparing test score
    distributions across four classes (Class A, B, C, D). Each box shows the interquartile
    range (IQR) with a black median line. Class A has a blue box (~70-78 range), Class
    B has a yellow/gold box (~82-88 range) with a tight distribution, Class C has
    a light blue box (~57-80 range) showing the widest spread, and Class D has a gray
    box (~72-83 range). Whiskers extend appropriately and outliers are displayed as
    hollow circles - Class A has one low outlier (~49), Class B has outliers both
    above (~99) and below (~45-52), Class C has outliers above (~135) and below (~8),
    and Class D has outliers above (~103-108) and below (~40-42). The title reads
    "box-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" and axes are labeled "Class" (x-axis) and "Test
    Score" (y-axis). The layout is clean with a dashed horizontal grid.

        comment: Implementation manually calculates box plot statistics instead of
          using Bokeh's built-in capabilities. While functionally correct, it doesn't
          showcase Bokeh-specific features like hover tools or interactive elements
          that would distinguish it from other libraries.
  verdict: APPROVED
