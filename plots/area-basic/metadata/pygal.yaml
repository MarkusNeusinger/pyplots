review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of pygal cubic interpolation for smooth, visually appealing area
    curves
  - Strong data storytelling with peak/low markers and quantified trend line (+34
    visitors/day)
  - Carefully tuned custom Style with explicit font sizes, subtle dashed gridlines,
    and cohesive color palette
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with three distinct narrative phases (baseline,
    growth, peak plateau)
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (blue, orange, purple, teal) with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - No gradient fill from bottom to line as suggested by the spec (flat alpha fill
    instead)
  - Cubic interpolation slightly exaggerates curves between widely spaced data points,
    creating unrealistic dips
  - Peak/low series implemented via None-filled arrays is verbose; could be more elegant
  - Bottom legend spacing creates a slight visual gap from the data area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart of daily website visitors
    over 30 days on a white background. The main data series is rendered as a smooth
    cubic-interpolated filled area in semi-transparent blue (#306998 at ~40% opacity)
    with small blue dots at each data point. A dashed orange trend line runs diagonally
    upward across the chart, labeled "Trend (+34 visitors/day)" in the legend. A large
    purple dot marks the peak value of 2,150 visitors on Day 24, and a large teal/green
    dot marks the low of 890 visitors on Day 6. The Y-axis is labeled "Number of Visitors
    (count)" ranging from ~850 to ~2,150 with subtle horizontal dashed gridlines.
    The X-axis is labeled "Day of Month" with major labels at days 1, 5, 10, 15, 20,
    25, and 30. The title reads "Daily Website Visitors · area-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. A four-item legend sits at the bottom: Daily Visitors, Trend (+34
    visitors/day), Peak: 2,150, Low: 890. The overall layout is clean with balanced
    margins and good canvas utilization.'

        comment: Cubic interpolation (interpolate='cubic', interpolation_precision=250)
          is distinctive pygal feature. SVG-native tooltip_fancy_mode leverages pygal
          strengths.
