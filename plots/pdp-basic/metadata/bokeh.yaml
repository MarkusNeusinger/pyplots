review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including confidence band, rug
    plot, and zero-centering
  - Uses real ML workflow with sklearn partial_dependence function and GradientBoostingRegressor
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper reproducibility (random seeds)
  - Good use of Bokeh Band model for the confidence interval visualization
  - Appropriate text scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom-right could be improved; top_right or top_left would
    be safer
  - Axis labels lack units (though partial dependence is unitless, could add context
    like standardized units)
