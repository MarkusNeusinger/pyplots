review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological data example (enzyme activity curve) that perfectly demonstrates
    LOWESS smoothing on non-linear data
  - Clean color contrast between blue points and yellow LOWESS curve makes the relationship
    immediately clear
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correctly uses statsmodels LOWESS with appropriate smoothing fraction (0.4)
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be larger to match the canvas scale (currently 22pt vs 28pt
    axis labels)
  - Could add HoverTool to show individual point values in interactive version
  - Grid dashed style may be unnecessary - solid subtle lines would be cleaner
