review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot geom_pie() with layer_labels() for percentage formatting
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette with Python Blue as the primary color
  - Proper use of theme_void() for clean pie chart presentation
  - Correct title format and legend configuration
  - Well-structured, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No slice explosion for emphasis on key slice as suggested in spec notes
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with pie shifted left relative to legend
  image_description: 'The plot displays a pie chart showing market share distribution
    across 5 companies. Company A (Python Blue #306998) dominates with 35%, followed
    by Company B (Yellow #FFD43B) at 25%, Company C (Green #4CAF50) at 20%, Company
    D (Orange #FF7043) at 12%, and Company E (Purple #AB47BC) at 8%. Each slice is
    labeled with its percentage value. A vertical legend on the right identifies each
    company by color. The title "pie-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top in a readable font size.'
