review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized nodes and readable character labels
  - Arc height correctly proportional to connection distance, clearly showing long
    vs short-range relationships
  - Good use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) to handle overlapping arcs
  - Realistic character interaction scenario that demonstrates the plot type effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear data definition
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Connection Arc Height is misleading since arcs are drawn as patches
    not mapped to y-coordinates; consider removing y-axis entirely or using more abstract
    labeling
  - No legend to explain what arc thickness represents (interaction strength)
  - Grid lines add visual noise without providing value for this type of diagram
  - Seaborn usage is minimal - only sns.scatterplot for nodes while arcs require matplotlib
    patches
