review:
  strengths:
  - Clean seasonal temperature pattern with realistic daily variation demonstrates
    time series well
  - Excellent custom Style configuration with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Proper tooltip customization with formatted date and temperature values
  - Good axis labeling with units (°C) and descriptive titles
  - Smart x-axis label management showing only major labels every 30 days to prevent
    clutter
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static/interactive versions
  weaknesses:
  - PNG output is inherently static; the interactive features (hover, zoom, pan, range
    selection) specified in the spec are only available in the HTML output - this
    is a limitation of the PNG format, not a code issue
  - Single data series limits feature demonstration; could show multiple locations
    or metrics for comparison
