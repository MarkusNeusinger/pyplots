review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the theoretical bias-variance tradeoff visualization
  - Clear differentiation of all four curve components with distinct colors
  - Good use of annotations to label underfitting and overfitting regions
  - Formula annotation adds educational value
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar
  - Clean, readable code structure with appropriate data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Could add shaded regions to better indicate underfitting/overfitting zones (spec
    suggests this)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha)
  - Axis labels lack units (though unitless is acceptable for normalized theoretical
    values)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bias-variance tradeoff visualization on
    a clean white background using the lets-plot library. It shows four curves: a
    blue "Bias²" curve that decreases from ~2.0 to ~0.4 as model complexity increases;
    a yellow "Variance" curve that increases from ~0.0 to ~1.6; a gray horizontal
    "Irreducible Error" line at ~0.3; and a red "Total Error" curve showing the characteristic
    U-shape with minimum around complexity 4. A vertical dashed black line marks the
    "Optimal Complexity" point. Text annotations label the "Underfitting (High Bias)"
    zone on the left and "Overfitting (High Variance)" zone on the right. The formula
    "Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error" appears at the bottom. The
    legend is positioned on the right side. All text is clearly legible with appropriate
    sizing. The title follows the correct format: "curve-bias-variance-tradeoff ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai".'
