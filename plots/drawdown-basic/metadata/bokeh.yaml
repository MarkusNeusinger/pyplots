review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, Span, Label, varea'
  - Clean data generation with realistic market stress periods
  - Proper calculation of running maximum and drawdown percentage
  - Good visual hierarchy with filled area, line, and marker
  - Correct title format and professional styling
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit recovery point markers where drawdown returns to zero (new highs)
  - Could benefit from HoverTool for interactivity (Bokeh strength)
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800x2700
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart showing percentage decline
    from peak value over approximately 3 years (Jan 2022 - Jan 2025). The chart uses
    a red/salmon colored filled area (#DC3545 with alpha) extending from a zero baseline
    down to the drawdown values. The zero line at the top represents peak performance.
    Multiple drawdown periods are visible: initial drawdowns in early 2022 reaching
    around -20%, a recovery period mid-2023 where the asset briefly returns to near
    zero (new highs), followed by a severe drawdown period starting late 2023 that
    reaches the maximum drawdown of -44.2%. The maximum drawdown point is marked with
    a blue circle marker and labeled "Max DD: -44.2%" in blue text. The title "drawdown-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. Axis labels show "Date" on x-axis
    and "Drawdown (%)" on y-axis. A legend in the bottom left shows "Drawdown" and
    "Max Drawdown: -44.2%". The background is a light gray (#FAFAFA). The plot uses
    the full canvas well with balanced margins.'
