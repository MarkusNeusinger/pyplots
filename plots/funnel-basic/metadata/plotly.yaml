review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native go.Funnel trace type for optimal funnel visualization
  - Clear value and percentage labels inside each segment using textinfo=value+percent
    initial
  - Well-chosen color palette with Python Blue as primary creating visual distinction
    between stages
  - Proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with good margins and font sizing
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs leveraging Plotly interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The blue color gradient (4 shades of blue + yellow) could be improved for better
    accessibility - consider using a more varied colorblind-safe palette
