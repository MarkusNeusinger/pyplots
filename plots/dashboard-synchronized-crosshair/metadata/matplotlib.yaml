review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of synchronized crosshair concept for a static library
    with clear value annotations
  - Well-organized three-panel layout with proper spacing (hspace=0.05) and shared
    x-axis
  - Thoughtful color coding for volume bars (green=up, red=down) enhances data interpretation
  - Helpful footer note explaining the static demonstration nature for matplotlib
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes slightly below recommendations (title 22 vs 24, labels 18 vs 20) though
    still readable
  - RSI legend with 3 items in horizontal row (ncol=3) appears slightly crowded
  - Minor overlap between footer note text and Date x-axis label
  image_description: 'The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with
    three vertically stacked subplots sharing a common x-axis (dates from Jan 2024
    to Oct 2024). The top chart shows a blue line plot of Price ($) with light blue
    fill, ranging from ~$20 to ~$110. The middle chart displays Volume (M) as colored
    bar chart - green bars for price increases, red bars for price decreases. The
    bottom chart shows RSI values as a yellow/gold line with horizontal dashed reference
    lines at 30 (green, oversold) and 70 (red, overbought), with a gray filled zone
    between them. A synchronized vertical crosshair line (gray, solid) spans all three
    charts at approximately June 2024, with annotations showing "$88.63" on the price
    chart, "3.23M" on the volume chart, and "RSI: 53.6" on the RSI chart. Scatter
    markers highlight the crosshair intersection points on the price and RSI charts.
    A footer note explains this is a static demonstration of synchronized crosshairs
    for matplotlib.'

          RSI normalization creates somewhat artificial range
