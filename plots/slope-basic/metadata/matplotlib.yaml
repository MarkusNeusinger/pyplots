review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color coding using blue (#306998) for increases and yellow (#FFD43B)
    for decreases - colorblind accessible
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles with no unnecessary functions or
    classes
  - Both endpoint labels present as required by spec, with product names on left and
    values on right
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of font weights (bold) for emphasis on key elements
  - Legend clearly explains the color coding
  weaknesses:
  - Text overlap occurs where values are close together (Product G/D on left, multiple
    pairs on right side)
  - No random seed declaration even though data is deterministic - should include
    comment or seed for clarity
  - Could implement label collision detection/avoidance to prevent overlapping text
