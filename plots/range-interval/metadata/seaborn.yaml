review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized elements appropriate for the 4800×2700
    canvas
  - Effective use of color contrast between blue ranges and yellow max markers
  - Thoughtful addition of the freezing point reference line (0°C) for context
  - Custom legend clearly explains all visual elements
  - Realistic seasonal temperature pattern demonstrates the range-interval concept
    well
  - Proper seaborn integration with DataFrame-based plotting
  weaknesses:
  - Custom legend is created manually with Line2D while sns.scatterplot also adds
    legend entries (minor redundancy)
  - Range bars use matplotlib ax.plot rather than a seaborn-specific function (acceptable
    but less seaborn-native)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges for a temperate climate city. Each month (Jan-Dec) is represented by a
    vertical blue bar (#306998) connecting the minimum and maximum temperatures. Blue
    circular markers indicate minimum temperatures, and yellow/gold markers (#FFD43B)
    indicate maximum temperatures. The title "range-interval · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. A horizontal dashed gray reference line at 0°C (freezing
    point) adds context. The legend in the upper right clearly explains the three
    elements: Temperature Range (bar), Min Temperature (blue dot), and Max Temperature
    (yellow dot). The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from about -5 to 30,
    and the X-axis shows month abbreviations. A subtle dashed grid provides visual
    guidance. The seasonal pattern is evident with January showing the coldest range
    (approximately -4°C to 7°C) and July showing the warmest (approximately 20°C to
    30°C).'
