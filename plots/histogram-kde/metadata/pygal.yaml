review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using XY chart with step-like path to simulate histogram bars
    since pygal native Histogram has different semantics
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Gaussian kernel with Scott rule for
    bandwidth selection
  - Good color contrast between blue histogram and red KDE curve
  - Clean readable code structure with helpful comments
  - Proper density normalization so histogram and KDE are on comparable scales
  weaknesses:
  - KDE curve line could be more prominent (thicker stroke or bolder color) to stand
    out more clearly against the histogram fill
  - Grid configuration could include x-guides for better visual reference
  - Title uses regular dots instead of proper middle dot character
