review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label positioning above/below axis prevents text overlap
  - Clean category color-coding with proper legend showing all 5 project phases
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for categorical grouping in scatter plot
  - Proper 4800x2700 sizing with appropriate font sizes for the canvas
  - Realistic software project milestone scenario with logical progression
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Event label font size (18pt) could be slightly larger for better readability at
    full resolution
  - Legend positioned far from data area in top-right corner
  - Could benefit from Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool for interactivity
