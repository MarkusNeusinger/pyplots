review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required K-S test features are present (ECDFs,
    max divergence highlight, D statistic, p-value)'
  - Strong realistic data context using credit scoring with appropriate sample sizes
    and distributions
  - Good color choices that are colorblind-safe (blue/orange/red)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Effective use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, Label, explicit Legend,
    dual PNG+HTML export)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend rendered at bottom-right instead of intended top-left — the add_layout(legend)
    call needs a place argument to position correctly
  - Visual design is functional but not publication-grade — could benefit from spine
    removal, better whitespace management, and more visual hierarchy between the two
    ECDF lines
  - The step-function array construction is verbose and could be simplified
  - Data storytelling is minimal — both ECDFs have identical styling with no emphasis
    beyond the red annotation
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step-function lines on a white background. The blue line (#306998)
    represents "Good Customers" and the orange line (#E8833A) represents "Bad Customers"
    in a credit scoring context. The X-axis is labeled "Credit Score" ranging from
    ~300 to ~900, and the Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" ranging from 0
    to 1. A red vertical line segment (#D62728) at approximately x=580 highlights
    the point of maximum divergence between the two distributions, with red circle
    markers at both endpoints (~0.07 and ~0.81). A red annotation reads "D = 0.737,
    p < 0.001" next to the K-S segment. The legend is positioned in the bottom-right
    area of the plot and is quite small, with entries for "Good Customers", "Bad Customers",
    and "K-S Statistic". The title "ks-test-comparison · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top-left. Overall the plot clearly shows that bad customers accumulate
    at lower scores while good customers accumulate at higher scores, with a substantial
    K-S statistic indicating strong distributional separation.
