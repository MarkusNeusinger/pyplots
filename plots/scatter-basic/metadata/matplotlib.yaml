review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with two well-placed annotations (Underperformer and
    Ceiling effect) that guide interpretation
  - Professional aesthetic with viridis color mapping, white marker edges, and path
    effects on annotation text for readability
  - Perfect spec compliance — all required features (transparency, grid, labels, title
    format) present
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) with intentional outliers
    and ceiling effect demonstrating scatter pattern diversity
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle with fixed seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size s=120 is slightly above the recommended range of 50-100 for 120 data
    points, creating minor overlap in dense regions (lower-left cluster)
  - Colorbar adds visual interest but is somewhat redundant since it maps the same
    variable as the y-axis — a second variable would add more information
  - The Ceiling effect at 100% annotation arrow points to the general cluster area
    rather than a specific data point, which could be slightly more precise
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart of 120 data points mapping
    "Study Hours (per week)" (x-axis, range 0–13) against "Exam Score (%)" (y-axis,
    range 30–108). Points are colored using the viridis colormap mapped to exam score
    values (purple for low ~35%, yellow for high ~100%), with a vertical colorbar
    on the right labeled "Exam Score (%)". A dashed blue trend line is shown with
    legend text "Trend (r = 0.88)" in the lower right. Two annotations with arrows
    highlight key data features: "Underperformer" pointing to a mid-study, low-score
    outlier around (5, 48), and "Ceiling effect at 100%" pointing to the cluster of
    points capped at 100. Top and right spines are removed. Subtle dashed y-axis grid
    lines aid readability. All markers have white edge highlights. Title reads "scatter-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in medium weight. The layout is clean with balanced
    margins and good canvas utilization.'
