review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to create multi-panel decomposition using pygal by rendering
    individual charts and compositing with PIL
  - Excellent color choices for each component (blue, yellow, green, red) that are
    visually distinct and meaningful
  - Realistic CO2 data scenario with proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output, showcasing pygal SVG capabilities
  - Proper handling of NaN values in trend/residual components (displayed as gaps)
  - Good use of custom Style with appropriate font sizes and colors
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels are generic Value instead of context-specific labels (e.g., CO2
    ppm, Trend ppm, Seasonal Deviation, Residual)
  - Text appears slightly small for the target 4800x2700 resolution; font sizes could
    be increased
  - Code complexity is higher than ideal KISS structure due to multi-chart compositing
    approach
  - X-axis date labels could be more readable - currently shows every 6 months but
    text is small
