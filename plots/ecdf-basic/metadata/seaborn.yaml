review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional ECDF visualization using seaborn native ecdfplot function
  - Perfect text sizing following library guidelines (title 24pt, labels 20pt, ticks
    16pt)
  - Appropriate line width (3) for high-resolution output
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha=0.3, dashed) aids percentile reading without visual
    distraction
  - Correct y-axis range enforcement (0 to 1) per specification requirements
  - Good data size (200 observations) within recommended 50-500 range
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack context/units - Value could be more descriptive for a real-world
    scenario
  - Could leverage more seaborn ECDF features like stat=count or complementary=True
    to showcase library capabilities
  - Data context is generic (random normal samples) rather than a compelling real-world
    scenario
