review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three well-placed annotations highlighting bimodality,
    tight clustering, and outliers
  - Cohesive blue-teal color palette that is both aesthetically pleasing and colorblind-safe
  - Rich variety of distribution shapes across groups (normal, tight, bimodal, wide
    with outliers) making full use of the raincloud plot strengths
  - Clean horizontal orientation with proper cloud-above, rain-below metaphor as specified
  - Professional subtitle and annotation styling with matched border colors
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical spacing between groups is generous, leaving some unused canvas space
    that could be tightened
  - Rain points implemented via zero-width Violin trace rather than a more idiomatic
    scatter approach
  - Point markers (size 9) cause some visual clumping in the dense Treatment A group
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with four experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) arranged on the y-axis
    and Reaction Time (ms) on the x-axis, ranging from approximately 150 to 660 ms.
    Each condition features three layered components: a semi-transparent half-violin
    (cloud) extending upward above the category baseline, a thin white box plot with
    dark outlines centered on the baseline showing median and quartiles, and jittered
    strip points (rain) scattered below the baseline. The color palette is a cohesive
    blue-teal scheme: dark blue (#306998) for Control, medium blue (#4B8BBE) for Treatment
    A, teal (#2A9D8F) for Treatment B, and purple (#7B68AE) for Treatment C. Three
    annotations with arrows highlight key distributional features: "Outliers" pointing
    to the Control group''s high-value points near 620-650 ms, "Tight cluster (low
    variance)" pointing to Treatment A''s concentrated distribution, and "Bimodal:
    two distinct response clusters" pointing to Treatment B''s double-peaked violin.
    The title reads "raincloud-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" in large text with a smaller
    subtitle "Distribution shape, summary stats, and individual observations in one
    view." A horizontal legend labeled "Condition" sits below the plot. The background
    is clean white with subtle vertical gridlines. Overall the layout is well-proportioned
    with generous margins and clear visual hierarchy.'
