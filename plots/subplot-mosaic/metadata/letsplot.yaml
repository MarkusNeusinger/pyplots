  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of ggbunch() for complex mosaic layouts with precise region
    control
  - Consistent visual theme with harmonious blue/yellow color palette across all 6
    panels
  - Diverse plot types (area, bar, scatter, histogram, line, heatmap) showcase versatility
  - Clear visual hierarchy with appropriately sized panels matching their data importance
  - Realistic business dashboard context with coherent related metrics
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Main title appears at top-left corner rather than centered prominently over entire
    figure
  - Does not demonstrate empty cell capability (using "." placeholder) mentioned in
    spec notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a complex 6-panel mosaic layout with varying
    subplot sizes. At the top, a full-width area chart shows "Daily Revenue Overview"
    with a blue line (#306998) and semi-transparent blue fill over 100 days. The middle
    row has a bar chart "Sales by Product" spanning 2/3 width showing 5 product categories
    in yellow bars with blue borders, and a scatter plot "Effort vs Output" in the
    remaining 1/3 with blue points and a yellow regression line. The bottom row contains
    three equal-width panels: a blue histogram "Score Distribution" showing a bimodal
    distribution, a yellow line chart "Monthly Growth" with blue points, and a heatmap
    "Regional Performance" using a yellow-to-blue gradient with white text values.
    The title "subplot-mosaic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.'

        comment: 'All text is readable; subplot titles are bold and clear, axis labels

          larger.'

        comment: No overlapping text; bar chart x-axis labels are angled at 45° to

        passed: true
        comment: All elements are clearly visible; scatter points, bars, histogram
          bins, and heatmap tiles are well-sized. The scatter points could be slightly
          larger for the data density.

          good contrast.

        comment: Good mosaic arrangement demonstrating the spec's purpose. The layout
          effectively shows varying sizes with clear visual hierarchy.

        comment: Effectively uses ggbunch() for mosaic layout with explicit regions,
          theme_minimal(), geom_smooth with method="lm", scale_fill_gradient for heatmap.
          Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics.
