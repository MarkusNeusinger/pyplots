review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical organization with group headers and indented tasks
  - Good use of geom_segment for both task bars and dependency lines
  - Clean color scheme with distinguishable phases
  - Proper datetime axis handling with scale_x_datetime
  - Thicker bars for group aggregates clearly distinguish phases from tasks
  weaknesses:
  - Dependency arrows lack arrowheads to show direction (finish-to-start)
  - Legend entries are alphabetically sorted rather than in logical project phase
    order
  - Some dependency lines cross over task bars instead of routing around them
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart showing a software development
    project timeline from January 2024 to mid-March 2024. The chart uses four distinct
    colors: dark blue (#306998) for Requirements phase, light blue (#4B8BBE) for Design
    phase, yellow (#FFD43B) for Development phase, and gray (#646464) for Testing
    phase. Tasks are organized hierarchically with group headers (marked with ▸) at
    the top of each phase, followed by indented individual tasks. Group aggregate
    bars are thicker than individual task bars. Gray dependency arrows connect related
    tasks, showing finish-to-start relationships. The y-axis displays task names with
    proper hierarchy (group headers and indented tasks), while the x-axis shows dates
    in 2024-MM-DD format rotated at 45 degrees. A legend on the right shows the Phase
    color mapping. The title "gantt-dependencies · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold.'
