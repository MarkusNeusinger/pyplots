review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including zero line, ±2σ threshold
    bands, and outlier highlighting
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with blue residuals and red/orange for outliers and
    thresholds
  - Realistic housing price prediction context with appropriate data scale
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of Highcharts features including plotLines, multiple series with different
    markers, and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible for better readability
