  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal's native Histogram chart type with the (count, start, end)
    tuple format — idiomatic and distinctive
  - Statistical storytelling elements (mean marker, IQR band) add analytical value
    beyond a basic frequency plot
  - Well-configured custom Style with explicit font sizes appropriate for 4800×2700
    canvas
  - Realistic exam score scenario with right-skewed distribution (normal + exponential)
    creates plausible data
  - Colorblind-safe three-color palette with good visual separation between series
  weaknesses:
  - The np.clip(base + skew, 0, 100) creates an artificial spike in the last bin at
    score 100 — consider using a distribution that naturally tapers or adjusting bin
    edges to avoid this artifact
  - 'Data storytelling is minimal: the mean and IQR are shown but there are no on-chart
    text annotations explaining insights (e.g., annotating the skew direction, or
    labeling the peak directly)'
  - The IQR band at 12% of max height is too subtle — it's easy to miss amid the main
    histogram bars
  - Layout has some imbalance with the clipped spike pulling the eye to the far right
  - Style code is verbose with the same font_family string repeated 7 times — could
    use a variable
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of exam scores for 500 students
    using pygal''s Histogram chart type. The main distribution bars are rendered in
    a semi-transparent Python Blue (#306998) across 25 bins spanning approximately
    40–100 points. The distribution is slightly right-skewed with peak frequencies
    around 40 students in the 65–75 range. A tall, narrow orange/brown bar marks the
    mean at 71.0 points, standing out clearly against the blue bars. A low green band
    along the bottom of the chart spans from approximately 63 to 78 points, representing
    the interquartile range (middle 50%). The background is white with a light gray
    (#fafafa) plot area. Horizontal dashed grid lines in light gray aid readability.
    The x-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)" and the y-axis "Number of Students"
    with values from 0 to approximately 41. The title "histogram-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend at the bottom identifies three series: "Score Distribution
    (n=500)" in blue, "Mean: 71.0 pts" in orange, and "IQR: 63–78 pts (middle 50%)"
    in green. There is a noticeable spike in the last bin at 100 due to np.clip ceiling
    effects.'
