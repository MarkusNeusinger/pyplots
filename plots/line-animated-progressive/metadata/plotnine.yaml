review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of animation spec for a static library using small multiples
    approach
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Effective use of yellow highlighting to indicate the current point in each stage
  - Good data generation with realistic seasonal patterns and growth trend
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines reduces ability to compare values across panels
  - Could benefit from a small legend explaining the yellow highlight meaning
  - X-axis tick labels are somewhat crowded despite rotation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples layout showing progressive
    line reveal of monthly sales data over time. Each panel represents a different
    stage of data accumulation: 6 Months, 12 Months, 18 Months, and 24 Months (Complete).
    The line is rendered in a dark blue color (#306998) with small circular markers
    at each data point. The current/latest point in each panel is highlighted with
    a larger yellow marker (#FFD43B). The x-axis shows time periods from Jan ''23
    to Dec ''24 (rotated 45°), and the y-axis shows Monthly Sales in USD formatted
    as $50K-$70K. The title follows the correct format: "line-animated-progressive
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Progressive Line Reveal: Monthly Sales
    Growth Over Time". The background is clean white with subtle gray facet headers.
    The data shows a seasonal pattern with an upward trend over the 2-year period.'
