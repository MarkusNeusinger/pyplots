review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts arearange series for confidence bands with proper
    layering (bands behind lines)
  - Colorblind-safe palette using blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Professional appearance with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic learning curve data showing typical ML training behavior (overfitting
    gap that decreases with more data)
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean separation of training and validation curves with distinct markers (squares
    vs triangles)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend does not include entries for the confidence bands (±1 std) - only shows
    the line series
  - Y-axis could start at 0.65 instead of 0.60 to reduce empty space at the bottom
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a learning curve visualization on a white background. The title "learning-curve-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle "Model Performance vs Training Set Size" below it. The X-axis shows "Training Set Size (samples)" ranging from 0 to 1700, and the Y-axis shows "Accuracy Score" ranging from 0.60 to 1.02. Two lines are displayed:
    - A **blue line with square markers** representing Training Score, starting high (~0.99) and gradually decreasing to ~0.94
    - A **yellow/gold line with triangle markers** representing Validation Score, starting low (~0.72) and increasing toward ~0.93
    Both lines have semi-transparent shaded confidence bands showing ±1 standard deviation. The blue band is narrower (training is more consistent), while the yellow band is wider at low training sizes and narrows as training size increases. A legend in the top-right corner clearly identifies both series. Dashed grid lines provide reference.
