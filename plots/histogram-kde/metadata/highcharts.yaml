review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of semi-transparent histogram bars allowing KDE overlay visibility
  - Correct density normalization for comparable histogram and KDE scales
  - Good implementation of Scott's rule for KDE bandwidth calculation
  - Professional colorblind-safe color scheme using Python blue and yellow
  - Clean bimodal data generation demonstrating the plot type's utility
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (alpha 0.2-0.3 instead of 0.1)
  - Could add hover tooltips to leverage Highcharts interactivity strengths
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram with KDE overlay showing simulated
    daily stock returns. The histogram bars are semi-transparent blue (#306998 with
    0.6 alpha) with darker blue borders. The KDE curve is rendered as a smooth yellow/golden
    area spline (#FFD43B) with light yellow fill underneath. The title "histogram-kde
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top with a subtitle
    "Simulated Daily Stock Returns (%)". The x-axis shows "Return (%)" ranging from
    approximately -9 to 10.5, and the y-axis shows "Density" from 0 to 0.17. The legend
    in the upper right identifies "Histogram" and "KDE" series. The distribution shows
    a slight left skew with the main peak around -1.5 to 0, and a secondary concentration
    around -3 reflecting the bimodal data generation.

          Slightly smaller than optimal for the canvas size.

        comment: 'Histogram bars and KDE curve are well-sized. The semi-transparent
          bars allow the KDE to show through nicely. Minor: some bars appear slightly
          thin relative to bin width.'

        comment: X-axis has "Return (%)" with units, Y-axis has "Density" without
          units (density is unitless, so acceptable).

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1), legend is well-placed. Grid could be
          slightly more visible.

        comment: Uses AreaSplineSeries for smooth KDE curve and ColumnSeries for histogram.
          Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like tooltips or hover
          effects.
