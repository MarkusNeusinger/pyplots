review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot for 2D kernel density estimation with both filled
    and line contours
  - Two-cluster data effectively demonstrates density visualization capabilities
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility and visual appeal
  - Scatter overlay adds context without cluttering the visualization
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No colorbar/legend to show the density scale mapping
  - Generic axis labels (X Variable, Y Variable) rather than a real-world scenario
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2D density contour visualization with filled
    contours using the viridis colormap (purple for low density transitioning through
    blue/green to yellow for high density). Two distinct cluster centers are clearly
    visible: a larger main cluster centered around (5, 4-5) and a smaller secondary
    cluster around (9-10, 7-8). White semi-transparent scatter points are overlaid
    on the contours to show the underlying data distribution. The title "contour-density
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Both axes have descriptive labels
    with units: "X Variable (units)" and "Y Variable (units)". A subtle dashed grid
    is present in the background. The plot fills the canvas well with good proportions.'
