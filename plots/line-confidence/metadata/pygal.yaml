review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic user growth prediction scenario with appropriate data scale
  - Good use of pygal XY chart and custom Style configuration
  - Proper axis labels and grid configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval band is nearly invisible - the filled polygon approach with
    rgba opacity renders as an almost imperceptible thin region rather than a clearly
    visible shaded band
  - Legend claims 95% Confidence Interval but users cannot actually see the band,
    making the visualization misleading
  - Pygal fill mechanism for polygons may not be suitable for confidence bands - library
    limitation for this visualization type
