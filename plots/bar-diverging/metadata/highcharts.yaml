review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent colorblind-safe color scheme (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Clear zero baseline with prominent plotLine
  - Data labels on each bar improve readability
  - Properly sorted data from highest positive to lowest negative
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of horizontal bar orientation for readable category labels
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis title lacks units (could be "Net Satisfaction Score (%)")
  - Bars could be slightly thicker (pointWidth) to better fill the vertical space
