review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's Whisker and TeeHead components for professional error
    bar caps
  - Clean implementation using ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Demonstrates asymmetric error bars as mentioned in the spec
  - Realistic experimental scenario with control and treatment groups
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good use of grid styling with dashed lines and appropriate alpha
  weaknesses:
  - Text sizes could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas (title 36pt is good,
    but axis labels at 28pt could be 32pt)
  - The Bokeh toolbar in the corner adds visual clutter to the static PNG output
  image_description: The plot displays an error bar chart with 6 experimental groups
    (Control, Treatment A, B, C, D, E) along the x-axis and "Response Value (units)"
    on the y-axis ranging from 0 to ~55. Each data point is represented by a blue
    circle with vertical error bars extending above and below. The error bars have
    visible caps (horizontal lines at the ends). Treatment D shows the highest mean
    value (~48), while Control has the lowest (~25). Treatment C notably shows asymmetric
    error bars with a larger lower uncertainty. The color scheme uses a consistent
    blue (#306998) throughout. The title "errorbar-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. A subtle dashed horizontal grid helps with readability. There is a
    Bokeh logo/toolbar visible in the top-right corner.
