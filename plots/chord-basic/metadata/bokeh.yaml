review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of chord diagram from scratch using Bokeh primitives
    (patches, bezier curves)
  - 'Perfect use of Bokeh-specific features: HoverTool with custom tooltips showing
    flow details, interactive toolbar'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with Python-themed colors
  - Well-positioned legend that does not obstruct the visualization
  - Clean arc segments with proportional sizing based on total flows
  - Smooth bezier curves for chords with appropriate transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Contains helper function bezier_chord() which violates KISS structure
  - Bidirectional flows are combined rather than shown as separate chords (spec mentions
    both directions should be visible separately)
