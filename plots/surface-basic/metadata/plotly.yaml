review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and depth perception
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper sizing (4800x2700 via
    scale=3)
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labeling
  - Smooth 40x40 grid provides good surface detail without jagged edges
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated, showcasing Plotly dual-format capability
  - Well-configured camera angle showing the surface from an informative perspective
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis) rather than contextual
  - Layout has more whitespace than optimal; surface could fill more of the canvas
  - np.random.seed(42) is included but unnecessary since the data generation is deterministic
