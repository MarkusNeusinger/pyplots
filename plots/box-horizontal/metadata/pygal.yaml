review:
  strengths:
  - Good color palette using PyPlots brand colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic data scenario with service response times including meaningful outliers
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Uses Tukey box mode for proper whisker calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Boxes are overlapping/stacking at the top of the chart instead of being separated
    into distinct rows per category - the y-axis should show each service type as
    a separate row
  - Missing category labels on the y-axis (only Service Type as axis title, not the
    individual category names)
  - Custom class definition violates the KISS principle (no functions/classes rule)
  - Imports internal pygal modules which is fragile and may break with library updates
  - Excessive whitespace between the chart and the legend at the bottom
