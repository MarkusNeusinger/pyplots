review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual separation of the three Iris species clusters demonstrating PCA's
    ability to reduce dimensionality
  - Loading vectors are well-scaled and clearly labeled with smart offset positioning
    to avoid overlap
  - Proper variance explained percentages in axis labels (73.0% + 22.9% = 95.9% captured)
  - Good use of reference lines at origin to help interpret loading directions
  - Clean, publication-ready aesthetic with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Missing unit circle reference mentioned in spec (though marked as consider, adding
    it would enhance interpretation)
  - Legend capitalizes species names while loading labels use different styling -
    minor inconsistency
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot using the classic Iris dataset.
    Three distinct clusters of observation points are shown: Setosa (blue, #306998)
    in the left region with negative PC1 values, Versicolor (yellow, #FFD43B) in the
    center, and Virginica (red/coral, #E74C3C) on the right with positive PC1 values.
    Four loading vectors (dark blue arrows) emanate from the origin, labeled with
    the original feature names: Sepal Width points upward (positive PC2), while Sepal
    Length, Petal Length, and Petal Width all point toward the right with slight variations
    in angle. The x-axis shows PC1 (73.0%) and y-axis shows PC2 (22.9%), indicating
    these two components capture 95.9% of the total variance. The title uses the correct
    format "biplot-pca · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Dashed gray reference lines cross
    at the origin, and a subtle grid is visible. The legend is positioned in the upper
    right corner with good contrast.'
