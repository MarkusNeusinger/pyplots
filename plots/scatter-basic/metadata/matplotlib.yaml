review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent educational context (study hours vs exam scores) that is immediately
    relatable
  - Perfect title format following the required convention
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.7) and white edgecolors to distinguish overlapping
    points
  - Clean KISS code structure without unnecessary complexity
  - Appropriate marker size for data density
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha=0.3, dashed) aids readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage distinctive matplotlib features (e.g., annotations, colorbar,
    secondary elements)
  - Marker size s=180 slightly exceeds guidelines for this data density
