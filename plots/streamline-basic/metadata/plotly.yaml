review:
  strengths:
  - Clean spiral pattern effectively demonstrates vector field flow with clear directional
    arrows
  - Correct use of Plotly figure_factory.create_streamline for streamline generation
  - Proper title format and readable text sizes
  - Good grid styling with subtle alpha and emphasized zero lines
  - Equal aspect ratio maintained with scaleanchor
  weaknesses:
  - 'Colorbar is misleading: displays velocity magnitude scale but streamlines are
    uniform color, not color-coded by velocity'
  - Asymmetric axis ranges (-6 to 6 on x vs -3 to 3 on y) despite data spanning -3
    to 3 in both dimensions
  - np.random.seed(42) is set but no random data is actually used - unnecessary import
    of randomness
