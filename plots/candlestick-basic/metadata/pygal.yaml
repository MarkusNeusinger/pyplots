review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of candlesticks using XY chart with varying stroke widths
    for bodies vs wicks
  - Proper color coding with appropriate green/red palette for bullish/bearish candles
  - Well-sized fonts and elements for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of pygal Style class for consistent theming
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with proper price continuity
  - Legend correctly identifies only one entry per category
  weaknesses:
  - Wicks could be slightly thicker for better visibility at smaller display sizes
  - Bottom legend creates extra whitespace below the chart
