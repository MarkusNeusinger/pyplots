review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to implement candlesticks using XY chart with different stroke
    widths for wicks and bodies
  - Clean, readable code with good structure and comments
  - Proper color coding for bullish/bearish with accessible green/red scheme
  - Realistic financial data generation with proper OHLC relationships
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Candlestick wicks appear quite thin relative to the large canvas, making high/low
    ranges less prominent
  - The approach creates 60 separate series (2 per candle), which may affect rendering
    performance and tooltip behavior
  - Font sizes in the custom style are larger than the library defaults but tick labels
    still appear somewhat small on the 4800x2700 canvas
