review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex meteorological diagram with all required
    reference lines (isotherms, dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing ratio)
  - Proper Skew-T transformation applied to temperature data
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features including interactive tools and HTML export
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with appropriate temperature and dewpoint
    profiles
  - Clear color coding to distinguish different line types
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions (skew_x, calc_dry_adiabat, calc_moist_adiabat) violate KISS structure
    - should be inline calculations
  - Annotation labels for reference lines are too small and faint to be easily readable
  - Legend text appears small in rendered output
  image_description: The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram with pressure
    on the Y-axis (logarithmic scale, inverted from 1000 hPa at bottom to 100 hPa
    at top) and temperature in skewed coordinates on the X-axis (ranging from -40°C
    to 40°C). The main data profiles show a red solid temperature line with circular
    markers and a teal/cyan dashed dewpoint line with diamond markers, both depicting
    a typical mid-latitude atmospheric sounding. The diagram includes gray skewed
    isotherms, tan/orange dashed dry adiabats, light blue dot-dashed moist adiabats,
    and green dotted mixing ratio lines. A highlighted blue 0°C isotherm is visible.
    Labels for "Dry Adiabats", "Moist Adiabats", and "Mixing Ratio" are positioned
    on the chart. The legend in the top-left shows Temperature, Dewpoint, and 0°C
    Isotherm entries. The background is a light gray (#f8f9fa). The title correctly
    displays "skewt-logp-atmospheric · bokeh · pyplots.ai".
