review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of seaborn stripplot with jitter for SHAP value distribution visualization
  - Correct coolwarm diverging colormap from blue (low) to red (high) feature values
  - Features properly sorted by importance with most important at top
  - Clean vertical reference line at x=0 clearly separates positive and negative impacts
  - Well-placed colorbar with clear labeling for feature value interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Consider using slightly larger marker size (s=10-12) for better visibility of
    individual points
  image_description: 'The plot displays a SHAP summary visualization with 12 breast
    cancer features sorted vertically by importance (most important at top). Each
    row represents a feature with dots representing individual samples. The horizontal
    axis shows SHAP values ranging from approximately -0.75 to 1.0, with a clear blue
    vertical reference line at x=0. Points are colored using a coolwarm diverging
    colormap: blue indicates low feature values (0.0) and red indicates high feature
    values (1.0). The colorbar on the right clearly labels "Feature Value (Low to
    High)". Features like "mean area" and "mean concave points" show wide SHAP value
    distributions, while "mean compactness" shows a narrow distribution. The title
    reads "shap-summary · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. The layout is clean with
    subtle gridlines on the x-axis.'

        comment: Good use of sns.stripplot with hue mapping and palette, sns.despine
          for styling, but could leverage more seaborn features
  verdict: APPROVED
