review:
  strengths:
  - All four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot) are clearly visible
    and easily distinguishable
  - Added markers provide additional visual differentiation beyond line styles alone
  - Consistent line width across all series maintains visual harmony
  - Legend clearly maps styles to series names as required by the specification
  - The plot is well-suited for black-and-white printing - the different line styles
    would remain distinguishable without color
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., Performance Score (pts) or Relative Performance)
  - 'Blue color palette has two similar shades (#306998 and #4B8BBE) - while line
    styles make them distinguishable, more contrasting colors would improve color
    accessibility further'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a styled line chart showing CPU performance
    benchmark scores over 12 months (January to December). Four processor series are
    shown, each with a distinct line style: Processor A uses a solid dark blue line
    with circle markers, Processor B uses a dashed yellow/gold line with square markers,
    Processor C uses a dotted light blue line with triangle markers, and Processor
    D uses a dash-dot gray line with diamond markers. The title "line-styled · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in the upper left corner clearly maps
    each line style to its series name. The Y-axis shows "Performance Score" ranging
    from approximately 80 to 135, and the X-axis shows "Month" with abbreviated month
    names. A subtle dashed grid aids readability.'
