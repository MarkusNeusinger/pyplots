review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent physics example with analytically correct damped harmonic oscillator
    solution
  - Multiple trajectories clearly demonstrate basin of attraction structure
  - Direction arrows effectively show time evolution without cluttering the plot
  - Color scheme provides excellent contrast and is colorblind-accessible
  - Title format correctly follows spec requirements
  - Hover templates provide useful interactivity showing exact x and dx/dt values
  - Fixed point and initial conditions clearly marked with distinct symbols
  - Clean, well-organized code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size on trajectory lines (size=4) could be slightly larger for better visibility
    at full resolution
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is very subtle; 0.2-0.3 would provide better reference without
    being distracting
  - Axis labels lack units (though dimensionless is acceptable for theoretical phase
    diagrams)
  - Does not fully leverage Plotly animation features that could show trajectory evolution
    over time
