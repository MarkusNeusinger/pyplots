review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wind barbs using plotnine grammar of graphics (layer
    composition with geom_segment, geom_point, geom_polygon)
  - 'Proper meteorological notation: correct pennant triangles for 50 knots, full/half
    barbs, and calm circles'
  - Good feature coverage showing the full range of wind barb notation
  - Clean, readable code with proper data organization
  - Informative legend explaining all barb notation
  - Appropriate use of the plotnine theme system
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper-left is close to some data points; could be positioned
    outside plot area
  - Realistic context could be stronger (generic grid vs named weather stations)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a wind barb visualization on a coordinate grid with Longitude (°E) on the x-axis (0-12) and Latitude (°N) on the y-axis (0.0-7.5+). Wind barbs are rendered in blue (#306998) showing wind direction and speed using standard meteorological notation. The plot includes:
    - Staff lines pointing in the direction from which wind blows, with blue dots at station positions
    - Half barbs (short diagonal lines) representing 5 knots
    - Full barbs (longer diagonal lines) representing 10 knots
    - Triangular pennants (filled triangles) representing 50 knots - visible on several high-wind barbs
    - Open circles representing calm conditions (< 2.5 knots) - visible at positions like (2,0), (10,0), and (10,4)
    - A legend box in the upper-left showing the wind barb key with all notation types
    - The title "windbarb-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" at the top
    - Clean minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines

          layers, annotate for legend, and theme customization. Uses plotnine natively
