review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color palette using established accessible colors
  - Good use of x_labels_major to avoid label crowding on time series
  - Custom tooltips with date and value for interactivity (visible in HTML output)
  - Reference line at 100 implemented with dashed style using stroke_dasharray
  - Appropriate Y-axis range set with range=(70, 180) to show all data clearly
  weaknesses:
  - Reference line appears as a legend entry with Reference (100) label rather than
    being a subtle annotation; this clutters the legend
  - SPY (market benchmark) outperforming all individual stocks is counterintuitive
    for a stock comparison demonstration
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a multi-line stock price comparison chart with 5 series. The chart has a white background with the title "line-stock-comparison · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Rebased Price (Start = 100)" ranging from 70 to 180. The X-axis shows dates from Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 with monthly labels rotated at 45 degrees. Five stock series are displayed:
    - AAPL (blue): Shows moderate performance ending around 115
    - GOOGL (orange/yellow): Strong performer, peaks around 175 in October/November
    - MSFT (pink): Underperformer, declines to around 80-85
    - SPY (Benchmark) (green/teal): Best performer, reaches 160-170 range
    - Reference (100) (gray): Horizontal dashed line at 100 showing the starting point

    The legend is positioned at the bottom with 5 columns. The chart uses colorblind-friendly colors and has horizontal grid lines for readability. Lines have small dots at data points.
