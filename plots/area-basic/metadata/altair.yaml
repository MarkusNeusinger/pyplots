review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent weekly pattern simulation showing realistic website traffic with weekday
    peaks and weekend dips
  - Clean declarative Altair code following the library's grammar of graphics philosophy
  - Good use of opacity (0.4) and line styling to create visual depth
  - Proper use of temporal encoding (:T) for dates
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Daily Visitors (count))
  - Could add tooltip showing exact values for interactive version carried to static
    aesthetics
