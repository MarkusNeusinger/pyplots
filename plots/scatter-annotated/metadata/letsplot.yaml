quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable visualization with all 15 company labels clearly visible
  - Good use of geom_text with nudge_y for label positioning
  - Appropriate point size and alpha for data density
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful outliers (startup high-growth, mature
    low-growth)
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Some label pairs are close together (ByteWorks/SmartScale, DataSys/LogiCore/CloudNet
    region) - could benefit from adjustText-like positioning if available in lets-plot
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart showing 15 company names plotted
    by Annual Revenue (x-axis, in $ millions, ranging from ~60 to ~540) against Year-over-Year
    Growth (y-axis, in %, ranging from 0 to 55). Each data point is a blue (#306998)
    circle with alpha=0.7, and company names appear as dark gray text labels positioned
    above each point. The title "scatter-annotated · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. Notable outliers include QuantumAI (low revenue, high growth ~48%),
    NeuraTech (high revenue ~480M, high growth ~42%), and MegaSoft (highest revenue
    ~520M, low growth ~8%). The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines.
