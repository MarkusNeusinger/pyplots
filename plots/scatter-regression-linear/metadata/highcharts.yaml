review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper font scaling for 4800x2700 resolution
  - 'All spec requirements met: scatter points, regression line, 95% CI band, R² value,
    and regression equation displayed'
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette using blue for data points and yellow for
    regression line
  - Good use of alpha transparency on data points (0.7) for appropriate density visualization
  - Proper statistical calculations including regression coefficients and confidence
    intervals
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible advertising/sales data
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-right corner with some wasted space; could be integrated
    more tightly with the plot area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with linear regression showing
    the relationship between Advertising Spend ($K) on the x-axis (ranging from 10-98)
    and Sales Revenue ($K) on the y-axis (ranging from 10-280). Blue circular data
    points (80 points with ~0.7 alpha) are scattered around a bright yellow regression
    line. A light gray/blue semi-transparent 95% confidence interval band surrounds
    the regression line. The title "scatter-regression-linear · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top in bold. Below it, a subtitle shows the regression
    equation "y = 2.54x + 12.85 | R² = 0.988". A legend in the top-right corner identifies
    the three series: 95% Confidence Interval, Regression Line, and Data Points. The
    grid lines are subtle (light gray), and the overall layout is clean with good
    use of the canvas space.'
