review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear, distinguishable faces for each species
  - Comprehensive legends explaining both species colors and feature mappings
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Proper data normalization as specified
  - Uses real Iris dataset for meaningful visualization
  - Good grid layout with balanced spacing and canvas utilization
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper function create_face_svg() instead of flat KISS structure
  - Not technically using Highcharts library - implements pure SVG instead (understandable
    since Highcharts lacks native Chernoff face support)
