review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with realistic service response time scenario showing varied
    distributions and outliers
  - Services sorted by median response time as recommended in the spec for easier
    comparison
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotnine grammar of graphics idiom
  - Good visual hierarchy with appropriately sized text elements
  - Python-themed color palette adds personality while remaining readable
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor code issue: panel_grid_major_y uses element_text() instead of element_line()
    which is incorrect'
  - Y-axis label is empty string instead of descriptive label like Service Type
  - Could use more distinctive plotnine features like faceting or statistical transformations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response times
    (ms) for 5 service types. Services are arranged vertically on the y-axis (sorted
    by median): Database Query Handler (bottom, blue), Authentication Service (yellow),
    Email Notification (light blue), Payment Gateway (gray), and File Storage API
    (top, light yellow). The x-axis shows Response Time (ms) ranging from 0 to 400.
    Each box shows the IQR with median line, whiskers extend to 1.5*IQR, and outliers
    are visible as dots for Database Query Handler (around 220-280ms) and Payment
    Gateway (around 350-380ms). The title "box-horizontal · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed in bold at the top. The background uses a minimal theme with subtle
    grid lines.'
