review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including confidence band, rug
    plot, and zero-centering
  - Uses real ML workflow with sklearn partial_dependence function and GradientBoostingRegressor
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper reproducibility (random seeds)
  - Good use of Bokeh Band model for the confidence interval visualization
  - Appropriate text scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom-right could be improved; top_right or top_left would
    be safer
  - Axis labels lack units (though partial dependence is unitless, could add context
    like standardized units)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot with a blue line
    showing the average partial dependence (centered at zero) across Feature X₀ values
    ranging from 0 to 1. A light blue shaded band represents the 80% confidence interval
    around the main line. The curve shows a characteristic sigmoid-like pattern: starting
    low around -4 to -8 at low feature values, rising steeply through the middle range,
    and plateauing around +1.5 at higher values. A yellow rug plot at the bottom shows
    the distribution of training data points. The title "pdp-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. A dashed horizontal reference line at y=0 helps interpret
    relative effects. The legend in the bottom right shows "80% CI", "Average PD",
    and "Data Distribution". The background is a light gray (#fafafa) with dashed
    grid lines.'
