review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario using website traffic by hour which perfectly demonstrates
    cyclical nature of polar charts
  - Beautiful visual design with viridis colormap providing both aesthetic appeal
    and colorblind accessibility
  - Proper polar configuration with theta offset at top (12 o'clock) and clockwise
    direction for time-based data
  - Smart combination of scatter points, connecting line, and filled area to create
    rich visualization
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=300) and alpha (0.8) for 24 data points
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is primarily used for styling (set_theme, set_context, color_palette)
    rather than its distinctive plotting functions - this is acceptable since seaborn
    lacks native polar plot support
  - The Visitors y-axis label position on the right side is unconventional for polar
    plots
  - Grid style uses dashed lines which could be simplified to solid with lower alpha
