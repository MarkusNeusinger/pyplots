review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent ternary plot implementation with proper coordinate transformation from
    ternary to Cartesian
  - Clean grid lines at 20% intervals with subtle dashed styling (alpha 0.3)
  - Clear vertex labels with component names and percentages
  - Good use of tooltips for interactive data exploration
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic soil composition scenario with appropriate data context
  - Well-implemented tick marks along all three edges
  weaknesses:
  - Tick labels on left and right edges could be slightly larger for better readability
    at smaller display sizes
  image_description: The plot displays an equilateral triangle representing a ternary
    diagram for soil composition. The triangle has three vertices labeled "Sand (100%)",
    "Silt (100%)", and "Clay (100%)" in bold dark text. Inside the triangle, 50 blue
    circular data points (#306998 color) are scattered showing different soil sample
    compositions. Dashed gray grid lines run parallel to each edge at 20%, 40%, 60%,
    and 80% intervals, creating a readable reference grid. Tick marks with numerical
    labels (20, 40, 60, 80) appear along each edge. The title "Soil Composition ·
    ternary-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clean sans-serif
    font. The overall layout is clean with good use of whitespace and the triangle
    is well-centered on the canvas.
