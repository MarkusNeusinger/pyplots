review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color contrast with dark green and dark red that works well for colorblind
    users
  - Clear comparison between well-calibrated and overconfident models demonstrates
    calibration concepts effectively
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Interactive tooltips with informative labels showing calibration details
  - Properly scaled font sizes for readability at high resolution
  - Brier scores displayed in legend provide quantitative calibration metrics
  weaknesses:
  - Legend indicators are small colored squares rather than line+marker symbols, making
    series identification slightly harder
  - Grid/guides could be more subtle (currently slightly prominent)
  - The perfect calibration line extends fully to corners while model curves do not
    reach (0,0) or (1,1), creating visual imbalance
