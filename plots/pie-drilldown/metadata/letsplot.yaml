review:
  strengths:
  - Clean donut chart design with clear percentage labels inside slices
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Comprehensive HTML implementation with full drilldown functionality, breadcrumb
    navigation, and cursor changes on hover
  - Realistic company budget data with sensible hierarchical structure (4 departments,
    3-4 subcategories each)
  - Legend includes both category names and dollar values for context
  weaknesses:
  - Static PNG only shows root level without any indication that drilldown is available
    (no visual cues that slices are clickable)
  - Legend could include a visual indicator or note about drilldown functionality
  - Layout has significant whitespace on the right side between chart and legend
  - HTML drilldown uses custom Canvas/JavaScript rather than leveraging lets-plot
    native interactive capabilities
