review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all RSI-specific features: threshold lines at 30/70,
    centerline at 50, and zone shading for overbought/oversold regions'
  - Strong visual clarity with proper color coding (orange for overbought, blue for
    oversold) that matches typical financial charting conventions
  - Correct title format and comprehensive subtitle with methodology details
  - Well-structured synthetic data that demonstrates realistic RSI momentum behavior
    including overbought entries, deep oversold conditions, and recovery patterns
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Zone labels (Overbought Zone, Oversold Zone) are positioned at the far right edge
    of the chart which creates slight visual imbalance
  image_description: 'The chart displays an RSI Technical Indicator with a dark blue
    line plotting RSI values from January through late April 2024. The Y-axis spans
    0-100 with tick marks at intervals of 10. The X-axis shows dates with 2-week intervals
    (Jan 8, Jan 22, Feb 5, etc.). Three horizontal reference lines are clearly visible:
    an orange dashed line at 70 labeled "Overbought (70)", a blue dashed line at 30
    labeled "Oversold (30)", and a gray dotted line at 50 labeled "Centerline (50)".
    The overbought zone (70-100) is shaded in light orange with "Overbought Zone"
    label, and the oversold zone (0-30) is shaded in light blue with "Oversold Zone"
    label. The RSI line shows clear momentum patterns: it enters overbought territory
    (above 70) around early February reaching ~93, then drops sharply through the
    oversold zone to near 3 around early March, before recovering. A second overbought
    entry occurs around early April (~85). The title "indicator-rsi · highcharts ·
    pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed with subtitle showing "Relative Strength
    Index (14-period) · Synthetic Stock Data". Legend at bottom shows "RSI (14)".'
