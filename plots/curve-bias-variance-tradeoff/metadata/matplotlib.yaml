review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements (4 curves, optimal point, zones,
    formula)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with appropriate line weights and colors
  - Well-positioned annotations that do not obstruct data
  - Good use of shaded regions to indicate underfitting/overfitting zones
  - Formula annotation in a clean box format
  weaknesses:
  - Variance direct label color (#B8860B dark goldenrod) differs from actual variance
    line color (#FFD43B bright yellow)
  - Legend at top duplicates the direct curve labels on the plot, creating some redundancy
  image_description: The plot displays the classic bias-variance tradeoff visualization
    with four distinct curves on a 16:9 canvas. The Bias² curve (blue solid line)
    starts high around 3.6 at low complexity and decreases asymptotically towards
    0. The Variance curve (golden/yellow solid line) starts at 0 and increases linearly
    with complexity, reaching about 3 at high complexity. The Irreducible Error (gray
    dashed horizontal line) is constant at 0.5. The Total Error curve (red solid line,
    thicker) shows the characteristic U-shape, starting high (~4.2), decreasing to
    a minimum around complexity 3.3, then increasing. A green dotted vertical line
    marks the optimal complexity point with a green dot annotation reading "Optimal
    Complexity". The left region is shaded light blue with "Underfitting (High Bias)"
    label, and the right region is shaded light yellow with "Overfitting (High Variance)"
    label. X-axis shows "Low", "Medium", "High" labels for Model Complexity. The formula
    "Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error" appears in a box at bottom
    right. Legend is positioned at top center with all four curves labeled. Direct
    curve labels appear near each line on the right side.
