review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements all three raincloud components (half-violin cloud, jittered
    rain points, boxplot) using pygal XY chart
  - Follows spec vertical orientation guidance with cloud on right, rain on left
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/green)
  - Good data context with realistic reaction time scenario and meaningful outliers
  - Proper seed setting for reproducibility
  - Successfully renders both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Boxplot elements are visually too thin and hard to distinguish from background
  - No grid lines make it harder to read exact values
  - Scatter points (rain) could be larger for better visibility at this canvas size
  - Font sizes could be scaled up further for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Legend shows redundant category entries
