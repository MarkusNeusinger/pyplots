review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Iris dataset with clear species separation visible across
    all pairwise comparisons
  - Well-organized matrix layout with labels only on edges to reduce clutter
  - Appropriate note about matplotlib static limitation with guidance toward interactive
    alternatives
  - Good color palette that is both aesthetically pleasing and colorblind-accessible
  - Histograms on diagonal effectively show univariate distributions by species
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes slightly undersized for the target resolution (labels at 14pt instead
    of 20pt recommended)
  - No explicit random seed in code (though data is deterministic from sklearn)
  - Legend and title slightly crowded at top of figure
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) of the Iris
    dataset with all four numeric variables: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length,
    and Petal Width (all in cm). The three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
    are color-coded using blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), and coral/red (#E55B3C)
    respectively. Diagonal cells show overlapping histograms for each species, while
    off-diagonal cells display scatter plots comparing variable pairs. The legend
    is positioned at the top, just below the title. Axis labels are placed on the
    left and bottom edges only, reducing clutter. A note at the bottom explains matplotlib''s
    static output limitation, directing users to interactive libraries for linked
    brushing. The overall layout is well-balanced with subtle grid lines.'

        comment: Uses subplots grid effectively, histogram with species separation.
          Could use more advanced features like tight subplot spacing or shared axes
          configuration
