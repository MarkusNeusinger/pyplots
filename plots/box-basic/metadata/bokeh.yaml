review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: factor_cmap, Whisker model, LabelSet,
    and ColumnDataSource pattern'
  - Data storytelling annotations highlighting tightest and widest spread with IQR
    values
  - Clean visual design with subtle grid, removed spines/ticks, and transparent background
  - Comprehensive data variety across the four classes (different medians, spreads,
    outlier patterns)
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh web-native capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'The two blue shades (Class A #306998 and Class B #4B8BBE) are somewhat close
    and may be difficult to distinguish for some color vision deficiencies'
  - Some vertical whitespace above the data could be reduced for tighter canvas utilization
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally
    on a white background representing test score distributions for Class A (dark
    blue, #306998), Class B (light blue, #4B8BBE), Class C (orange/gold, #E5A03A),
    and Class D (olive green, #7A9E3D). The title "box-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears in the top-left. The Y-axis is labeled "Test Score (points)" ranging from
    ~40 to ~120, and the X-axis is labeled "Class" with the four category names. Each
    box shows the interquartile range with a dark median line. Whiskers extend to
    1.5×IQR with horizontal caps. Outliers are displayed as hollow circles with dark
    borders. Two text annotations provide data insights: "Tightest spread (IQR = 7.0)"
    in blue above Class B and "Widest spread (IQR = 19.3)" in gold/brown above Class
    C. The grid consists of subtle dashed horizontal lines. The overall layout is
    clean with no axis spines on top/right and no tick marks.'
