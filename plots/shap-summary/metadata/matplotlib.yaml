review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the SHAP summary plot concept with proper sorting
    by feature importance
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of jittering to reduce point overlap within feature rows
  - Appropriate colormap (blue-gray-red) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic house price prediction context makes the visualization immediately understandable
  - Correct title format following project standards
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label lacks units (SHAP values are unitless but could clarify they represent
    log-odds or similar for clarity)
  - Marker size (s=80) is slightly on the smaller side for the data density; s=100-120
    would improve visibility
  - Could show more diverse SHAP patterns (e.g., features where both high and low
    values push predictions the same direction)
