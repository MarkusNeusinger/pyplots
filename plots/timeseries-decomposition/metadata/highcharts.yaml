review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each component (blue,
    yellow, purple, teal)
  - Clear vertical stacking of all four decomposition components with shared time
    axis
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for accurate decomposition
  - Good handling of NaN values in trend and residual components
  - Well-formatted datetime axis labels (YYYY-MM format)
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic airline passenger dataset with appropriate 10-year monthly span
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function (create_chart_config) which slightly violates the
    KISS principle for plot implementations
  - Individual subplot heights appear somewhat compressed - could benefit from slightly
    taller subplots
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
