review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of letsplot ggplot2 grammar with multiple well-composed layers (area,
    line, smooth, point, text)
  - LOESS trend line with dashed styling adds analytical depth beyond a basic area
    chart
  - Peak annotation at 7,319 visitors provides clear data storytelling and visual
    focal point
  - Interactive tooltips via layer_tooltips() showcase letsplot distinctive interactivity
    features
  - Realistic website traffic data with believable weekly cyclical patterns and upward
    trend
  - All font sizes explicitly set for proper readability at 4800x2700 output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starting at 0 wastes significant vertical canvas space — data lives between
    ~4300-7600 but the bottom half of the plot is empty, reducing visual impact of
    area fill
  - Vertical gridlines could be removed for a cleaner more refined look
  - Only one data point is annotated — additional context like marking the lowest
    dip or adding a subtitle describing growth rate would strengthen storytelling
  - Area fill at alpha 0.35 could be slightly more prominent to better emphasize the
    volume aspect that area charts communicate
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 data points). The filled area uses a semi-transparent Python
    Blue (#306998) at alpha 0.35, with a solid blue line (width 1.8) tracing the top
    edge. A dark navy dashed LOESS trend line runs through the data, clearly showing
    an upward trajectory over the month. A highlighted data point at January 23 is
    marked with an open white circle (shape 21, stroke 2.5) and annotated with "7,319
    visitors" in dark navy text above. The Y-axis runs from 0 to ~8,000 labeled "Daily
    Visitors", and the X-axis shows dates from Jan 01 to Jan 31 labeled "Date". The
    title reads "area-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in the upper left. The background
    is clean white with light gray (#E0E0E0) horizontal major gridlines and no minor
    gridlines, using a minimal theme. The data shows clear weekly cyclical patterns
    (dips every ~7 days) superimposed on a steady upward trend.
