review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of combining violin and box plots with clear visual hierarchy
  - 'Outstanding data variety: four groups showcasing symmetric, bimodal, skewed,
    and outlier-heavy distributions'
  - Python-themed color scheme (blue violins, yellow boxes) is visually appealing
    and colorblind-safe
  - Perfect text sizing following matplotlib guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Clean code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a simple legend to explain what the colors represent (violin = density,
    box = summary statistics)
  - Could use matplotlib's more advanced violin customization options like showing
    quantiles directly in the violin
