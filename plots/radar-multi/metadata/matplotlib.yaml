review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data design showing three distinct product profiles with clear trade-offs
    (Product A: Camera/Display leader, Product B: Battery/Build Quality leader, Product
    C: Performance/Value leader)'
  - Perfect polygon closure by appending first value to close the shape
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha 0.25) allows seeing overlapping areas while maintaining
    series visibility
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme using Python blue, yellow, and pink
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with clear comments
  weaknesses:
  - No distinctive matplotlib features used (could leverage custom styling, annotations,
    or advanced polar customization)
  - Radial tick labels (14pt gray) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  image_description: 'The radar chart displays a multi-series comparison of three
    products (A, B, C) across six attributes: Performance, Battery Life, Camera, Display,
    Build Quality, and Value. Product A is shown in blue (#306998), Product B in yellow
    (#FFD43B), and Product C in pink (#E377C2). Each product forms a filled polygon
    with 25% transparency, allowing overlap visibility. The chart has concentric circular
    gridlines at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 intervals. Category labels are positioned
    at the outer edge of each axis in bold black text. A legend is placed in the upper
    right. The title follows the required format at the top.'
