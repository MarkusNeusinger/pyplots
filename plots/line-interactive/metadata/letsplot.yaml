review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic server response patterns including daily/weekly
    cycles and anomaly spikes
  - Proper tooltip configuration using layer_tooltips for interactive hover information
  - Good color scheme with blue line and contrasting yellow points for accessibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Clean KISS code structure with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility could be reduced with explicit alpha setting (e.g., panel_grid
    alpha 0.3)
  - Output path uses script_dir which may cause issues - should save to current working
    directory as plot.png
  - Points (size=2) are slightly small for 350 data points - could be size=3 for better
    visibility in static PNG
