review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including the optional CML
  - Clear visual hierarchy with zorder properly managing layer order
  - Colorbar effectively shows Sharpe ratio variation across portfolios
  - Well-chosen marker sizes and alpha values for the data density
  - Clean, readable code structure with logical flow
  weaknesses:
  - Legend with 5 items is somewhat large; could be more compact or use annotations
    instead for some elements
  - The efficient frontier curve could be smoother - it has slight jaggedness due
    to the binning approach
  - Lower Sharpe ratio portfolios (< 0.5) are not well represented in the sample
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. The X-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation, %)" ranging from 0 to
    approximately 22%, and the Y-axis shows "Expected Return (%)" ranging from 0 to
    about 14.5%. Approximately 300 random portfolio points are scattered in the plot,
    colored by Sharpe ratio using the viridis colormap (purple/blue for lower values
    ~0.52 to yellow for higher values ~0.70). The efficient frontier is depicted as
    a thick dark blue curve (#306998) running along the upper boundary of the portfolio
    cloud. A yellow diamond marker indicates the Minimum Variance Portfolio at approximately
    (9.5%, 9.5%), and a red star marker indicates the Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
    at approximately (10.5%, 10.4%). A dashed gray Capital Market Line extends from
    the Risk-Free Rate point (gray circle at 0%, 3%) tangent to the frontier. A colorbar
    on the right displays the Sharpe Ratio scale. The title follows the required format:
    "frontier-efficient · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left clearly
    identifies all elements.'
