review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stem plot implementation with proper use of ax.stem() and customization
    via plt.setp()
  - Realistic signal processing data (damped oscillation) that aligns perfectly with
    spec applications
  - Clean white marker edges provide excellent visual distinction at stem endpoints
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  - Perfect title format and readable text at all sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Sample Index (n)" or "Amplitude (V)" would score
    higher)
  image_description: The plot displays a stem plot with 30 data points showing a damped
    oscillation signal. Blue (#306998) vertical stems extend from a black baseline
    at y=0 to circular markers with white edges at each data point. The x-axis is
    labeled "Sample Index" (0-30) and the y-axis "Amplitude" (-0.75 to 1.0). The title
    correctly follows the format "stem-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A subtle
    dashed grid (alpha=0.3) provides reference without distraction. The signal demonstrates
    clear damping behavior, starting at amplitude ~1.0 and decaying over time with
    oscillating positive and negative values.
