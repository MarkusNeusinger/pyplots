review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of multi-stage energy flows from sources through electricity
    to end uses
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with distinct, distinguishable colors for each node
    category
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic energy flow data with appropriate TWh values representing U.S. energy
    distribution
  - Good use of link opacity (0.5) to handle crossing flows
  - Subtitle provides context with units (TWh)
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels use white text with dark outline which works on dark nodes but may
    be hard to read on lighter nodes like Natural Gas (goldenrod)
  - Some node labels on left and right edges appear slightly cut off or positioned
    at edges of visible area
  - Interactive HTML version uses percentage width which differs from PNG fixed dimensions
