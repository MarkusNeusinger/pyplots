review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 4 distinct plot types in a cohesive 2x2 grid demonstrating
    Altair's concatenation capabilities
  - Thoughtful conditional coloring on bar chart (blue for high performers, yellow
    for lower) adds analytical value
  - Clean, consistent color scheme using Python's signature blue/yellow
  - Proper use of Altair's encoding types (Q, T, N) and scale customization
  - Good data context with a coherent financial dashboard theme
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend styling could be enhanced—legend font sizes could be larger for the
    line chart
  - Canvas utilization has some extra whitespace on the right side
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like interactive selections or layered
    annotations
  image_description: "The plot displays a well-organized 2×2 grid of four distinct\
    \ visualizations with a centered main title \"subplot-grid · altair · pyplots.ai\"\
    \ at the top. \n\n**Top-left (Scatter)**: \"Product Performance\" showing Units\
    \ Sold (x-axis, 0-1000) vs Revenue ($K) (y-axis, 0-100) with ~50 blue circles\
    \ of consistent size and good transparency.\n\n**Top-right (Line)**: \"Monthly\
    \ Sales Trend\" displaying two lines—solid blue for actual Sales and dashed yellow\
    \ for Target—spanning February to December. A legend labeled \"Metric\" distinguishes\
    \ the two series. The y-axis shows Sales ($K) ranging from ~500 to 1,150.\n\n\
    **Bottom-left (Bar)**: \"Regional Performance\" with 5 vertical bars for Central,\
    \ East, North, South, and West regions. Bars are conditionally colored—blue for\
    \ scores ≥80 (East, North) and yellow for <80 (Central, South, West). Y-axis shows\
    \ Performance Score (0-100).\n\n**Bottom-right (Histogram)**: \"Order Value Distribution\"\
    \ showing a right-skewed lognormal distribution of order values ($20-$420) with\
    \ frequency on the y-axis (0-50). Blue bars with good visibility.\n\nColor scheme\
    \ uses Python's signature blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B). All text is clearly\
    \ readable with appropriate font sizes. Grid lines are subtle."

        comment: All text is readable; subplot titles ~22pt, axis labels ~16-18pt,
          tick labels ~16pt. Slightly smaller than ideal for 4800×2700 but still good.

        comment: Scatter markers (size=120) are appropriately sized for 50 points.
          Line thickness (3) is good. Bar chart readable. Histogram bars could be

        comment: Grid opacity at 0.3 is subtle. Legend for line chart is well-placed
          but could be more prominent.

        comment: Values are realistic (revenue 10-100K, performance scores 0-100,
          order values $20-420). Sales starting at 500K and reaching 1150K is plausible
          but the cumulative growth pattern could be more realistic.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative grammar with hconcat/vconcat for grid layout,
          condition for color encoding, and scale/domain customization. Could leverage
          more interactive features or layering.
