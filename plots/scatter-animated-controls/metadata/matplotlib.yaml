review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Gapminder-inspired data storytelling with realistic GDP/life expectancy
    evolution
  - Creative static interpretation of animation via 2x2 faceted time series
  - Good use of watermark years in background for visual impact
  - Clean colorblind-friendly palette with white edge outlines on bubbles
  - Well-organized KISS code structure with clear data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes are below recommended guidelines (labels 14pt vs 20pt, ticks 12pt vs
    16pt)
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) and lime (#F0E442) colors are very similar, may cause confusion
  - Play/Pause indicator is purely decorative rather than functional matplotlib widgets
