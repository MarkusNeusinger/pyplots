review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE from scratch using Silverman's bandwidth rule
  - Creative use of AreaSeries with gradient fill for appealing density visualization
  - Rug plot implemented using ScatterSeries with distinctive diamond markers
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow contrast)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Realistic data scenario (human heights with male/female distribution)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent (alpha 0.25 could be reduced to 0.2)
  - Rug plot markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at the plot scale
  - The bimodal distribution is not clearly visible as two distinct peaks (appears
    more as a single peak with shoulder)
