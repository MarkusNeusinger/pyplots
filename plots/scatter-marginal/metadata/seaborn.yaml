review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn jointplot for this plot type, which is specifically designed
    for scatter plots with marginal distributions
  - Good visual balance with appropriate font sizes using sns.set_context(talk, font_scale=1.4)
  - Effective combination of histograms and KDE curves in marginal plots as suggested
    by the spec
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) and marker size for 200 data points with
    white edge for visibility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) instead of domain-specific labels with
    units
  - Data scenario is generic rather than representing a real-world use case
  - Grid uses dashed style which is slightly more prominent than subtle solid gridlines
