review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of real-time monitoring concept with clear current
    value annotation
  - Well-implemented fade effect indication with text annotation and threshold reference
    lines
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar including multiple geom layers
  - Professional color scheme with accessible colors (blue line, yellow highlight,
    red threshold)
  - Proper figure sizing with scale=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses letsplot instead of lets-plot - should match the official library name
    format
  - The point alpha gradient (fade effect) is implemented but barely visible in the
    output; the text annotation helps but actual visual fade would be stronger
  - Grid alpha at 0.5 could be more subtle (0.2-0.3 recommended)
