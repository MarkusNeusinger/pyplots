review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    from scratch
  - Clear community structure emerges naturally from the physics simulation
  - Good visual hierarchy with node sizing by degree, highlighting important hubs
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, coral avoids red-green confusion)
  - Clean use of LineCollection for efficient edge rendering
  - Appropriate labeling of only high-degree hub nodes to avoid clutter
  - Well-balanced canvas utilization with good margins
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap where two hub labels partially overlap their respective nodes
  - Python 3.10+ specific code (strict=True in zip) may cause compatibility issues
