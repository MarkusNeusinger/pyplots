review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing clusters, gaps, and outliers as specified
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Smart workaround using geom_segment to implement rug marks since lets-plot lacks
    native geom_rug
  - Good alpha transparency on density fill to avoid obscuring rug marks
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks are quite thin/small and could be slightly more prominent while still
    maintaining the small relative to plot requirement
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current alpha appears around 0.5, spec prefers
    0.2-0.4)
  image_description: The plot displays a basic rug plot with a density curve overlay.
    The visualization uses a blue color (#306998) for both elements. The density curve
    shows a bimodal distribution with a primary peak around 120ms and a secondary
    peak around 250ms, followed by a long right tail extending to ~800ms. Below the
    density curve, small vertical tick marks (the rug) are positioned along the x-axis
    at y=0 to ~0.0004, showing the exact location of each data point. The clustering
    is clearly visible in the rug marks - dense in the 80-180ms region, moderately
    dense around 200-300ms, sparse around 350-500ms, and a few isolated outliers extending
    to ~780ms. Title reads "rug-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" at top. X-axis labeled
    "Response Time (ms)", Y-axis labeled "Density". Light gray gridlines on minimal
    theme background.

        comment: Uses geom_segment for rug marks (creative workaround since letsplot
          lacks geom_rug), ggsize, theme customization, but no letsplot-specific interactive
          features leveraged
  verdict: APPROVED
