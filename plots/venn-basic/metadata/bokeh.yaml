review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen transparency (alpha=0.4) creating distinct
    overlap colors
  - Correct implementation of 3-set Venn diagram with accurate inclusion-exclusion
    calculations
  - Good use of Bokeh patch method for creating smooth circles
  - Proper title format and clean layout without unnecessary axes/grid
  - Interactive HTML output with hover tool
  weaknesses:
  - Set size labels (n=100, n=80, n=60) defined in code but not rendering visibly
    in output image
  - Hover tooltips could display actual region data instead of generic instructions
