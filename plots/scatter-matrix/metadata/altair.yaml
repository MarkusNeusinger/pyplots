review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of scatter matrix with histograms on diagonal and scatter
    plots off-diagonal
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue, orange, green)
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.6 for histograms, 0.7 for scatter) to handle
    overlapping
  - Appropriate use of the classic Iris dataset as realistic multivariate data
  - Proper title formatting following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Interactive HTML output alongside PNG
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is too small and disconnected from the main matrix - should be larger and
    better integrated
  - Does not leverage Altair native repeat() or facet() functionality for creating
    scatter matrices
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Manual loop-based construction is less elegant than Altair declarative approach
