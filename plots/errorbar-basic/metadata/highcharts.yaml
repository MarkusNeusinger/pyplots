review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native errorbar series type with proper whisker and
    stem configuration
  - Clear visible error bar caps with appropriate line widths
  - Professional typography with well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme (blue bars, black error bars)
  - Proper HTML export alongside PNG for interactivity
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate marginBottom for x-axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only shows Mean Value entry visible; the Error Range entry may be cut off
    or not rendering properly
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g. Measured Value units would be more informative)
  - Only demonstrates symmetric error bars; spec mentions asymmetric errors as a feature
  image_description: The plot shows a bar chart with error bars displaying experimental
    measurements for 6 samples (Sample A through Sample F). Blue column bars (#306998)
    represent the mean values ranging from approximately 35 to 52 on the y-axis. Black
    error bars with visible caps (whiskers) extend above and below each bar, showing
    the error ranges. The title "errorbar-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently
    displayed at the top in bold. A subtitle reads "Experimental measurements with
    error ranges". The x-axis is labeled "Experimental Samples" and the y-axis is
    labeled "Measured Value". A legend in the top-right shows "Mean Value" with a
    blue circle indicator. The grid uses dashed gray lines. The layout is clean with
    good use of canvas space.
