review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of phase space dynamics with four trajectories showing
    spiral convergence to equilibrium
  - Outstanding use of Altair declarative grammar with layered chart composition (base
    lines + starting points + equilibrium marker)
  - Starting point markers and equilibrium cross provide clear visual anchors for
    interpreting trajectories
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles with proper Euler method
    simulation
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should have spec-id as main title per SC-06 requirement
  - Axis labels lack units (radians and rad/s for physics context)
  image_description: The plot displays a damped pendulum phase diagram with four distinct
    trajectories in blue, yellow/gold, red/orange, and green colors. Each trajectory
    spirals inward toward the equilibrium point at the origin (marked with a black
    cross symbol). The starting points of each trajectory are marked with filled circular
    markers. The x-axis is labeled "Position (x)" ranging from approximately -2.0
    to 2.4, and the y-axis is labeled "Velocity (dx/dt)" ranging from -2.0 to 2.4.
    The title "Damped Pendulum Phase Space" appears at the top with subtitle "phase-diagram
    · altair · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right shows "Initial Condition" with four
    entries (IC 1 through IC 4) with their starting coordinates. The plot has a subtle
    dashed grid and good use of the canvas space.
