review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including max drawdown annotation,
    recovery markers, and statistics box
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color scheme (red for drawdowns, blue for
    baseline/recovery)
  - Well-structured code that generates realistic drawdown patterns with multiple
    cycles
  - Good use of matplotlib-specific features like fill_between, annotate with arrows,
    and custom legend handles
  - Statistics box provides valuable context (max DD, dates, duration, recovery time)
  weaknesses:
  - Recovery markers placed at y=0 but detection threshold is -0.01%, causing slight
    visual inconsistency
  - Missing secondary y-axis showing underlying price/value series as suggested in
    spec Notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart showing percentage decline
    from peak over a 2-year period (2022-01 to 2024-01). The drawdown line and filled
    area use a semi-transparent red/salmon color (#D9534F with alpha 0.4). A solid
    blue horizontal line at 0% marks the baseline. The maximum drawdown point (-24.3%)
    is highlighted with a dark red marker and annotated with an arrow pointing to
    "Max DD: -24.3%". Blue triangle markers indicate recovery points where new highs
    were reached. A statistics box in the lower-left displays key metrics: Max Drawdown
    (-24.3%), Max DD Date (2022-11-18), Peak to Trough (305 days), and Recovery (122
    days). The Y-axis shows "Drawdown (%)" with percentage formatting, X-axis shows
    "Date". Title follows the required format. Legend in upper-right explains the
    drawdown fill and recovery markers. Grid is subtle with dashed lines.'
