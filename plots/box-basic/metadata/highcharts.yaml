review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all box plot components (median, quartiles, whiskers,
    outliers)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each category
  - Proper 1.5*IQR whisker calculation with outliers displayed separately
  - Clean separation of box series and outlier scatter series
  - Good use of highcharts-core Python API with proper container specification
  - Data shows meaningful variation across groups demonstrating all box plot features
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Category, Value) - could use more contextual labels like
    Department and Score
  - Legend shows Distribution and Outliers which is functional but takes up space
    without adding much value for this simple plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally
    for Groups A through E. Each box is colored distinctly: blue (Group A), yellow
    (Group B), purple (Group C), cyan (Group D), and brown (Group E). The title "box-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. The X-axis is
    labeled "Category" with group names below each box. The Y-axis is labeled "Value"
    ranging from 0 to 125. Each box shows quartile ranges with dark median lines.
    Outliers are displayed as red circular points - visible for Groups A (one low
    outlier around 24), B (one high outlier around 105), C (two outliers around 19
    and 76), and E (one high outlier around 115). The distributions vary noticeably:
    Group D has the highest median (~70), Group C has the lowest (~45), and Group
    E shows the widest spread. Grid lines are subtle with light gray coloring. The
    layout is clean with a white background.'
