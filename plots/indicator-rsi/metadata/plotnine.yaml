review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of RSI technical indicator with all required visual elements
  - Clean grammar-of-graphics approach using proper layer composition
  - Good color choices for overbought/oversold zones with appropriate alpha transparency
  - Correct title format and professional axis labeling with 14-period notation
  - RSI calculation is correctly implemented inline without helper functions
  weaknesses:
  - panel_grid_major_y uses element_text() instead of element_line() which may not
    render grid as intended
  - Data could show RSI values reaching into the overbought zone (>70) more clearly
    to demonstrate full feature coverage
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart with a blue line showing RSI values over 120 trading days from
    January 2024 to June 2024. The Y-axis is fixed from 0 to 100 with tick marks every
    10 units. The chart includes a light red/pink shaded zone (70-100) indicating
    the overbought region, a light teal/green shaded zone (0-30) indicating the oversold
    region, a dashed red horizontal line at 70 (overbought threshold), a dashed teal
    horizontal line at 30 (oversold threshold), and a dotted gray centerline at 50.
    The RSI line clearly shows oscillations between approximately 15-70, entering
    both oversold territory (multiple times around January and May 2024) and approaching
    overbought levels (around April and June 2024). The title follows the correct
    format: "indicator-rsi · plotnine · pyplots.ai". X-axis is labeled "Date" with
    monthly labels, Y-axis is labeled "RSI (14-period)".'
