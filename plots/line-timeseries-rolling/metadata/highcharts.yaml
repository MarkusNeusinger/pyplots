review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow)
  - Clear differentiation between raw data (semi-transparent) and rolling average
    (bold)
  - Proper title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Realistic temperature data with seasonal trend that effectively demonstrates the
    rolling average concept
  - Rolling average properly shorter than raw data due to window requirements
  - Well-sized text elements for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis grid line alpha at 0.3 is slightly too prominent (0.2 would be more subtle)
  - Raw temperature line could be slightly thicker (current 3px) for better visibility
    against the rolling average
  image_description: The plot displays a time series of daily temperature readings
    over approximately 6 months (January to late June 2024). A semi-transparent blue
    line represents the raw temperature data showing daily volatility ranging from
    about 4°C to 35°C. A bold yellow/gold line overlays the raw data showing the 7-day
    rolling average, which smoothly reveals the seasonal warming trend from ~10°C
    in January to ~27°C by late April/May. The title "line-timeseries-rolling · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle "Daily Temperature with 7-Day
    Rolling Average". The x-axis shows dates with rotated labels every 2 weeks, and
    the y-axis displays "Temperature (°C)". A legend in the top-right corner clearly
    distinguishes "Raw Temperature" from "7-Day Rolling Average". Subtle grid lines
    are present on both axes.
