review:
  strengths:
  - Clean lollipop chart implementation using segment + scatter glyphs
  - Excellent use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Good color scheme with Python colors (blue stems, yellow markers)
  - Proper currency formatting on y-axis with NumeralTickFormatter
  - Well-sized elements for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Rotated x-axis labels prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Redundant sorting code (data is already defined in sorted order)
  - Bokeh toolbar icons visible in top-right corner could be hidden for cleaner static
    output
