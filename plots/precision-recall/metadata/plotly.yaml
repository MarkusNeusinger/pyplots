review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stepped line style (shape=hv) which accurately represents
    threshold-based changes
  - 'Comprehensive features: includes AP score, baseline reference, and iso-F1 curves
    as suggested in spec'
  - Clean, professional color scheme with good accessibility (blue/yellow instead
    of red/green)
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with realistic fraud detection
    scenario
  - Area fill under curve provides good visual representation of Average Precision
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only F1 = 0.2 for iso-F1 curves while 4 curves (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8)
    are visible - should either show all or use a different approach
  - No custom hover template to show threshold values or detailed information at each
    point on the curve
  - Plotlys distinctive interactivity could be better leveraged with click-to-select
    threshold functionality
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Precision-Recall curve on a white background
    with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main curve is shown in a deep blue color (#306998)
    with a stepped line style (horizontal-then-vertical) and light blue fill underneath
    (area under the curve). The title "precision-recall · plotly · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top in black text. The X-axis is labeled "Recall (Sensitivity)"
    ranging from 0 to 1, and the Y-axis is labeled "Precision (Positive Predictive
    Value)" also ranging from 0 to 1. A yellow dashed horizontal line shows the random
    baseline at 0.10 (the positive class ratio). Four iso-F1 curves are displayed
    as gray dotted lines. A legend in the bottom-left corner shows: "Classifier (AP
    = 0.812)", "Random Baseline (0.10)", and "F1 = 0.2". An annotation in the upper
    right reads "Iso-F1 curves". The grid is subtle with light gray lines.'
