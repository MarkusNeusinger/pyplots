# area-basic: Basic Area Chart

## Description

An area chart displaying a single data series as a filled region under a line. The filled area emphasizes magnitude and cumulative values over a sequence, making trends more visually impactful than simple line plots. Best suited for time series data where you want to highlight volume or accumulated quantities.

## Applications

- Visualizing website traffic volume over time
- Showing cumulative sales or revenue trends across quarters
- Tracking system resource usage (CPU, memory) over time
- Displaying temperature variations throughout a day

## Data

- `x` (numeric/datetime) - sequential values for the horizontal axis (typically time)
- `y` (numeric) - values for the vertical axis representing magnitude
- Size: 12-50 points
- Example: monthly sales data over a year
