review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean KISS code structure following the imports → data → plot → save pattern
  - Realistic survey data scenario with varied frequency distribution
  - Proper descending sort as suggested in the specification
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability and data communication
  - Professional appearance with removed top/right spines and subtle grid
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features (e.g., custom hatching, gradient
    fills, or annotation arrows)
  - Y-axis label "Count (Frequency)" is slightly redundant - could be simplified
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 5 bars representing
    product categories (Product A through E) on the x-axis. The bars are colored in
    Python Blue (#306998) with a darker edge color. Each bar has a bold count label
    above it showing the frequency values: Product A (154), Product B (118), Product
    C (97), Product D (76), and Product E (55). The bars are sorted in descending
    order by count. The y-axis shows "Count (Frequency)" ranging from 0 to 160, and
    the x-axis is labeled "Product Category". The title follows the correct format:
    "bar-categorical · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A subtle horizontal dashed grid is
    visible on the y-axis. The top and right spines are removed for a cleaner appearance.'

        comment: Uses standard matplotlib bar chart with Axes methods. Added value
          labels and spine removal are nice touches, but could leverage more matplotlib-specific
          features like custom tick formatting or annotations.
  verdict: APPROVED
