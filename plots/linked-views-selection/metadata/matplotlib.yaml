review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of the linked-views concept with three distinct coordinated
    visualizations
  - Clean consistent color encoding (blue for selected, gray for unselected) across
    all views
  - Good use of alpha transparency to de-emphasize unselected data
  - Informative annotation showing 50 selected count on the bar chart
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Clear title with selection count summary
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses two-line format with subtitle instead of single-line convention
  - Font sizes slightly below recommended guidelines (title 24pt recommended, uses
    20pt for subplot titles)
  - Static implementation - matplotlib widgets could add interactive selection capability
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays three coordinated views demonstrating linked selection functionality. The main title reads "linked-views-selection · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Selection: 50 of 150 points (Cluster B)".

    Left panel (Scatter Plot View): Shows X Coordinate vs Y Coordinate with gray circles representing unselected points (Cluster A and C) at reduced opacity, and blue (#306998) circles representing selected points (Cluster B) at higher opacity. The legend correctly identifies "Unselected" and "Selected (Cluster B)". Three distinct clusters are visible - selected Cluster B is concentrated around (5, 6).

    Middle panel (Histogram View): Displays Value Distribution with Frequency on y-axis. Gray bars show unselected data distribution, blue bars show the selected Cluster B distribution overlaid on top. The selected data peaks around values 40-50, clearly distinct from unselected data.

    Right panel (Category Distribution): A bar chart showing counts for Cluster A, Cluster B, and Cluster C. Cluster B is highlighted in blue with an annotation "50 selected" above it, while Cluster A and C are gray.

    A footer note in italic gray text reads "Selecting Cluster B in scatter plot highlights corresponding data in all views". All three views use consistent color encoding: blue (#306998) for selected and gray (#CCCCCC) for unselected.
