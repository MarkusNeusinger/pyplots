review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of box plot and strip plot overlay demonstrating the spec
    requirements perfectly
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Realistic and neutral data scenario (plant growth under light conditions)
  - Proper jitter implementation for strip points to show data distribution
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area rather than in the top-right
    corner
  - Some minor empty space at the top of the chart could be reduced
  - Median line (yellow) blends slightly with the strip points (also yellow) - different
    styling could improve distinction
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box plot with strip overlay showing plant
    growth (cm) across four light conditions: Low Light, Medium Light, High Light,
    and Full Sun. The box plots are rendered in blue (#306998) with semi-transparent
    fill and yellow (#FFD43B) median lines. Individual data points are overlaid as
    yellow circles with jitter for visibility. The title "cat-box-strip · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The y-axis shows "Plant Growth (cm)"
    ranging from ~2 to 64, and the x-axis shows the four light condition categories.
    A legend in the top-right corner distinguishes "Distribution Statistics" (blue)
    from "Individual Measurements" (yellow). The data shows increasing plant growth
    with more light exposure, with Full Sun having visible outliers both low (~20-22
    cm) and high (~58 cm).'
