review:
  strengths:
  - Shaded divergence region between curves is an excellent storytelling addition
    that goes beyond spec requirements
  - Annotations are well-designed with boxed styling, curved arrows, and intentional
    positioning
  - Color palette (Python Blue + complementary orange) is harmonious and colorblind-safe
  - Edge case handling for entropy at p=0 and p=1 is mathematically correct
  - Clean, minimal code with no over-engineering
  - Custom legend with title, appropriate font sizes, and refined frame styling
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some wasted space in lower corners due to the concave curve shape
  - Axis labels lack physical units (though these are dimensionless quantities)
  - Library mastery could be stronger — sns.lineplot adds minimal value over plt.plot
    for mathematical curves
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth curves on a single axes comparing
    Gini impurity (solid blue line, #306998) and Entropy (dashed orange line, #E8833A),
    both normalized to [0, 1]. The X-axis is labeled "Probability (p)" ranging from
    0.0 to 1.0, and the Y-axis is labeled "Impurity (normalized)" from 0.0 to approximately
    1.08. A light blue shaded region between the two curves highlights the divergence
    area. A dark dot marks the maximum impurity point at p = 0.5, y = 1.0, with a
    boxed annotation "Max impurity p = 0.5" connected by a curved arrow. An italic
    "Max divergence" annotation with an arrow points to the region of maximum divergence
    between the curves (around p ≈ 0.12). The legend in the upper right corner is
    titled "Splitting Criterion" and includes both formulas: "Gini: 2p(1−p)" and "Entropy:
    −p log₂p − (1−p) log₂(1−p)". Top and right spines are removed, with a subtle y-axis-only
    grid at low opacity. The title reads "line-impurity-comparison · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    in medium weight. Overall layout is clean and professional.'
