review:
  strengths:
  - Clean three-circle Venn diagram layout with proper overlapping regions
  - All seven region counts displayed clearly and readable
  - Good use of distinct colors with transparency for overlap visualization
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic data context using research fields (ML, Statistics, Data Engineering)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing random seed for reproducibility (data is deterministic but np imported)
  - Set labels could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - The Only C label (30) positioning could be improved - currently too close to the
    center region
  - Canvas utilization is good but could be slightly larger to fill more of the square
    format
