review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent HTML implementation with functional synchronized crosshairs via JavaScript
  - Realistic stock data scenario with price, volume, and RSI
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color choices that are colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of pygal Style customization
  weaknesses:
  - PNG preview shows single combined chart instead of stacked multi-chart dashboard
    layout
  - Normalization loses meaningful scale information for each series
  - Spec requires stacked vertical layout with charts sharing a common x-axis - PNG
    should show 3 separate charts stacked
  - For static libraries, spec notes to demonstrate the layout structure with annotations
    - the PNG should show the dashboard structure even if crosshairs cannot be interactive
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a single combined line chart with three normalized series over 200 trading days. The title reads "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. There are three line series:
    - Price (normalized) in blue - shows a peak early around Day 10 followed by a decline and fluctuation
    - Volume (normalized) in yellow - highly volatile vertical spikes throughout
    - RSI in red/coral - fluctuates in the 10-60 range

    The X-axis is labeled "Trading Day" with labels at intervals (Day 1, Day 23, Day 45, etc.) rotated at 45 degrees. The Y-axis on the left shows "Normalized Value" from 0-100, and there is a secondary Y-axis on the right also 0-100. The legend appears at the bottom with all three series labeled. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with horizontal grid lines visible.

    CRITICAL ISSUE: The PNG shows a single combined chart with all three series normalized to the same scale, rather than the stacked multi-chart dashboard layout specified. The spec requires "stacked vertical layout with charts sharing a common x-axis" with "independent y-axis scales for each chart." The HTML version does have 3 separate charts stacked vertically with crosshair synchronization, but the PNG preview fundamentally misrepresents the visualization type.
