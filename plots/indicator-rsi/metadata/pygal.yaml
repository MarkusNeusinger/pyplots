review:
  strengths:
  - Y-axis correctly fixed 0-100 with all three reference lines (70, 30, 50) as horizontal
    thresholds
  - RSI data demonstrates excellent feature coverage entering both overbought and
    oversold zones multiple times
  - Proper RSI calculation using EMA method with 14-period lookback
  - Good use of pygal Style customization for large canvas rendering
  - Clean smooth cubic interpolation makes the RSI trend easy to follow
  weaknesses:
  - Missing zone shading/highlighting for overbought (70-100) and oversold (0-30)
    regions as suggested in spec notes
  - Red/green color scheme for threshold lines could be improved for colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart rendered as a smooth blue line (cubic interpolation) showing RSI
    values over 120 trading periods. The Y-axis is correctly fixed from 0 to 100.
    Three horizontal reference lines are present: a red dashed line at 70 (overbought
    threshold), a green dashed line at 30 (oversold threshold), and a gray dotted
    line at 50 (centerline). The RSI line clearly enters both overbought territory
    (peaking at ~97) and oversold territory (dipping to ~14), demonstrating the full
    range of RSI momentum behavior. The title "indicator-rsi · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top. A legend at the bottom identifies all four elements with
    appropriate color coding. The layout has good proportions with the plot filling
    the canvas well.'
