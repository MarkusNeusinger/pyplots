review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and markers for the canvas dimensions
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that demonstrates clear line trends
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with good reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Appropriate use of dashed grid lines for subtle visual guidance
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries is imported from area module instead of the dedicated line module
  - Legend could be hidden for single-series plots to reduce visual clutter
  - Data shows smooth seasonal curve but lacks irregular variations that would better
    demonstrate line plot flexibility
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart showing monthly temperature data
    across a full year (January to December). The line is rendered in a dark blue
    color (#306998) with circular markers at each data point. The chart clearly shows
    a seasonal temperature pattern - cold winter months (Jan ~5°C, Dec ~6°C), rising
    through spring, peaking in summer (Jul ~29°C), and declining through autumn. The
    title "line-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis is
    labeled "Temperature (°C)" and the X-axis is labeled "Month". Subtle dashed horizontal
    grid lines help with value reading. The background is white with clean, professional
    styling.

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate, but legend shows "Temperature" which
          is somewhat redundant for a single-series plot
