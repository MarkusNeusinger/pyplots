review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib Slider widget with proper update callback
  - 'Beautiful visual design with Python colors (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Prominent year indicator badge makes current parameter value immediately visible
  - Realistic seasonal temperature pattern with subtle warming trend across years
  - Good use of fill_between for visual emphasis
  - Well-proportioned layout with slider positioned at bottom
  weaknesses:
  - Update function uses global fill variable which is not ideal but acceptable for
    widget callbacks
  - Play/pause animation feature mentioned in spec is not implemented
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing monthly temperature data
    for the year 2015. The chart has a blue line (#306998) connecting 12 data points
    representing each month (Jan-Dec), with yellow/gold (#FFD43B) circular markers
    at each point. There''s a light blue semi-transparent fill area under the curve.
    The title reads "slider-control-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in bold at the
    top. The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from -5 to 35, and the x-axis
    shows "Month" with abbreviated month names. A prominent yellow badge in the upper
    right displays "Year: 2015". At the bottom, there''s a slider widget labeled "Year"
    with the current value "2015" shown on the right side. The data shows a realistic
    seasonal temperature pattern with winter lows (~2-3°C) and a summer peak in July
    (~29°C).'

        comment: Uses `matplotlib.widgets.Slider` which is the core feature for this
          spec, plus `fill_between` and custom styling. Could use more advanced features
          like animation.
  verdict: APPROVED
