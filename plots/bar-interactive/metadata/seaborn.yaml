review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with well-sized text, clear annotations, and readable
    error bars
  - Creative simulation of hover tooltips using static annotations with tooltip-like
    styling
  - Good use of seaborn statistical features (errorbar=sd, capsize)
  - Colorbar provides additional context for color-value mapping
  - Professional styling with despine() and grid customization
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn cannot provide true interactivity (hover/click) as specified - library
    limitation
  - Legend position could overlap with annotations in certain layouts
  image_description: The plot displays a bar chart showing sales revenue across 6
    product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys).
    Bars are colored using a sequential Blues colormap where darker blue indicates
    higher sales values. Each bar includes error bars (standard deviation) and tooltip-like
    annotations positioned above each bar showing the mean value ± standard deviation
    and percentage of total sales. A colorbar on the right explains the color intensity
    mapping to sales magnitude. The title follows the correct format "bar-interactive
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axes are clearly labeled with "Product Category" on X
    and "Sales Revenue ($)" on Y. The legend in the upper right shows category colors.
    Grid lines are visible with subtle dashed styling.

        comment: Uses sns.barplot with statistical aggregation (errorbar=sd), sns.despine(),
          hue parameter correctly. However, interactive features are not possible
          in seaborn.
