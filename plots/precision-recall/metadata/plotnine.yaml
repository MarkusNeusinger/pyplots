review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (Python blue for curve, yellow
    for baseline)
  - Proper use of stepped line style (geom_step with direction=vh) accurately representing
    threshold-based curve
  - Clean annotation box with white background improves readability of AP score
  - Comprehensive axis labels with clarifying terms in parentheses
  - Proper implementation of precision-recall calculation from scratch
  - Good use of imbalanced dataset (80/20 split) demonstrating real-world applicability
  weaknesses:
  - Missing iso-F1 contour curves mentioned in specification (optional but would enhance
    the visualization)
  - Annotation text positioning could conflict with curve at different data distributions
  - No formal legend element; relies solely on inline annotations
