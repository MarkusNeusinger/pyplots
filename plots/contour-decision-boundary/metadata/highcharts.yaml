review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using dual axes to overlay scatter on heatmap
  - 'Correct colorblind-safe Python color scheme (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Good marker differentiation with circles vs diamonds and dark outlines
  - Proper KNN classifier implementation with probability-based coloring
  - Reproducible with fixed random seeds
  weaknesses:
  - Axis tick labels are mostly missing/invisible - only two values visible at bottom
    left corner
  - Legend on right side is cut off or too small to read
  - Color axis labels (0-1 scale) are barely visible
  - The dual-axis approach causes alignment issues between heatmap categorical indices
    and scatter actual values
