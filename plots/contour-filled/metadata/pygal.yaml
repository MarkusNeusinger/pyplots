review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent filled contour visualization achieved despite pygal not natively supporting
    contour plots
  - Creative SVG injection technique demonstrates advanced pygal customization
  - Smooth color gradients with 25 levels and proper diverging colormap
  - Marching squares algorithm for contour line overlay
  - Proper colorbar with Intensity label and tick marks
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced margins
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Contour overlay lines are quite subtle (opacity 0.4) and could be more visible
    for precise level identification
  - Code uses helper functions (interpolate_color, lerp) which deviates from KISS
    principle
  - Axis labels lack units - could use generic units like Position (a.u.) or similar
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization on a 4800×2700
    canvas. The title "contour-filled · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    dark gray text. The main plot area shows a 2D scalar field with multiple Gaussian
    peaks: a dominant red/dark red peak in the upper right quadrant (around x=1, y=1)
    representing positive values up to ~1.50, and a dark blue valley in the lower
    left quadrant (around x=-1, y=-1) representing negative values down to ~-0.98.
    Two additional smaller peaks are visible: one reddish peak in the lower right
    and one blue-ish region. The colormap transitions smoothly from dark blue (negative)
    through white (near zero) to dark red (positive). Subtle contour lines overlay
    the filled regions at approximately 0.4 opacity. Axis labels read "X Coordinate"
    and "Y Coordinate" with tick marks from -3.0 to 3.0. A colorbar on the right side
    labeled "Intensity" shows the value mapping from -0.98 to 1.50.'
