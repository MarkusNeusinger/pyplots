review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper font sizes, color choices, and layout
  - Realistic website traffic data with weekly patterns and upward trend effectively
    demonstrates the area chart strength in showing magnitude over time
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Proper use of semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.4) as recommended in spec
  - Y-axis starting at 0 correctly emphasizes the cumulative magnitude
  weaknesses:
  - The implementation uses matplotlib fill_between for the area rather than exploring
    seaborn native capabilities (though seaborn lacks a dedicated area chart function)
  - 'Grid legend scoring: single series plots could benefit from a subtle annotation
    or data source note'
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing website visitors
    over time (January 2024). The chart uses a semi-transparent blue fill (#306998
    Python Blue at alpha 0.4) with a darker blue line (linewidth 3) on top. The x-axis
    shows dates from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29 with rotated labels at 45 degrees. The
    y-axis shows visitor counts from 0 to approximately 7500. The title "area-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A clear weekly pattern is visible
    with dips on weekends (lower traffic) and peaks mid-week. There's also an overall
    upward trend. The gridlines are subtle with alpha 0.3 and dashed style.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot which is seaborn-native, but the area fill uses
          matplotlib's ax.fill_between. Seaborn doesn't have a native area chart function,
          so this hybrid approach is acceptable but doesn't showcase seaborn's distinctive
          features like regplot, kdeplot, or statistical aggregation.
