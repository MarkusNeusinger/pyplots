review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of arc diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics with
    geom_path for arcs
  - Arc heights proportional to node distance as specified, making long-range vs short-range
    connections visually distinct
  - Clean visual design with intentionally hidden axes creating a professional network
    visualization look
  - Good use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) to handle overlapping arcs
  - Weight-based arc thickness adds meaningful data encoding
  - Realistic character interaction scenario with meaningful connection patterns
  weaknesses:
  - The sys.path manipulation at the top is a workaround that could be cleaner
  - Some thin arcs (weight=1) are harder to distinguish from each other
