  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the grammar of graphics with proper layering (ggplot
    + geom_area + scales + labs + theme)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic market share scenario with meaningful trend data showing growth, decline,
    and stability
  - Proper percentage normalization in the data preparation
  - Good use of pd.Categorical for controlling stack order
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid and legend styling could be improved - legend appears slightly isolated from
    the plot area
  - The seed is set but data is actually hardcoded/deterministic, making the seed
    unnecessary
  - Could benefit from more dramatic proportion shifts to better demonstrate the plot
    type capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing tech product
    market share evolution from 2015-2024. Four categories are stacked: Laptops (coral/salmon
    at bottom), Wearables (teal/cyan), Tablets (yellow), and Smartphones (blue at
    top). The Y-axis ranges from 0% to 100% with clear percentage labels. The X-axis
    shows years from 2015 to 2023 in 2-year intervals. A legend on the right identifies
    each category as "Product Category". The title "area-stacked-percent · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top in bold. The chart shows interesting
    trends: Smartphones declining from ~45% to ~31%, Tablets declining from ~25% to
    ~9%, Wearables growing dramatically from ~5% to ~28%, and Laptops remaining relatively
    stable around 25-32%.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_area, scale_fill_manual, theme customization.
          Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics, but could leverage more advanced
          features like faceting or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
