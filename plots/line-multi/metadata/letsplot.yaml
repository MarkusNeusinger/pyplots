review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with explicit font sizes for all elements (28pt title, 22pt
    axis titles, 18pt axis/legend text)
  - Clean data generation creating distinct trend patterns (growth, seasonal, gradual)
    that demonstrate the multi-line comparison effectively
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar with long-format data and aes mappings
  - Good marker visibility with size=5 and alpha=0.9 on points
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs showcasing lets-plot dual static/interactive
    capability
  - Professional title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette (blue/yellow/red) while distinguishable could be more colorblind-safe;
    consider using scale_color_brewer or viridis
  - Legend title Product is generic; could be more contextual like Product Line
  - Could add tooltips for the HTML version to enhance interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-line comparison chart showing monthly
    sales data for three product lines over 12 months. The chart features three distinct
    colored lines: blue (#306998) for Electronics showing strong upward growth from
    ~155 to ~219 thousands USD, yellow (#FFD43B) for Clothing displaying a seasonal
    pattern starting at ~122, dipping to ~63 in August then recovering to ~78, and
    red (#DC2626) for Home Goods showing gradual growth from ~88 to ~104. Each line
    has circular markers at data points. The title "line-multi · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. X-axis shows month abbreviations (Jan-Dec), Y-axis shows
    "Sales (thousands USD)" ranging from 60-220. The legend is positioned on the right
    side with clear labeling. The background uses a subtle gray grid on white.'

        comment: Uses lets-plot ggplot grammar correctly with aes, geom_line, geom_point,
          scale_color_manual, theme_minimal, and ggsize. Also generates HTML for interactivity.
          However, doesn't showcase more advanced lets-plot features like tooltips,
          hover interactivity, or coord features.
  verdict: APPROVED
