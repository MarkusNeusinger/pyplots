review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color gradient that intuitively represents seasonal temperature patterns
    (blue=cold, yellow=warm)
  - Good implementation of KDE (kernel density estimation) inline without functions
  - Proper use of closed polygons to create filled density curves
  - Appropriate overlap between ridges creating the characteristic mountain ridge
    appearance
  - Realistic temperature data with proper seasonal variation
  - Clean, readable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis displays numeric values (0, 2, 4, ..., 24) instead of month labels as required
    by the spec - the custom y_labels with month names are not rendering correctly
  - Legend appears at bottom despite show_legend=False in code and spec requirement
    for Y-axis labels
