review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of EAN-13 encoding with all three encoding patterns (L,
    G, R codes)
  - Proper guard pattern rendering with extended height
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_rect for bars
  - Human-readable digits correctly positioned with first digit outside left guard
  - Uses realistic German product code from specification example
  weaknesses:
  - Could use element_rect for background styling instead of relying on element_blank
  image_description: 'The plot displays an EAN-13 barcode for the German product code
    "4006381333931". The barcode consists of black vertical bars of varying widths
    on a white background, with the standard EAN-13 structure clearly visible: start
    guard pattern (three thin bars on the left), six left-side digit encodings, center
    guard pattern (five thin bars in the middle), six right-side digit encodings,
    and end guard pattern (three thin bars on the right). The guard patterns extend
    slightly lower than the data bars, which is the correct EAN-13 format. Below the
    barcode, the 13 digits are displayed in black monospace font: "4" appears outside
    the left guard, followed by "006381" under the left data bars, and "333931" under
    the right data bars. The title "barcode-ean13 · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top in a clean, readable font.'
