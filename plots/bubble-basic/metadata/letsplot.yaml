review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the ggplot grammar of graphics with clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic market analysis scenario that clearly demonstrates the three-variable
    relationship
  - Perfect title format and well-labeled axes with units
  - Appropriate alpha (0.6) for handling overlapping bubbles
  - Good bubble size range (3-18) that shows variation without overwhelming the chart
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could have lower alpha for even more subtle appearance
  - Could leverage more letsplot-specific interactive features given the library strengths
    in this area
