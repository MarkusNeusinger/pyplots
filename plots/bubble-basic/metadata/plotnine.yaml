review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured to appropriate
    values
  - Idiomatic plotnine grammar of graphics usage with proper layer composition
  - Realistic data scenario (GDP vs life expectancy vs population) with plausible
    values
  - Correct use of scale_size_area for perceptually accurate bubble sizing
  - Clean minimal code following KISS structure perfectly
  - Custom x-axis formatting with dollar/k suffix adds polish
  weaknesses:
  - No color dimension used — adding a categorical color (e.g., region/continent)
    would improve storytelling and showcase the bubble chart full potential
  - Data is heavily clustered in the $10k-$30k range, leaving the right side of the
    plot mostly empty and wasting canvas space
  - Many small bubbles are nearly indistinguishable dots — the minimum bubble size
    should be increased or the data distribution adjusted
  - Visual design is competent but generic — lacks distinctive aesthetic sophistication
    needed for publication quality
  - No visual hierarchy or storytelling — all bubbles look the same so the viewer
    has no entry point into the data narrative
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with GDP per Capita (USD thousands)
    on the x-axis and Life Expectancy (years) on the y-axis. All bubbles are a single
    muted blue color (#306998) with alpha transparency (~0.6). Bubble size represents
    Population (M), with a size legend on the right showing reference circles for
    50 and 100. The title reads "bubble-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in large text
    at the top. The x-axis is formatted with dollar signs and "k" suffix ($20k, $40k,
    $60k), and the y-axis shows integer values from ~59 to 75. The data shows a positive
    correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy, with most points clustered
    in the $10k-$30k range and a few outliers extending to ~$75k. The minimal theme
    has light major grid lines and no minor grid. The overall layout is clean but
    the data clustering leaves significant empty space on the right side.
