review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to construct polar wedges manually
    in a library without native polar coordinate support
  - Good color progression from cool blues (calm) to warm orange (strong winds) following
    meteorological convention
  - Well-documented data representing realistic coastal wind patterns with clear prevailing
    SW direction
  - Clean separation of gridlines, spokes, wedges, and labels as separate data layers
  - Correct title format and appropriate figure sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Manual legend construction with geom_polygon is fragile; consider using a simpler
    approach or accepting plotnine default legend behavior
  - Chart is not centered due to asymmetric legend placement; consider repositioning
    legend or using a square canvas with legend inside the plot area
  - Frequency labels (5%, 10%, 15%) are quite small and hard to read; increase font
    size
  - The complex polygon construction makes the code harder to maintain; this is acceptable
    given plotnine limitations but worth noting
