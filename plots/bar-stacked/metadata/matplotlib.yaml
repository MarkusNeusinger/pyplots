review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle grid and removed spines
  - Total value labels above each bar enhance readability and match spec recommendation
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual contrast
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible revenue values
  - White edge lines between segments improve segment distinction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside plot area works but creates slight visual separation
    from data
  - Data could show more diverse trends (e.g., one component declining while others
    grow) to better demonstrate stacked bar utility for composition analysis
  - Could leverage matplotlib hatching patterns to further distinguish segments for
    accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    (Q1-Q4) for a business, with four product categories stacked: Software (dark blue
    at bottom), Hardware (yellow), Services (teal), and Support (coral/salmon at top).
    Each quarter''s bar shows the composition of revenue from these four sources,
    with total values labeled above each stack ($120M, $129M, $141M, $167M). The y-axis
    displays "Revenue (Millions USD)" ranging from 0 to 175, and the x-axis shows
    "Quarter" with Q1-Q4 labels. A legend is positioned outside the plot area in the
    upper right corner. The chart uses subtle horizontal grid lines and has clean
    styling with top and right spines removed.'

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3), but legend is outside the plot requiring
          bbox_inches='tight' - minor deduction for legend placement being slightly
          far from data

        comment: Good use of Axes methods (ax.bar with bottom parameter), spine customization,
          and tick_params, but doesn't leverage advanced matplotlib features like
          hatching patterns or annotations with arrows
  verdict: APPROVED
