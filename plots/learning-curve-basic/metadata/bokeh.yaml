review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh Band glyph for confidence intervals with appropriate transparency
  - Correct implementation of ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Good color choices (Python Blue and Gold) that are colorblind-accessible
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio (4800x2700) as required
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is too small and positioned too far in the bottom-right corner, making
    it difficult to read
  - Text elements (legend labels and tick marks) could be scaled up further for better
    readability on the large canvas
  - No interactive features configured (tooltips, hover) that would showcase Bokeh
    strengths in the HTML output
