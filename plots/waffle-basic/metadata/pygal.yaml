review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with rounded corners on squares giving a polished look
  - Perfect color palette with good contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean legend placement with percentages clearly shown
  - Correctly implements the 10x10 grid where each square = 1%
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that matches spec applications
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging pygal SVG nature
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a custom class instead of KISS script structure (pygal lacks built-in waffle
    chart, so this is justified)
  - Slight horizontal whitespace imbalance - could use more of the canvas width
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10x10 waffle chart (100 squares total) representing
    budget allocation across 4 categories. The grid is centered on a white background
    with the title "Budget Allocation · waffle-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the
    top. The squares have rounded corners and are colored: blue (#306998) for Operations
    (42 squares, top portion), yellow (#FFD43B) for Marketing (28 squares, middle
    portion), teal (#4ECDC4) for R&D (18 squares, lower-middle), and coral/salmon
    (#FF6B6B) for Admin (12 squares, bottom). A legend at the bottom shows each category
    with its percentage in parentheses: "Operations (42%)", "Marketing (28%)", "R&D
    (18%)", "Admin (12%)". The layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
