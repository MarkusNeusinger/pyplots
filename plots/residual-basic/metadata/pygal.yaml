review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Symmetric y-axis range around zero for visual balance as specified
  - Clear horizontal reference line at y=0 with dashed styling for visual distinction
  - Good marker visibility with increased dots_size (14) and appropriate transparency
    (0.6)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Outliers effectively demonstrate detection capability as intended
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-left corner overlaps with the upper plot area; bottom
    placement would be cleaner
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use more descriptive context)
  - Realistic context could be stronger with more specific scenario labeling
