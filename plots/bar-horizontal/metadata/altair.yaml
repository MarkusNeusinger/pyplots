review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-chosen font sizes (18pt labels, 22pt titles,
    28pt main title)
  - Clean declarative Altair code that follows the library grammar of graphics philosophy
  - Realistic and relatable data scenario (programming language popularity)
  - Proper sorting by value for easy comparison (largest to smallest)
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low opacity
  - Includes interactive tooltips with formatted values
  - Correct title format and overall professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be even more subtle or add value labels at bar ends for full
    points
  - All bars use same color - spec suggests highlighting specific bars could draw
    attention
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific interactivity features like selection/highlighting
    in HTML version
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing the "Top 10
    programming languages by popularity." Python sits at the top with the longest
    bar (~28.5%), followed by JavaScript (~18.2%), Java (~15.8%), and descending to
    Kotlin at the bottom (~1.6%). All bars use a consistent blue color (#306998 -
    Python Blue) with subtle rounded corners on the right end. The chart has a light
    dashed grid (alpha ~0.3) for reference. The y-axis shows "Programming Language"
    with all 10 language names clearly readable. The x-axis shows "Popularity (%)"
    ranging from 0 to 30. The title "bar-horizontal · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The layout is well-balanced with good use of canvas space.
