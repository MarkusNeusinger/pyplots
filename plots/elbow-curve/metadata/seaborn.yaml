review:
  strengths:
  - Clear elbow point annotation with arrow makes the key insight immediately visible
  - Excellent color scheme with Python-themed blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
    markers
  - Proper font sizing throughout (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Realistic inertia values showing typical K-means clustering behavior
  - Well-structured KISS code following project guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Uses sns.lineplot which is basic; could leverage seaborn statistical features
    more distinctively
  - Y-axis label could include units in parentheses format even if unitless (e.g.,
    Inertia (WCSS))
