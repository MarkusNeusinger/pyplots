review:
  strengths:
  - Semantic ring color gradient (green to pink) communicates adoption readiness at
    a glance
  - Effective label repulsion algorithm prevents text overlap across 24 items
  - 'Complete spec compliance: all features from the specification are implemented'
  - Interactive tooltips via layer_tooltips() add value in HTML export
  - Realistic technology data with sensible ring placements reflecting actual adoption
    status
  - Clean code structure with helpful section comments
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation label font size (12) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - Some whitespace between the plot area and bottom legend could be reduced
  - Left side (AI & ML sector) shows minor label crowding with 6 items concentrated
    there
  - Ring label font size (12) is adequate but could benefit from being slightly larger
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree radar/innovation radar chart
    on a white background. Four concentric ring bands fill the arc from the center
    outward: a green "Adopt" ring, a yellow "Trial" ring, an orange "Assess" ring,
    and a pink/red "Hold" ring. The ring labels appear at the top gap of the arc with
    white-filled background boxes. Four angular sectors divide the arc — "AI & ML"
    (upper-left), "Biotech" (lower-left), "Sustainability" (lower-right), and "Infrastructure"
    (upper-right) — with bold sector headers along the outer edge. Twenty-four innovation
    items are plotted as colored dots: blue for AI & ML, deep pink for Biotech, teal
    for Sustainability, and orange for Infrastructure. Each dot has a thin gray connector
    line leading to its text label, placed to the left or right with outward alignment.
    Labels have been separated by a repulsion algorithm to minimize overlap. A legend
    at the bottom maps sector colors. The title "radar-innovation-timeline · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left in bold.'
