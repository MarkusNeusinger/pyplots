review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized elements and readable text at all levels
  - Clear demonstration of asymmetric error bars with visible caps
  - Proper title format and informative caption explaining the error bounds
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure following lets-plot conventions
  - Good use of theme_minimal() with subtle grid customization
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs as expected for lets-plot
  weaknesses:
  - The interactive HTML version does not include tooltips to show exact values on
    hover
  - Grid/Legend score reduced because there is no formal legend element (caption serves
    the purpose but is not a legend)
  image_description: The plot displays a quarterly sales performance visualization
    with asymmetric error bars. Four data points (Q1-Q4) are shown as blue circular
    markers on a clean white background with subtle gray gridlines. Each quarter has
    vertical error bars with horizontal caps at both ends - the asymmetry is clearly
    visible where upper and lower bars have different lengths. Q4 shows the largest
    upside potential (error bar extending to ~127), while Q3 shows the largest downside
    risk (extending down to ~66). The title "errorbar-asymmetric · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. The y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands USD)" and
    x-axis shows "Quarter". A caption at the bottom right explains "Error bars represent
    10th-90th percentile forecast range". The color scheme uses a consistent blue
    (#306998) for all elements.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.3), but no legend present - the caption serves
          as explanation but a formal legend would be better

        comment: Shows clear asymmetry with different upper/lower errors across quarters;
          Q2 has large upside, Q3 has large downside - demonstrates the key feature
          well but could show more extreme asymmetry

        comment: Good use of ggplot2-style grammar with geom_errorbar and geom_point,
          theme customization, but could leverage more lets-plot specific features
          like tooltips for the interactive HTML version
  verdict: APPROVED
