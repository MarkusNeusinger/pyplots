review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of variable-width stacked bars using geom_rect with precise
    coordinate calculations
  - Clean, readable code with well-documented data transformation logic
  - Professional appearance with white borders between segments enhancing visual separation
  - Smart conditional labeling showing values only on segments >10% for readability
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics (aes, scales, themes)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines on y-axis could use alpha transparency for subtler appearance
  - Legend is sorted alphabetically rather than matching the stacking order in the
    bars
