review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib's streamplot with color-mapped velocity magnitude
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Viridis colormap ensures colorblind accessibility
  - Proper title format and well-sized text elements
  - Vortex flow pattern clearly demonstrates streamline concept
  - Good use of equal aspect ratio for proper visualization of circular flow
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "X Position (m)" or similar)
  - Grid linestyle dashed is slightly more visible than needed
  - Could use linewidth varying with speed for additional visual encoding
  - Flow field could be more complex (e.g., dipole) to show more features
  image_description: The plot displays a basic streamline visualization showing a
    vortex flow field. The streamlines form concentric circular patterns spiraling
    around a central point (origin). Colors range from deep purple/blue at the center
    (low velocity ~0.5) to bright yellow-green at the outer edges (high velocity ~4.0),
    using the viridis colormap. The plot has a title "streamline-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axis labels show "X Position" and "Y Position" ranging
    from -3 to 3. A vertical colorbar on the right indicates "Velocity Magnitude".
    The background includes a subtle dashed grid. Arrows along the streamlines indicate
    flow direction (counterclockwise).

        comment: Uses ax.streamplot which is matplotlib's native streamline function
          with color mapping and arrows; could use additional features like varying
          linewidth with speed
  verdict: APPROVED
