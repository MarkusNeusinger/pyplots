review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib's streamplot with color-mapped velocity magnitude
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Viridis colormap ensures colorblind accessibility
  - Proper title format and well-sized text elements
  - Vortex flow pattern clearly demonstrates streamline concept
  - Good use of equal aspect ratio for proper visualization of circular flow
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "X Position (m)" or similar)
  - Grid linestyle dashed is slightly more visible than needed
  - Could use linewidth varying with speed for additional visual encoding
  - Flow field could be more complex (e.g., dipole) to show more features
