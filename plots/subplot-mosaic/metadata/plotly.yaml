review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent mosaic layout implementation using Plotly make_subplots with colspan
    specifications to achieve the AAB/CCD/EFG pattern
  - Well-designed business dashboard scenario with coherent data narrative
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear comments explaining
    the layout pattern
  - Good visual hierarchy with larger panels for primary data and smaller panels for
    supporting metrics
  - Proper use of Plotly white template and consistent color scheme
  - Correctly implements both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter plot markers in Product Performance panel are slightly small (size=12)
    for 80 data points at this canvas size
  - Missing demonstration of empty cell/gap feature using placeholder mentioned in
    spec
  - Bottom row metric panels feel slightly cramped; row_heights could be adjusted
    for better balance
