review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with clear hierarchical structure
  - Excellent color-coded clusters that are colorblind-accessible
  - Good use of Plotly figure_factory for dendrogram creation
  - Realistic Iris flower dataset example that matches spec suggestion
  - Well-formatted title following pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate line width (3) for visibility at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain what the cluster colors represent
  - Unconventional inline lambda import for scipy linkage function
  - Could add hover information to display sample details interactively
