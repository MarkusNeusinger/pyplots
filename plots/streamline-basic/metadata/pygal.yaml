review:
  strengths:
  - Clean circular vortex pattern clearly visualizes flow field topology
  - Good use of pygal XY chart to approximate streamlines without native support
  - Large font sizes appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Legend at bottom with multiple columns avoids plot obstruction
  - White background with subtle grid provides clean presentation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels in output do not match the code definition - investigate cairosvg
    rendering or pygal label handling
  - Two blue colors (Inner and Near-Inner) are very similar and hard to distinguish
    - use more contrasting colors
  - Only 4 radii in code but legend shows 5 categories - synchronize legend with actual
    data series
  - Spec suggests color encoding velocity magnitude along streamlines but current
    implementation uses radial distance for color
