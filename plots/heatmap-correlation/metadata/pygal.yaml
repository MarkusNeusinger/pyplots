review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom implementation extending pygal's Graph class to create a heatmap
    (pygal doesn't have native heatmap support)
  - Beautiful diverging colormap with smooth interpolation between colors
  - Smart adaptive text color based on background brightness for optimal readability
  - Professional colorbar with clear labels and title
  - Realistic financial portfolio metrics data showcasing various correlation strengths
  - Clean visual design with rounded corners and consistent spacing
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML outputs leveraging pygal's SVG nature
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a custom class instead of simple script structure (though justified since
    pygal lacks native heatmap support)
  - Column labels could be slightly larger for better readability
  - No axis titles (though not strictly needed for correlation matrices where variables
    serve as labels)
