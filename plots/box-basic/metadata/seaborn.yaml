review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three targeted, color-coded annotations that
    guide the viewer to key insights
  - 'Strong seaborn idiom: boxplot + stripplot layering with proper hue/palette API
    compatibility'
  - Diverse data generation with normal distributions plus exponential for Sales showcasing
    distributional variety
  - 'Publication-quality formatting: dollar-formatted ticks, explicit font sizes,
    despine, subtle grid'
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario with appropriate salary ranges
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two orange-adjacent colors (Marketing #E8A838, HR #FF7043) are somewhat close
    for color-vision deficient viewers'
  - Strip plot points slightly overlap in dense regions of Engineering and Sales boxes
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots comparing salary distributions
    across departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance). Each box has
    a distinct color: Engineering in deep blue (#306998), Marketing in golden orange
    (#E8A838), Sales in green (#4CAF50), HR in coral orange (#FF7043), and Finance
    in purple (#9C27B0). Individual data points are overlaid via strip plot with alpha
    transparency (0.4), showing the raw distribution alongside the box plot summaries.
    The y-axis shows salary in dollar format ($40K-$140K), the x-axis shows department
    names. Three annotation arrows highlight key insights: "Highest median: $93K"
    pointing to Engineering (blue text/arrow), "Right-skewed distribution" pointing
    to Sales (green text/arrow), and "Widest IQR: $22K spread" pointing near HR (purple
    text/arrow). Top and right spines are removed. A subtle y-axis grid (alpha 0.2)
    is present. Title reads "box-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in medium weight at
    the top.'
