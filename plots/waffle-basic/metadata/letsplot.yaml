review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waffle chart using geom_tile with proper grid construction
  - Perfect legend formatting showing category names with percentages
  - Clean color palette starting with Python Blue (#306998) as required
  - Proper use of theme_void() for waffle chart aesthetics
  - Correct 10x10 grid (100 squares = 1% each) as specified
  - Good use of pd.Categorical to preserve category order in legend
  - Saves both PNG and HTML for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Could add interactive tooltips (tooltip parameter) to leverage lets-plot interactivity
    features
  - Canvas utilization could be slightly improved - waffle grid appears a bit small
    relative to total canvas
