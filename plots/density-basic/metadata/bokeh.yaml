  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule for bandwidth selection
  - Clean rug plot implementation showing individual observations as vertical segments
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Bimodal data effectively demonstrates distribution analysis use case
  - Realistic web service response time scenario with meaningful context
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive capabilities (hover tooltips showing density
    values)
  - Grid styling could be more prominent for better readability
  - The rug plot ticks could be slightly more visible (currently line_width=2 with
    alpha=0.5)
  image_description: The plot displays a bimodal density curve (KDE) showing web service
    response times in milliseconds. The main peak is around 150ms (fast responses)
    with a secondary smaller peak around 280ms (slower responses). The curve is filled
    with a semi-transparent blue color (#306998) with a solid blue outline. A rug
    plot showing individual observations appears as small vertical lines along the
    x-axis at the bottom. The title "density-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is positioned
    at the top left. X-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" and Y-axis is labeled
    "Density". The background is a light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines.
    The layout uses the full 16:9 landscape format.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.3), but no legend present (acceptable for
          single-series density plot, but could note the distribution)

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and varea/line/segment glyphs correctly, but
          doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive features (hover tooltips, interactive
          HTML output). For static PNG export, the implementation is solid but doesn't
          showcase Bokeh's unique strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
