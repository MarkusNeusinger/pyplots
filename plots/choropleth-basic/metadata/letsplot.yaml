review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot geocode_countries() for automatic boundary retrieval
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate coordinate limits focusing on Europe
  - Good colorblind-accessible yellow-blue color scheme
  - Proper missing data handling with na_value parameter
  - Well-structured theme with appropriate removal of axes/grid for map visualization
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactive capability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be larger and more prominent for better readability at full size
  - Some European countries missing from data (UK, Iceland, Southern Europe) - more
    coverage recommended
  - Extreme outlier (Luxembourg 126.4k) compresses color scale making mid-range countries
    harder to distinguish
