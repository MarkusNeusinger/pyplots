review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent calendar grid layout with proper week/weekday structure
  - GitHub contributions theme is instantly recognizable and appropriate
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and hover tooltips for interactivity
  - Clean sequential green colormap matching GitHub aesthetic
  - Proper handling of categorical y-axis with reversed weekday order (Mon at top)
  - White cell borders provide excellent visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Color bar label Contributions appears slightly truncated at the canvas edge
  image_description: The plot displays a GitHub-style calendar heatmap for 2024. It
    shows a grid of rectangular cells arranged with weekdays (Mon-Sun) on the y-axis
    and months (Jan-Dec) on the x-axis. Each cell represents a day, colored using
    a sequential green palette (Greens9) where lighter greens indicate lower contribution
    counts and darker greens indicate higher activity. The title "GitHub Contributions
    2024 · heatmap-calendar · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. A color
    bar on the right shows the "Contributions" scale from 0 to approximately 14. The
    layout clearly shows the typical GitHub contribution pattern with lower weekend
    activity (lighter Sat/Sun rows) and occasional bursts of high activity (dark green
    cells). White borders separate each cell for clarity.
