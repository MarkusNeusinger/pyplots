review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts datetime axis with proper formatting
  - Clean color scheme using Python-themed colors (blue/yellow) plus purple
  - Interactive HTML version generated alongside PNG
  - Shared tooltips with crosshairs enhance interactivity
  - Appropriate line widths differentiate price from EMAs
  - Proper z-index layering ensures price line is on top
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a function definition (calc_ema) which violates KISS structure principle
    - should use inline calculation or pandas EMA
  - Could highlight EMA crossover points as suggested in the specification
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a stock price time series chart with 120 trading days from June 2024 to November 2024. Three lines are shown:
    1. Close Price (blue solid line) - the most prominent line showing daily price fluctuations with significant volatility
    2. EMA 12 (yellow/gold solid line) - short-period exponential moving average, closely tracking the price
    3. EMA 26 (purple dashed line) - longer-period EMA, smoother and lagging behind

    The title reads "indicator-ema · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Stock Price with 12-day and 26-day EMAs". The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging from approximately $119 to $166. The X-axis shows dates with monthly intervals (Jul 2024 through Nov 2024). A legend at the bottom clearly identifies all three series. The data shows a downtrend from ~$163 to ~$123 followed by a recovery to ~$135. The layout is clean with a white background and subtle grid lines.
