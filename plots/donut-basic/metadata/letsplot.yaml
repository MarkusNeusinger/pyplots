review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_pie with hole parameter for native donut chart creation
  - Clean center annotation using geom_label showing total budget
  - Well-formatted percentage labels using layer_labels().format()
  - Colorblind-safe palette with Python blue as primary color
  - Proper categorical ordering to maintain consistent segment order
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart for better visual cohesion
  - No explicit random seed (though data is deterministic, best practice to include)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart showing budget allocation by
    department. The chart has a hollow center containing "Total $100M" text. Five
    colored segments represent different departments: Marketing (28.0%, Python blue
    #306998), Operations (22.0%, yellow), R&D (25.0%, green), Sales (18.0%, orange),
    and HR (7.0%, purple). Each segment has a percentage label positioned on the segment.
    A legend titled "Department" appears on the right side listing all five categories
    with corresponding color markers. The title "donut-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The overall layout is clean with good whitespace balance.'
