review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent compliance with specification including both gain curve and random baseline
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color scheme with blue-yellow contrast
  - Professional gradient area fill that enhances visual appeal
  - Appropriate subtitle providing context for the data scenario
  - Proper use of highcharts-core Python API with correct chart sizing
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box overlaps the data visualization area; consider repositioning to top-left
    corner or outside the plot area
  - Could add annotations to highlight key insights (e.g., 50% of positives captured
    with 10% targeting)
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative gains chart with a blue-filled
    area curve ("Model Gain") that rises steeply from the origin, capturing approximately
    90% of positive cases by targeting just 20% of the population, and reaches 100%
    around 50% population. A yellow dashed diagonal line ("Random Selection") represents
    the baseline random model. The title "gain-curve · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top with subtitle "Customer Response Model Performance". X-axis shows "Population
    Targeted (%)" from 0-100, Y-axis shows "Positive Cases Captured (%)" from 0-100.
    Both axes have 10-unit tick intervals with subtle dashed grid lines. A white-background
    legend box positioned in the right portion of the chart shows both series. The
    area fill uses a gradient from solid blue (#306998) at top to light transparent
    blue at bottom.

        comment: Good use of AreaSeries with gradient fill_color and SplineSeries
          for smooth baseline; tooltip configuration present. Could leverage more
          Highcharts-specific features like annotations or hover effects.
  verdict: APPROVED
