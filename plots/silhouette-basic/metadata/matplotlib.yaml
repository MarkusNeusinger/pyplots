review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib fill_betweenx for creating characteristic silhouette
    bar shapes
  - Uses real iris dataset as specified, providing meaningful clustering context
  - Clear visual separation between clusters with gaps and distinct colors
  - Proper cluster annotations showing average silhouette scores for each group
  - Well-positioned reference line with legend explaining overall average score
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could be simplified since individual sample indices are not meaningful
  - All silhouette values are positive; showing some negative values would better
    demonstrate full range
  image_description: 'The silhouette plot displays three clusters from the iris dataset
    as horizontal filled areas. Cluster 0 (Python blue, #306998) is at the bottom
    with an average score of 0.42, showing samples with silhouette values ranging
    from near 0 to about 0.7. Cluster 1 (yellow, #FFD43B) is in the middle with the
    highest average of 0.80, displaying consistently high silhouette values. Cluster
    2 (green, #2ca02c) is at the top with an average of 0.45. A red dashed vertical
    line marks the overall average silhouette score of 0.55. The x-axis shows "Silhouette
    Coefficient" ranging from -0.2 to 1.0, and the y-axis is labeled "Sample Index
    (by Cluster)" with no tick marks. Each cluster is annotated with its name and
    average score. The title reads "silhouette-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A
    legend in the lower right shows the average score line.'
