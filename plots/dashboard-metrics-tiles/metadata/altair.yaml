review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with professional dashboard appearance
  - Smart use of Altair declarative composition (vconcat/hconcat) for grid layout
  - 'Thoughtful change indicator logic (context-aware: green for favorable changes,
    red for unfavorable)'
  - Gradient fills on sparklines add visual polish
  - Consistent tile sizing and spacing throughout
  - Clean color palette with good accessibility (arrows supplement colors)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a function create_tile() which violates the KISS principle (should use inline
    code or list comprehension style)
  - Missing status color coding from spec (good/warning/critical states)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a professional 3x2 grid of 6 dashboard metric tiles on a clean white background. The main title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue (#306998). Each tile contains a large metric value, label, sparkline area chart, and change indicator.

    Top row tiles:
    - CPU Usage: 45% with downward green arrow showing ▼ 5.2% (favorable decrease)
    - Memory: 72% with upward red arrow showing ▲ 8.1% (unfavorable increase)
    - Response Time: 120ms with downward green arrow showing ▼ 15.3% (favorable decrease)

    Bottom row tiles:
    - Requests/sec: 2,847 with upward green arrow showing ▲ 12.4% (favorable increase for throughput)
    - Error Rate: 0.8% with upward red arrow showing ▲ 0.3% (unfavorable increase)
    - Disk I/O: 156MB/s with downward green arrow showing ▼ 2.1% (favorable decrease)

    Each tile features a sparkline area chart with blue line (#306998) and gradient fill showing recent trend history. The sparklines use 20 data points and show varied patterns consistent with each metric's change direction. All tiles have consistent sizing with rounded corner borders (#e0e0e0) and proper spacing. The layout is balanced and professional, suitable for an operations monitoring dashboard.
