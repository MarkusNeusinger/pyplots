review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive implementation of the efficient frontier concept with all key elements
    (frontier line, random portfolios, special markers)
  - Excellent use of Sharpe ratio color-coding to visualize portfolio efficiency
  - Proper calculation of minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal Style system for consistent styling
  - Interactive HTML export leverages pygal SVG strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Min Variance marker is smaller than expected and harder to see compared to Max
    Sharpe marker
  - X-axis extends to 30% but data only goes to ~24%, creating unnecessary empty space
  - Y-axis starts at 0% but data starts around 8%, wasting vertical space
  - Text could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Frontier line color blends somewhat with yellow mid-Sharpe points
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. The chart shows a scatter plot of approximately 300 random portfolios
    with risk (standard deviation) on the x-axis (5%-30%) and expected return on the
    y-axis (0-24%). The portfolios are color-coded by Sharpe ratio into three groups:
    blue dots for "Low Sharpe (<0.66)", yellow/orange dots for "Mid Sharpe (0.66-0.68)",
    and green dots for "High Sharpe (≥0.68)". The efficient frontier is drawn as a
    red/orange line connecting optimal portfolios from the minimum variance point
    to the maximum return. Two special markers are shown: a small purple dot for "Min
    Variance" portfolio (around 12% risk, 10% return) and a larger black dot for "Max
    Sharpe" portfolio (around 14.5% risk, 12.5% return). The title correctly follows
    the format "frontier-efficient · pygal · pyplots.ai". Axis labels are descriptive
    with percentage formatting. A legend at the bottom shows all six series with colored
    squares.'
