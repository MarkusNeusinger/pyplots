review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of forest plot structure with clear visual hierarchy
  - Proper diamond shape for pooled estimate using geom_polygon
  - Study labels and effect size values clearly displayed on left and right sides
  - Good color choices with Python blue (#306998) and yellow accent (#FFD43B)
  - Appropriate sizing for all text elements following quality guidelines
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic meta-analysis data context with meaningful study names
  weaknesses:
  - All individual study effects are negative; including some positive effects would
    better demonstrate the plot ability to show heterogeneous results
  - Grid lines only on x-axis (though appropriate for forest plots, full grid could
    be considered)
