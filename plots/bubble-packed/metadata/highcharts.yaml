review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native packedbubble chart type with proper layout
    algorithm configuration
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between sectors
  - Clean grouping of bubbles by sector with splitSeries enabled
  - Subtitle effectively explains the size encoding
  - Interactive HTML version also generated for web viewing
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format should lead with spec-id: bubble-packed · Market Sectors · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai'
  - Layout has excessive empty space around the packed bubbles - could use tighter
    packing or larger minSize
  - Some smaller categories (Cybersecurity, Fintech, Utilities, Entertainment, Healthcare
    Services) have no visible labels due to the value filter threshold
