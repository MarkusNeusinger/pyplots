  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling through enriched legend names and on-slice contextual
    labels that guide the viewer
  - Strong colorblind-safe palette with good visual separation via white stroke between
    slices
  - Creative use of pygal SVG node transform for slice explosion effect — distinctly
    pygal approach
  - Clean flat code structure with deterministic data and no unnecessary dependencies
  - Perfect spec compliance with all four required features implemented
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label crowding in the OPPO and vivo small slices — tight but still readable
  - Slight excess whitespace above the title area
  - Monospace font rendering from pygal SVG-to-PNG pipeline is functional but not
    as polished as proportional fonts
  image_description: 'The plot shows a pie chart on a white 3600x3600 background titled
    "Smartphone Market Share · pie-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top in dark
    text. Six slices represent global smartphone market share: Apple (blue, 23.3%),
    Samsung (orange, 19.4%), Xiaomi (teal, 14.1%), OPPO (rose/pink, 8.7%), vivo (purple,
    7.5%), and Others (gray, 27.0%). Each slice displays a white percentage label.
    The "Others" slice is slightly exploded outward for emphasis. Apple''s slice carries
    an additional "#1 brand" label and the Others slice shows "Largest." White strokes
    separate all slices. A bottom legend in two rows of three uses enriched names:
    "Apple (#1 brand)", "Samsung (#2 worldwide)", "Xiaomi", "OPPO", "vivo", "Others
    (largest segment)." Colors are distinct and colorblind-safe (blue, amber, teal,
    rose, purple, gray).'
