review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized annotations and contrasting text colors
    on cells
  - Properly follows specification with True/Predicted axis labels and Blues colormap
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with believable confusion patterns showing
    systematic errors
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Square format appropriate for symmetric confusion matrix
  weaknesses:
  - Minor colorbar label duplication (label set both in cbar_kws and manually)
  - Data is deterministic but no explicit np.random.seed() for documentation purposes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 confusion matrix heatmap for sentiment
    analysis classification with four classes: Negative, Neutral, Positive, and Mixed.
    The matrix uses a sequential blue colormap ("Blues") where darker blues indicate
    higher counts. Cell annotations show the raw count values in bold white/black
    text. The diagonal cells (correct predictions) are prominently darker: Negative=156,
    Neutral=142, Positive=168, Mixed=125. Off-diagonal cells show misclassification
    patterns with lighter shading. The y-axis is labeled "True Label", x-axis is "Predicted
    Label". A colorbar on the right shows the count scale from ~0 to 168. The title
    reads "Sentiment Analysis Model · confusion-matrix · seaborn · pyplots.ai". White
    gridlines separate cells clearly. X-axis labels are rotated 45° for readability.'
