review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme (blue-white-red) properly centered at zero with
    correct -1 to 1 limits
  - Clear cell annotations with bold black text ensuring readability against all background
    colors
  - Well-constructed financial metrics dataset with meaningful correlations demonstrating
    various correlation strengths
  - Proper use of coord_fixed() for square cells and ggsize() for appropriate dimensions
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Wildcard import from lets_plot import * could be more explicit for better code
    clarity
  - The HTML output could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features for correlation
    exploration
  - The Variable axis labels are generic - could be more descriptive (e.g., Financial
    Metric)
