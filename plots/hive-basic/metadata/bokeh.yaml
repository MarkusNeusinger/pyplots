review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the hive plot concept with proper radial axis arrangement
  - Beautiful bezier curves for edges with color coding by source axis
  - Clean, professional color palette (Python blue/yellow + green) that is colorblind
    accessible
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for node rendering
  - Realistic software module dependency network example matching spec suggested use
    case
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output, leveraging Bokeh web capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'Canvas utilization is poor: plot elements occupy roughly 40% of the 3600x3600
    canvas with large empty margins'
  - Node sizes could be increased for better visibility at this canvas size
  - Missing node labels that would help identify individual modules
  - Text sizes (32pt title, 24pt labels) could be larger for better readability on
    the full canvas
  - Axis lines could be thicker/more prominent to better define the radial structure
