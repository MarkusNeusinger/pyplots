review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent visual indicators for real-time effect: LIVE badge, scroll direction
    arrow (▶), current value highlight with yellow stroke'
  - Good use of Altair's layered composition combining area fill, line, and point
    marks
  - Opacity gradient on markers effectively conveys time progression (older = more
    transparent)
  - Clean, professional appearance with proper title format and descriptive subtitle
  - Appropriate use of temporal axis formatting (HH:MM:SS)
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what the blue line represents (though subtitle helps)
  - Data range could show more dramatic variation to better demonstrate real-time
    fluctuations
  - Y-axis fixed at 0-100 leaves ~60% of vertical space unused for this data range
  image_description: The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitoring chart with
    a blue line showing usage percentages (0-100%) over approximately 5 seconds of
    time (14:30:05 to 14:30:09). The line has a light blue area fill beneath it and
    small circular markers on each data point that fade in opacity from left to right
    (older to newer). The current/latest value (20.2%) is prominently displayed with
    a larger yellow-outlined marker on the right side. A red "● LIVE" indicator appears
    in the top-left corner, and an orange play button (▶) is positioned in the upper-right,
    suggesting the scrolling direction. The title follows the correct format "line-realtime
    · altair · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "CPU Usage Monitor - Live Data Stream (Sliding
    Window)". The y-axis is labeled "CPU Usage (%)" and the x-axis is labeled "Time"
    with HH:MM:SS format.
