review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario using programming language names for embedding
    visualization
  - Clean, well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of distinct colors for each language name
  - Appropriate axis labeling for dimensionality reduction context
  - Well-balanced layout with good margins
  weaknesses:
  - Text overlap between MATLAB/Swift and Go/Ruby reduces readability
  - Minimal use of seaborn features - essentially a matplotlib implementation wrapped
    in seaborn styling
  - Font size (16pt) could be larger for the text labels since they ARE the data elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot using text labels instead of
    traditional markers, representing 24 programming language names positioned in
    a 2D t-SNE-style dimensionality reduction space. Each language name is rendered
    in a distinct color (Python in blue, JavaScript in yellow, Java in green, etc.)
    with bold 16pt font at alpha=0.85. The plot spans approximately from -4 to 4 on
    both axes with "Dimension 1 (t-SNE)" as the x-axis label and "Dimension 2 (t-SNE)"
    as the y-axis label. The title correctly follows the format "scatter-text · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed grid with alpha=0.3 provides visual reference.
    Languages appear loosely clustered: systems languages (Go, Ruby, C++) on the left,
    scripting languages (Perl, Clojure, Haskell) on the right-lower area. There is
    visible overlap between "MATLAB" and "Swift" labels in the upper-center region,
    and between "Go" and "Ruby" on the left side.'
