review:
  strengths:
  - Clean bimodal data that clearly demonstrates clustering and gaps in distributions
  - Correct use of Bokeh segment glyph for rug ticks with ColumnDataSource
  - Appropriate use of semi-transparency (alpha 0.6) for overlapping observations
  - Good code structure following KISS principles with proper seeding
  - Correct title format and hidden y-axis for clean rug appearance
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs appropriately for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Rug ticks are too tall (spanning ~50% of visible area) - should be small marginal
    marks, not dominant vertical lines
  - 'X-axis label mismatch: code sets Response Time (ms) but image shows Value'
  - Ticks should be positioned at the bottom margin of the plot, not floating in the
    middle of the canvas
