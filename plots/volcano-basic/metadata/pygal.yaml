review:
  strengths:
  - Clean three-category color coding (gray/red/blue) clearly distinguishes significance
    groups
  - Good use of pygal custom Style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Realistic gene expression data scenario with proper statistical distributions
  - Tooltips include gene names for interactivity in HTML output
  - Proper scientific notation in axis labels (subscript formatting)
  weaknesses:
  - Threshold lines (horizontal at p=0.05, vertical at FC=±2) are not visible in the
    rendered output despite being coded
  - Y-axis range extends to -5 when all data is positive (0 to ~4), wasting half the
    vertical canvas
  - Legend positioned in top-left corner instead of near the data or at bottom as
    configured
  - Red/blue color scheme is not colorblind-safe; consider using colorblind-friendly
    palette
