review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color choice
  - Data scenario (website traffic) is realistic and demonstrates the filled line
    concept well
  - Clean KISS code structure following all conventions
  - 'Properly implements all spec requirements: semi-transparent fill, visible line,
    matching colors, y=0 baseline'
  - Weekly cyclical pattern with upward trend makes the visualization interesting
    and informative
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units for full VQ-06 points (e.g., Website Visitors
    (count) or Day (number))
  - Data could show more variety (e.g., a notable spike or dip for a special event)
    to demonstrate range of values better
  - Fill is done with matplotlib fill_between rather than a seaborn-native approach
