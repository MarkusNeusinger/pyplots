review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of raincloud plot advantage over boxplots by including
    a bimodal distribution in Treatment B
  - Perfect specification compliance with correct cloud/boxplot/rain layout (cloud
    on right, rain on left)
  - Realistic experimental psychology data with appropriate reaction time values
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Legend slightly overlaps with Treatment B cloud area in upper right
  - Manual vertex manipulation for half-violin clipping is fragile and library-implementation-dependent
  - Could use ptitprince or native seaborn half-violin parameters instead of manual
    clipping
