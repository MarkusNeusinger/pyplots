  strengths:
  - Correct ECDF step function implementation with proper horizontal-then-vertical
    step pattern
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt ticks)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output, leveraging Bokeh web capabilities
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that aid percentile reading without being distracting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or more descriptive context (e.g., Measurement Value or
    domain-specific label)
  - Data scenario is generic normal distribution rather than a real-world application
    example
  - Could add hover tooltips to show exact percentile values, which is a key Bokeh
    strength
  image_description: The plot displays a classic ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) step function rendered in blue (#306998). The x-axis is labeled "Value"
    ranging from approximately 10 to 90, and the y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion"
    ranging from 0 to 1. The title "ecdf-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the
    top-left corner. The step function shows the characteristic S-curve shape of a
    normal distribution, starting near 0 at low values and approaching 1 at high values.
    The grid lines are subtle and dashed. The plot uses proper step-wise increments,
    clearly showing each data point as a horizontal step followed by a vertical rise.

          HTML for interactivity, but could leverage more Bokeh-specific features
          like hover tools
  verdict: APPROVED
