review:
  strengths:
  - LOWESS curve is visually distinct from scatter points with good color contrast
    (blue vs yellow)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper use of statsmodels
    for LOWESS calculation
  - Custom pygal Style properly configured for large canvas with appropriate font
    sizes
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.6) for scatter points to show density
  - Appropriate LOWESS smoothing parameter (frac=0.35) within recommended range
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels in rendered output are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than the
    domain-specific labels defined in the code
  - Legend entries in output differ from code-defined labels
