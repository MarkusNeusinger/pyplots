review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of quiver plot using Bokeh segment and patches primitives
    since Bokeh lacks a native quiver function
  - Clean circular rotation pattern (u=-y, v=x) demonstrates vector field concept
    effectively
  - Proper arrowhead geometry calculation with perpendicular vectors
  - Good arrow spacing on 15x15 grid prevents overlap
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labels
  - Well-structured KISS code following project guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Arrows are normalized to uniform length, losing magnitude information (spec says
    length proportional to magnitude)
  - Grid lines almost invisible due to alpha and dashes combination
  - Axis labels lack units
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 grid of blue arrows arranged on a white
    background, clearly showing a circular rotation vector field pattern (u = -y,
    v = x). The arrows rotate counterclockwise around the origin at (0,0). The title
    "quiver-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner in gray text.
    The X-axis is labeled "X Position" and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Position", both
    ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5. Arrows are uniformly sized (normalized)
    with Python Blue color (#306998). The grid lines are very subtle (barely visible).
    The arrows have proper triangular arrowheads pointing in the direction of the
    vector field. The layout utilizes the full canvas well with good spacing between
    arrows.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, segment, and patches for custom arrow rendering.
          This is good use of Bokeh's low-level drawing primitives, though doesn't
          leverage Bokeh-specific interactive features.
  verdict: APPROVED
