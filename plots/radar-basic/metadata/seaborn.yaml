review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and appropriate use
    of the colorblind palette
  - 'Perfect implementation of all spec requirements: filled polygons with alpha 0.25,
    gridlines at correct intervals, closed polygons connecting back to first point'
  - Realistic employee performance comparison scenario that matches spec applications
  - Good use of seaborn styling (set_theme with poster context) to achieve proper
    scaling
  - Square aspect ratio is appropriate for radar charts, canvas well-utilized
  weaknesses:
  - Radar charts lack units notation - could add "(Score 0-100)" in subtitle or annotation
  - The two employee profiles could show more contrasting values to better demonstrate
    radar chart comparison capability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/spider chart comparing two employees
    (Senior Developer in blue, Team Lead in yellow/gold) across 6 competency dimensions:
    Technical Skills, Communication, Creativity, Problem Solving, Leadership, and
    Teamwork. The chart uses a polar coordinate system with concentric gridlines at
    20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. Both series are shown as filled polygons with transparency
    (~0.25 alpha), allowing overlap visibility. Data points are marked with circular
    markers at each vertex. The title "radar-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold black text. A legend in the upper right corner identifies the
    two series. The chart uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with good canvas utilization.
    Category labels are positioned at the outer edge of each axis and are clearly
    readable.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme() and sns.scatterplot() for data points, plus
          colorblind palette. However, radar charts are not a seaborn specialty -
          the implementation correctly falls back to matplotlib polar projection for
          the core chart while leveraging seaborn for styling and the data point markers
  verdict: APPROVED
