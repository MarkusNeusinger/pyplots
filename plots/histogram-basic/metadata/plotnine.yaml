review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing following library guidelines (title 24pt, axis titles 20pt,
    tick labels 16pt)
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation with proper layering
  - Good use of theme_minimal for a clean, professional appearance
  - Appropriate bin count (25) for 500 data points - reveals distribution shape without
    noise
  - White bar borders provide clear visual separation between bins
  - Realistic test score scenario that is immediately understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Test Score (points)" or "Frequency (count)")
  - Data extends beyond 100 which is atypical for test scores on a 0-100 scale
  - Distribution is purely symmetric normal - could show more interesting features
    like slight skewness
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram showing the distribution of test
    scores. The bars are filled with a blue color (#306998) with white borders, using
    an alpha of 0.85 for slight transparency. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score" ranging
    from approximately 30 to 115, and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency" ranging from
    0 to about 62. The title "histogram-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. The distribution shows a classic bell curve (normal distribution) centered
    around 70, with the peak frequency around 62 occurrences. The plot uses a minimal
    theme with a clean white background and subtle grid lines. The 16:9 aspect ratio
    provides good horizontal space for the histogram bars.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_histogram and theme_minimal, but could
          leverage more plotnine-specific features like faceting or statistical transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
