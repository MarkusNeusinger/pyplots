review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of clinical trial scenario with dose-response relationship that
    tells a compelling story
  - Median markers (diamond shapes) add statistical context as recommended in spec
  - Good jitter implementation that spreads points horizontally without vertical displacement
  - Proper categorical ordering maintained (Placebo → Low → Medium → High Dose)
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently visible but acceptable)
