review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent waterfall chart structure with proper floating bars and connector lines
  - Clear color coding distinguishes increases (green), decreases (red), and totals
    (blue)
  - Value labels are well-positioned and formatted (totals show full amount, changes
    show +/- prefix)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of geom_rect for precise bar positioning
  - Good financial scenario demonstrating all waterfall features
  weaknesses:
  - No gridlines present - subtle horizontal gridlines would help readers estimate
    values between labeled ticks
  - Could use more distinct colorblind-safe palette (e.g., blue/orange instead of
    green/red)
