review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution for a plot type Altair does not natively support
  - Custom marching squares algorithm implementation for generating contour line segments
  - Effective use of layered marks (rect for filled background + rule for contour
    lines)
  - Viridis colormap with white contour lines creates beautiful contrast
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate sizing
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context
  image_description: The plot displays a contour visualization of two overlapping
    Gaussian peaks on a 2D scalar field. The filled background uses the viridis colormap
    (purple for low values ~0.1 transitioning through green/cyan to yellow for peak
    values ~1.0). White contour lines are clearly overlaid showing isolines at multiple
    levels. The primary peak is centered around (1, 1) with bright yellow at its center,
    while a secondary smaller peak is visible around (-1, -0.5). The title "contour-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. Axis labels show "X Value" (horizontal)
    and "Y Value" (vertical) with tick marks from -3.0 to 3.0. A colorbar on the right
    displays "Z Value" scale from ~0.1 to 1.0. The overall layout is balanced with
    no overlapping elements.

        comment: Creative implementation using marching squares algorithm for contour
          lines and rect marks for filled background. Altair doesn't have native contour
          support, so this demonstrates clever use of available primitives.
  verdict: APPROVED
