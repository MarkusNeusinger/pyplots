review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three MACD components (histogram, MACD line, signal
    line)
  - Clear zero reference line with label for identifying crossover signals
  - Good subtitle showing MACD parameters (12, 26, 9) as required by spec
  - 'Proper color coding: green for positive histogram, red for negative'
  - Clean data generation with proper EMA calculations
  - Interactive HTML output also generated
  - Good use of dashed line style for signal line to distinguish from MACD line
  weaknesses:
  - Uses red-green color combination for histogram bars which is not colorblind-safe;
    consider using blue/orange or other accessible palette
  - X-axis Date label appears slightly cut off at the bottom of the image
  - Implementation uses manual JavaScript/JSON construction rather than the highcharts_core
    Python library API
  image_description: 'The plot displays a MACD technical indicator chart with three
    components: histogram bars (green for positive, red for negative values), a solid
    blue MACD line, and a dashed yellow/orange signal line. The chart spans from Feb
    19 to Jul 08 on the x-axis (datetime) and MACD values from approximately -3.60
    to 2.20 on the y-axis. A prominent zero reference line is visible with a "Zero
    Line" label on the right side. The title "indicator-macd · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top, with a subtitle showing "MACD (12, 26, 9) - Simulated Stock
    Data". A legend in the top area shows all three series. The histogram bars effectively
    show momentum changes, with green bars above zero and red bars below. The MACD
    and signal line crossovers are clearly visible, demonstrating the indicator''s
    purpose for identifying trend reversals.'
