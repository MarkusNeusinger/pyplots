review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all four spec requirements (median, outliers, whiskers,
    colors) implemented perfectly'
  - Strong data generation with varied distributions showing different spreads, medians,
    and deliberate outlier injection for Sales
  - Idiomatic plotnine usage with proper grammar-of-graphics layering and pd.Categorical
    ordering
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed unnecessary gridlines, subtle axis styling,
    appropriate alpha on outliers'
  - All font sizes explicitly set matching library guidelines exactly
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: no annotations highlighting the salary gap between departments,
    no callouts to the Sales outlier cluster, no contextual insight for the reader'
  - Outlier points could be slightly larger or more distinctly colored for better
    emphasis
  - coord_cartesian y-range extends to 155k but data maxes around 145k, creating some
    dead space at top
  - Library mastery is generic — no distinctive plotnine features beyond standard
    grammar-of-graphics patterns
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box-and-whisker chart of salary distributions
    across five departments: Support, Marketing, Sales, Research, and Engineering,
    ordered from lowest to highest median salary. Each department box is colored differently
    using the Set2 qualitative palette — teal (Support), salmon/orange (Marketing),
    lavender/blue (Sales), pink (Research), and yellow-green (Engineering). The y-axis
    is labeled "Salary ($)" ranging from approximately 30,000 to 160,000. The x-axis
    is labeled "Department." The title "box-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears
    in bold at the top. Median lines are clearly visible within each box. Outliers
    appear as gray dots: Support has one high outlier near $80k, Sales has a notable
    cluster of 5-6 outliers between $125k-$140k, and Engineering has one outlier near
    $128k. The background is clean with a minimal theme, subtle horizontal gridlines,
    and no vertical gridlines. No legend is shown since colors correspond directly
    to x-axis labels.'
