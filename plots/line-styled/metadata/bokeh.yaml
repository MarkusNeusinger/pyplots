review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for the 4800×2700 canvas with 48pt title and 36pt axis labels
  - All four line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot) are clearly distinguishable
    as required by spec
  - Clean code structure with well-organized ColumnDataSource
  - Good use of markers on data points to enhance visibility
  - Legend is well-formatted with appropriate sizing and semi-transparent background
  weaknesses:
  - Grid uses dashed style which can visually compete with the dashed line series
    - consider solid grid with lower alpha
  - Could add HoverTool for interactivity to better leverage Bokeh's strengths
  - Data scenario is somewhat generic - Monthly performance metrics could be more
    specific
  image_description: 'The plot displays four line series representing system performance
    metrics (CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Disk I/O, and Network Traffic) over 12 months
    (Jan-Dec). The title "line-styled · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    Each series uses a distinct color: blue (solid) for CPU, yellow (dashed) for Memory,
    green (dotted) for Disk I/O, and orange (dash-dot) for Network Traffic. All lines
    have circular markers at data points. The legend is positioned in the top-left
    inside the plot area with a white background. The Y-axis shows "Utilization (%)"
    ranging from ~60-90, and the X-axis shows month abbreviations. Grid lines are
    subtle and dashed. The background is a light gray (#fafafa).'
