review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of the drilldown concept with side-by-side charts
  - Creative use of FancyArrowPatch to show drill-down relationship
  - Well-designed breadcrumb navigation indicator with styled box
  - Good color consistency using blue palette for related hierarchical data
  - Proper use of explode parameter to highlight selected slice
  - Clear labels with both percentages inside and names/values outside
  weaknesses:
  - Only shows 2 hierarchy levels while spec mentions 2-4 levels would be ideal for
    demonstrating the concept
  - The percentage text inside slices could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - No visual indicator on the main chart slices suggesting they are clickable (spec
    mentions cursor change or icon)
