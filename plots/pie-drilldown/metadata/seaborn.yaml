review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent conceptual representation of drilldown functionality using side-by-side
    pie charts
  - Clear visual hierarchy with exploded slice indicating selection and connecting
    arrow showing drill flow
  - 'Professional UI elements: breadcrumb trail, back button, click indicator annotation'
  - Colorblind-accessible palette choices (colorblind for main, Blues sequential for
    drill)
  - Realistic business data scenario with sales by region and product category
  - Good title format and explanatory subtitle acknowledging static nature
  weaknesses:
  - Missing np.random.seed(42) for reproducibility (even with deterministic data,
    should be included for consistency)
  - Seaborn is primarily used for theming rather than plotting since seaborn lacks
    native pie chart support
  - Small slice labels (Books 5.6%, Sports 10%) could use better positioning to avoid
    crowding
  - Asia Pacific label position slightly overlaps with the connecting arrow area
