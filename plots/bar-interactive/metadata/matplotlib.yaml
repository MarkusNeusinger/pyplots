review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent static representation of interactivity concepts for matplotlib
  - High-quality tooltip annotation with proper styling (rounded box, arrow, multi-line
    content)
  - Smart use of color differentiation to show hover state
  - Professional formatting with currency values and percentage calculations
  - Clean, readable code with good use of matplotlib annotation system
  - Glow effect using Rectangle patch adds visual polish to the highlighted bar
  weaknesses:
  - Feature coverage could include additional interactive concepts (e.g., showing
    multiple tooltip states or click feedback visualization)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart with 8 product categories
    (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Automotive, Health)
    on the x-axis and Sales Revenue in dollars on the y-axis ranging from $0K to $100K.
    The bars are rendered in Python Blue (#306998), with the Electronics bar highlighted
    in Python Yellow (#FFD43B) to simulate a hover state. A well-styled tooltip annotation
    box with rounded corners appears above the highlighted bar, connected by an arrow,
    displaying: Category name, Sales value ($87,500), Share percentage (22.4%), Growth
    rate (+3.9%), and a "[Click to drill down]" action hint. Each bar has a bold value
    label on top showing the amount in $K format. A legend in the top-right corner
    distinguishes between "Normal bar" (blue) and "Hovered bar (highlighted)" (yellow).
    The grid is subtle (dashed, y-axis only, alpha=0.3). X-axis labels are slightly
    rotated at 15° for readability. The title follows the required format: "bar-interactive
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
