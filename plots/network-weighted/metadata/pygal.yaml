review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround for pygal's lack of native network graph support using XY
    chart
  - Force-directed layout algorithm implemented from scratch
  - Good regional color coding with meaningful legend
  - Realistic trade network data with appropriate values
  - Interactive HTML export with embedded SVG
  weaknesses:
  - Edge thickness variation not visible - all edges appear same width despite being
    the spec's key requirement
  - Legend missing $335-495B (high) weight category
  - Node labels (country codes) not visible on the plot itself - only in tooltips
  - Weighted degree node sizing mentioned in code but not visually apparent
  image_description: 'The plot displays a weighted network graph representing international
    trade flows between 13 countries. Nodes are rendered as large colored dots positioned
    using a force-directed layout: blue nodes represent Americas (USA, CAN, MEX, BRA),
    black nodes represent Europe (DEU, FRA, GBR, ITA), yellow nodes represent Asia
    (CHN, JPN, KOR, IND), and a single red node represents Oceania (AUS). Edges connect
    nodes as gray lines of varying shades - lighter gray for lower trade volumes ($20-175B),
    progressively darker gray for higher volumes ($495-650B). The title "network-weighted
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom shows 8 categories:
    4 edge weight ranges and 4 regional node colors. The network shows China (yellow,
    center-right) as a major hub with many connections, and strong USA trade links
    visible. However, the legend is missing the "$335-495B (high)" category, and edges
    all appear with the same stroke width despite the specification requiring edge
    thickness to represent weight.'
