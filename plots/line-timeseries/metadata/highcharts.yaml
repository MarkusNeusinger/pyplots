review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature pattern with realistic daily variation demonstrates
    time series data well
  - Smart date formatting with monthly tick intervals prevents label overlap
  - High-resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts and line width
  - Correct title format and proper axis labels with units
  - Clean use of Highcharts datetime axis with millisecond timestamps
  - Subtitle adds context about the data
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area instead of highcharts_core.options.series.line
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like zooming capability or data
    grouping for large datasets
