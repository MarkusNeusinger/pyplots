review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highmaps tiledwebmap for OpenStreetMap basemap integration
  - Good implementation of kernel smoothing for continuous density effect
  - Sequential YlOrRd colormap with transparency allows basemap visibility
  - Clean geographic projection setup with WebMercator
  - Multiple realistic hotspots demonstrating density variations
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a function definition (gaussian_smooth) which violates KISS structure
    guideline
  - Subtitle text appears quite small relative to the canvas size
  image_description: The plot displays a geographic heatmap of the San Francisco Bay
    Area overlaid on OpenStreetMap tiles. The visualization shows activity density
    using a sequential yellow-orange-red colormap with transparency, allowing the
    basemap to show through. Multiple density hotspots are visible around the SF peninsula
    and East Bay (Oakland/Berkeley area), rendered as semi-transparent colored squares
    that create a smooth heatmap effect. The title "Activity Density in SF Bay Area
    · heatmap-geographic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, with a subtitle
    "Spatial density visualization using kernel smoothing". A vertical intensity legend
    on the right shows the scale from 0.0 to 1.0. The basemap provides excellent geographic
    context with coastlines, city labels, roads, and terrain coloring.
