  strengths:
  - Excellent isometric projection implementation with proper rotation angles and
    depth-based sizing (painter's algorithm)
  - Floor grid provides outstanding depth perception and spatial context
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate 3D spatial relationships and clustering
    patterns
  - Color encoding via viridis for altitude adds informative fourth dimension
  - Interactive tooltips showing Altitude and Depth values enhance the HTML output
  - Clean code structure with well-commented sections
  weaknesses:
  - Library features score is moderate since lets-plot lacks native 3D support and
    the projection is manually implemented
  - Realistic context could be more specific (e.g., meteorological sensors or geological
    survey points)
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D scatter plot rendered as a 2D isometric
    projection. Three distinct clusters of points are visible, each colored according
    to altitude (z-value) using the viridis colormap ranging from purple (low, ~0m)
    to yellow (high, ~4m). The upper-left cluster shows yellow/green points at higher
    altitudes. The lower-left cluster displays purple points at lower altitudes. The
    right-center cluster shows cyan/teal points at intermediate altitudes. A floor
    grid provides depth perception, and three axis lines (X, Y, Z) emanate from the
    origin with bold labels. The title "scatter-3d · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. Axis labels read "Projected X (m)" and "Projected Y (m)". The legend
    shows "Altitude (m)" with the viridis color scale.

        comment: Points are visible with good alpha (0.75), but some overlapping in
          the dense right-center cluster; size variation based on depth is a nice

        comment: Grid is appropriately subtle, but the standard axis grid lines are
          removed (panel_grid=element_blank()) while only the floor grid remains;
          legend is well-placed

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, viridis scale, layer_tooltips for interactivity,
          but the 3D projection is custom math rather than a lets-plot feature; no
          native 3D support utilized
  verdict: APPROVED
