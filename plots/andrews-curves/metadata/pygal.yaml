quality_score: 88
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue/orange/purple)
  - Proper data normalization (z-score standardization) as recommended in spec
  - Interactive tooltips showing original iris measurements for each curve
  - Clean legend with only 3 entries (one per species) rather than per-curve
  - Correct Andrews curve formula implementation
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for large canvas sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha/opacity could be reduced)
  - Some individual curves are hard to trace due to overlapping in the middle region
