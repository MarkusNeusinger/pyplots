review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent candlestick implementation using geom_segment for wicks and geom_rect
    for bodies
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good visual clarity with appropriately sized elements and well-spaced date labels
  - Realistic stock price simulation with random walk algorithm
  - Correct title format and proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme may cause issues for colorblind users; consider using blue/orange
    or adding patterns
  - X-axis label Date could be more descriptive (e.g., Trading Date or include year)
  - Grid only shows horizontal lines; subtle vertical gridlines at date markers could
    help readability
