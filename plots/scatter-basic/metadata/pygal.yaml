review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-calibrated font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Correct use of pygal.XY with stroke=False for scatter plot behavior
  - Proper implementation of transparency (opacity=0.7) as specified
  - Excellent code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct title format matching the specification
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (generic X Value, Y Value)
  - Dot size could be slightly larger for better visibility at 100 data points
  - Data is generic random correlation rather than a realistic scenario
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter visualization with approximately
    100 blue data points (#306998 Python Blue) on a clean white background. The title
    "scatter-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a readable font. The
    X-axis is labeled "X Value" (range ~5-13) and Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" (range
    ~3-14). Data points show a clear positive correlation pattern with appropriate
    scatter/noise. Subtle dashed grid lines are present on both axes. The dots have
    good visibility with apparent transparency for overlapping points. Layout uses
    16:9 aspect ratio (4800×2700).

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are all clearly readable. Font
          sizes are well-calibrated for the 4800×2700 canvas.

        comment: Dots are visible and appropriately sized (dots_size=12). For 100
          points, this is reasonable though slightly on the smaller side.

        comment: Good proportions overall, though there's slightly more whitespace
          on the left side due to data distribution.

        comment: Grid is subtle with dashed lines, no legend needed for single series
          (correctly hidden).

        comment: Uses pygal.XY for scatter, custom Style configuration, SVG-native
          output with PNG export. Could leverage more pygal-specific features like
          tooltips or value formatting.
  verdict: APPROVED
