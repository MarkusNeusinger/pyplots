review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical organization with group headers and indented task names
  - Dependency arrows are well-styled with curved paths and appropriate opacity
  - Color scheme is distinctive and colorblind-accessible
  - Aggregate phase bars provide good visual summary
  - Clean title format and professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - The implementation relies heavily on matplotlib for actual plotting logic; seaborn
    is mainly used for styling and the lineplot hack for bars
  - Some dependency arrows pass through task bars rather than routing around them
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart with task dependencies for a
    software development project. The chart shows 15 tasks organized into 4 phases:
    Requirements (dark blue), Design (yellow/gold), Development (light blue), and
    Testing (olive green). Each phase has a semi-transparent aggregate bar showing
    the overall phase duration, with individual tasks displayed as thicker bars below
    their respective phase headers. The y-axis lists tasks with bullet markers (▪)
    for group headers and indented task names. The x-axis shows dates from Jan 01
    to May 20, with tick marks every 2 weeks. Curved gray dependency arrows connect
    related tasks showing finish-to-start relationships. A legend in the upper right
    explains the color coding for project phases and the dependency arrow style. The
    title follows the correct format: "gantt-dependencies · seaborn · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with units parameter creatively for Gantt bars,
          sns.set_theme for styling, and sns.despine; however, Gantt charts are not
          a native seaborn feature so this is more of a matplotlib-heavy implementation
