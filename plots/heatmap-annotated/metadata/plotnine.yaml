review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of contrasting text colors based on background intensity
    using scale_color_identity
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_tile + geom_text)
  - Good choice of RdBu diverging palette for correlation data with appropriate limits
    (-1, 1)
  - Proper categorical ordering to maintain consistent variable arrangement
  - Well-formatted annotations with 2 decimal places as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Variable / Variable) - could be more descriptive like
    Economic Indicator
  - Figure size is 12x12 at 300dpi - library guidelines suggest 16x9 landscape as
    default
  - Library features score is modest - implementation works but does not showcase
    unique plotnine capabilities
