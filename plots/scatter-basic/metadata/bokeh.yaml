review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-distinctive features: Band glyph for confidence band,
    Slope model for trend line, Label model for annotations — showcasing what makes
    Bokeh unique'
  - Strong data storytelling with R² statistic, confidence band, and explanatory subtitle
    guiding the viewer interpretation
  - 'Publication-quality visual refinement: removed axis lines/ticks, subtle grid,
    custom background, white marker edges for definition'
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (study hours vs exam scores) with intentional outliers
    that demonstrate scatter plot features
  - All font sizes explicitly calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas, ensuring perfect
    readability
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size (45) is slightly large for 100 points, causing mild visual crowding
    in the upper-right cluster — reducing to ~35 would improve clarity
  - Subtitle text at 36pt could be slightly more prominent or repositioned as it blends
    into the background with gray color and 0.7 alpha
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot titled "scatter-basic · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" at the top in large bold text. Blue circular markers (#306998 Python
    Blue) with white edge outlines are plotted on a Cartesian grid showing Study Hours
    (hrs) on the x-axis (range 0–11) versus Exam Score (%) on the y-axis (range 10–100).
    A dashed blue trend line with positive slope runs through the data, surrounded
    by a light blue semi-transparent confidence band (±1.5σ). An italic blue annotation
    "R² = 0.730" is positioned in the upper-left area, with a gray subtitle below
    it reading "Positive correlation with natural outliers — shaded region shows ±1.5σ".
    The background is a very light gray (#FAFAFA) with subtle grid lines (alpha 0.15).
    Axis lines and tick marks are removed for a clean aesthetic. Outliers are clearly
    visible — notably a point at ~5.5 hours scoring ~30 and a point at ~9 hours scoring
    ~42. Points at ~2.5 hours scoring ~95 and ~3.5 hours scoring ~91 also stand out
    as high-performing outliers. The overall layout is well-balanced with the plot
    filling most of the 4800×2700 canvas.
