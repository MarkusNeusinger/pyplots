review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the slope chart concept with clear visual distinction
    between increasing and decreasing trends
  - Labels at both endpoints follow the spec requirement perfectly with product names
    and values
  - Color coding (blue for increase, yellow for decrease) is intuitive and colorblind-accessible
  - Good use of Bokeh Label model for precise text positioning
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with readable fonts
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool for interactive exploration of exact values when viewing HTML
    version
  - Label text could be slightly larger (20pt instead of 18pt) for optimal readability
    at the target resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a slope chart comparing 10 products'' sales
    between Q1 and Q4. Blue lines (Python Blue #306998) indicate products with increased
    sales, while yellow/gold lines (Python Yellow #FFD43B) indicate decreased sales.
    Each product has labels at both endpoints showing the product name and value (e.g.,
    "Product A: 85" on the left, "92: Product A" on the right). The time points "Q1"
    and "Q4" appear at the bottom. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands)" with
    values ranging from ~30 to 100. The title "slope-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top. The chart effectively shows the direction and magnitude of
    change for each product.'

        comment: All text is readable at full size. Title at 32pt, axis labels at
          22pt, tick labels at 18pt, endpoint labels at 18pt. Slightly smaller than
          ideal for some elements.

        passed: true
        comment: Minor potential for overlap when values are close (e.g., Products
          B and G at Q1 are at 72 and 78), but generally well-spaced.

        comment: Lines are 4px wide with 0.8 alpha, markers are size 18 - excellent
          visibility for 10 entities.

        score: 4

        passed: true
        comment: Blue/yellow is colorblind-safe (not red-green), good contrast. Could
          be slightly better with a third distinct color for no-change scenario.

        comment: Good use of canvas, plot is well-centered with appropriate margins
          for labels.

        score: 1
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: Y-axis has "Sales (thousands)" which is descriptive with units. X-axis
          uses custom labels via Labels, which is appropriate for this chart type.

        passed: true
        comment: Subtle dashed grid with 0.3 alpha, no legend needed as colors are
          self-explanatory via line direction.

        comment: Uses Bokeh's Label model for custom positioning, figure for plotting,
          and both PNG export and HTML save for interactivity. Could leverage more
          Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool for interactivity.
