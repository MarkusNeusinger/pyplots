quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast implementation using conditional color encoding for annotations
  - Professional diverging colormap (blueorange) appropriate for correlation data
  - Well-structured data generation creating realistic business metric correlations
  - Clean layered approach combining heatmap rectangles with text overlay
  - High-quality formatting with proper number formatting (.2f for correlations)
  weaknesses:
  - Limited demonstration of negative correlations (only -0.24 appears)
  - Axis label "Variable" is generic; could be more descriptive given the business
    context
  - Does not utilize Altair interactive features (tooltips) in the HTML output
  - Canvas utilization could be improved with slightly larger margins
