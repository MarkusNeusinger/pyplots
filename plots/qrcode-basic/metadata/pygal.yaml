review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative use of pygal SVG capabilities to render QR codes by extending
    the Graph class
  - Clean visual presentation with proper QR code structure including finder patterns
    and quiet zone
  - Informative labels showing encoded URL, error correction level, and matrix dimensions
  - High contrast black/white for maximum scannability
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML formats
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a custom class (QRCodeChart) which violates the KISS principle of no
    functions/classes
  - Requires path manipulation hack to avoid import collision
  image_description: 'The plot displays a QR code on a white background with the title
    "qrcode-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The QR code itself is a 25x25
    module matrix rendered in black squares on a white background with a subtle gray
    border around it. The three finder patterns (large squares with nested squares)
    are visible in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left corners as required by
    the QR code specification. Below the QR code, there are three lines of text: "https://pyplots.ai"
    in blue/Python blue color (#306998), "Error Correction: M (15%)" in gray, and
    "Matrix: 25 x 25 modules" also in gray. The QR code is well-centered and takes
    up a good portion of the square canvas. The quiet zone (white border) around the
    QR code is properly maintained.'
