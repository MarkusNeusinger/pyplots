review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent raincloud metaphor: cloud (half-violin) rises above, boxplot centered,
    rain (points) falls below each category — perfectly matches the specification'
  - Bimodal Treatment B data brilliantly demonstrates why raincloud plots are superior
    to boxplots for revealing hidden distribution structure
  - Sophisticated use of plotnine stage() function with after_scale for precise component
    positioning — an idiomatic and elegant approach
  - Clean, well-organized code that follows KISS principles with appropriate comments
    explaining the coord_flip logic
  - Perfect spec compliance on all 15 points including orientation, jitter range,
    alpha, and title format
  weaknesses:
  - No annotations or storytelling elements to highlight the key insight — the bimodal
    distribution in Treatment B is the most interesting feature but goes uncalled-out
  - Point size (1.8) is on the small side; slightly larger points would improve individual
    data point visibility
  - Visual design is good but not editorial/publication-grade — could benefit from
    more sophisticated color harmony or subtle design touches
  - Vertical spacing between category groups is slightly generous, leaving some canvas
    underutilized
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction Time
    (ms) on the x-axis ranging from ~280 to 600. Each condition features three layered
    components: a half-violin density curve (cloud) extending upward from the category
    baseline, a narrow white boxplot centered on the baseline showing median and quartiles,
    and jittered individual data points (rain) scattered below the baseline. Colors
    are blue (#306998) for Control, yellow (#FFD43B) for Treatment A, and green (#5BA85B)
    for Treatment B. The Control distribution centers around 450ms with a unimodal
    shape, Treatment A centers around 380ms (also unimodal), and Treatment B shows
    a clearly bimodal distribution with peaks around 350ms and 500ms. The title reads
    "raincloud-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The background is minimal with light
    gray vertical grid lines and no y-axis grid. No legend is shown since categories
    are labeled directly on the y-axis.'
