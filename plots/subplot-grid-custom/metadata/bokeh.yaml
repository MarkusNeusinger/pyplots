review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard-style layout demonstrating non-uniform subplot sizes with
    larger main chart and smaller detail panels
  - Consistent visual styling across all subplots with matching font sizes, grid alpha,
    and outline styling
  - Realistic financial dashboard scenario with coherent data story (price, volume,
    returns analysis)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper use of ColumnDataSource for all data
  - Good color palette using Python blue/yellow theme with accent colors for variety
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom row panels have slight width inconsistency (1500+1500+1600 vs top row)
    creating minor visual imbalance
  - Does not demonstrate rowspan (tall sidebar plot) which is mentioned in the spec
    notes
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific interactive features like linked brushing or
    hover tooltips
