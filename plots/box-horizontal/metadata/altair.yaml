review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with 6 service types showing varied distributions, outliers,
    and realistic response time ranges
  - Categories sorted by median value for easier comparison as recommended in spec
  - Clean implementation with proper Altair encoding types (Q for quantitative, N
    for nominal)
  - Good customization of box plot components (box color, median color, outlier styling)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines which could help readers trace values across the wide x-axis
  - Could leverage Altair interactive() method for tooltip exploration in the HTML
    output
  - Slight excess whitespace on right side due to outlier-extended scale
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response time
    distributions for 6 different service types. The boxes are rendered in a blue
    color (#306998) with yellow median lines. Services are displayed on the y-axis
    (Cache Lookup, Authentication, API Gateway, Database Query, Email Service, File
    Storage) sorted by median value from fastest to slowest. The x-axis shows "Response
    Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to ~500ms. Each service shows a box representing the
    IQR, whiskers extending to the data range, and circular outlier points. The title
    "box-horizontal · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The layout is
    clean with no overlapping elements, and outliers are clearly visible for each
    service category.
