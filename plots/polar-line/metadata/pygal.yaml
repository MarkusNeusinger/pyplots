review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of monthly temperature data demonstrating cyclical patterns perfectly
    suited for polar visualization
  - Strong color contrast between blue and yellow series that is colorblind-accessible
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized custom styling
  - Good use of pygal Radar chart features including inner_radius for visual appeal
  - Title follows exact specification format
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis title or label indicating units (radial axis should show Temperature
    in °C)
  - Dot markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Could showcase additional pygal features like tooltips or value display on hover
