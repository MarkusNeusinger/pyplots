quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of forest plot with proper diamond marker for pooled
    estimate
  - Weight-proportional marker sizing implemented correctly
  - Clean visual design with subtle grid and clear reference line at null effect
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (blue/yellow)
  - X-axis label includes units and CI notation
  - Tooltip shows detailed information (effect size, CI, weight)
  weaknesses:
  - Slight gap between last study and pooled estimate could be tighter
  - Grid/legend score affected by disabled legend (though appropriate for this plot
    type)
  - Code structure has multiple series loops which adds complexity
