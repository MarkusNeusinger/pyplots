review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format, axis labels with units, and
    all required features
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed and idiomatic seaborn API usage
  - 'Good visual refinement: despine, subtle dashed grid, white marker edges, appropriate
    alpha'
  - Realistic education context with plausible data ranges
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: adding a trend/regression line or annotating key insights
    (e.g., correlation coefficient, outlier callout) would guide the viewer'
  - Marker size s=120 is slightly large for 150 data points — reducing to s=80-90
    would reduce clumping in dense regions
  - The design stays within well-configured default territory; a more distinctive
    color treatment, secondary visual element, or stylistic refinement would elevate
    it
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D scatter plot with 150 data points showing
    the relationship between "Study Hours (per week)" on the x-axis (ranging from
    ~1 to 10) and "Exam Score (points)" on the y-axis (ranging from ~10 to 120). All
    markers use a single muted blue color (#306998 Python Blue) with white edge highlights
    and moderate transparency (alpha=0.7). The title "scatter-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in medium-weight font. A clear positive linear correlation
    is visible — students who study more tend to score higher. The top and right spines
    are removed (seaborn despine), and a subtle dashed grid with low opacity aids
    value estimation. The layout is landscape 16:9 with balanced margins and good
    canvas utilization.

        comment: set_theme and despine are seaborn-distinctive but core scatter is
          easily replicable in matplotlib
  verdict: REJECTED
