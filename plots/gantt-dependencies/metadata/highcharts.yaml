review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts Gantt module with native dependency connector support
  - Clear visual representation of task relationships with well-styled arrow connectors
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette for phase differentiation
  - Realistic software development project scenario with meaningful task dependencies
  - Proper HTML export alongside PNG for interactive features
  weaknesses:
  - Python project_data dictionary is defined but not directly used in the chart config
    (JavaScript handles data inline)
  - Missing explicit group headers with aggregate timeline bars as mentioned in spec
  - Some whitespace could be better utilized on the right side of the chart
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Gantt chart showing a software development project schedule with 12 tasks organized across 4 phases: Requirements Phase (blue - 3 tasks), Design Phase (yellow/gold - 3 tasks), Development Phase (purple/magenta - 3 tasks), and Testing Phase (cyan - 3 tasks). The chart spans from January 1, 2024 to March 25, 2024.

    Task bars are displayed as colored horizontal rectangles with task names displayed both on the left Y-axis labels and as white text on the bars themselves. Dependency arrows (gray connector lines) clearly show finish-to-start relationships between tasks, with arrows flowing from the end of predecessor tasks to the start of successor tasks. The arrows include rounded corners and arrow markers at the endpoints.

    The title "gantt-dependencies · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle "Software Development Project Schedule with Task Dependencies". X-axis shows weekly date intervals. A legend at the bottom identifies the four phases by color.
