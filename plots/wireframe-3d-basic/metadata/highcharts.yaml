review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wireframe effect using scatter3d with line connections
  - Two-tone blue color scheme enhances depth perception of the mesh
  - Clear title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  - Mathematical subtitle displaying the function formula
  - All three axes properly labeled with descriptive text and units
  - 'Good 3D viewing angle (alpha: 18, beta: 30) showing surface topology'
  - Proper canvas size (4800x2700) with good utilization
  weaknesses:
  - Z-axis tick labels and axis title overlap slightly in the lower right corner
  - Grid/legend score reduced as no visible gridlines on the 3D frame floor for spatial
    reference
  image_description: 'The plot shows a 3D wireframe visualization of the ripple function
    z = sin(√(x² + y²)). The wireframe mesh is rendered in two shades of blue (#306998
    for X-direction lines and #1e4c73 for Y-direction lines), creating a clear grid
    pattern. The surface shows the characteristic concentric ripple pattern emanating
    from the origin. The plot has three labeled axes: X Position (units) ranging from
    -5 to 5, Y Position (units) ranging from -5 to 5, and Z Amplitude ranging from
    -1.2 to 1.2. The title "wireframe-3d-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top with a subtitle showing the mathematical formula. The 3D perspective
    provides a good viewing angle showing the surface topology. A subtle blue-tinted
    3D frame provides depth context.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts 3D scatter with line connections to simulate wireframe;
          creative workaround for a library that doesn't natively support wireframe
          plots
