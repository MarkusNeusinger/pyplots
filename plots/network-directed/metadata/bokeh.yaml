review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean, readable node labels positioned inside circles with bold text
  - Proper use of Bokeh Arrow and NormalHead for directed edges
  - Well-implemented legend with background box for clarity
  - Realistic software dependency scenario matching spec application
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs leverage Bokeh capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Edge shortening calculations could be improved for more consistent arrow-to-node
    spacing
  - No curved edges for potential bidirectional relationships
  image_description: 'The plot displays a directed network graph showing software
    module dependencies. It uses a circular layout with 12 nodes arranged in a roughly
    circular pattern. Nodes are colored by group: blue for Core Modules (API, Auth,
    Database, Models, Routes, Middleware), yellow for Infrastructure (Cache, Logger,
    Config), teal for Shared Utils (Utils, Validators), and gray for Development (Tests).
    Directed arrows connect the nodes showing import dependencies, pointing from source
    to target. The title "network-directed · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top. A legend in the upper right corner explains the color coding for the
    four module groups. All node labels are clearly readable inside the circles.'
