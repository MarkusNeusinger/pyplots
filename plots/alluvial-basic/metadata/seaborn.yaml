review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colorblind-safe palette
  - Smooth Bezier curves for flow bands create professional appearance
  - Proper use of transparency (alpha=0.35) allows overlapping flows to remain readable
  - Labels on both left and right sides improve readability without a separate legend
  - Title follows exact spec format
  - Realistic election data scenario that clearly demonstrates voter migration patterns
  - Clean white background with no distracting grid elements
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn used only for styling (set_style, set_context) rather than core plotting
    functions - acceptable since seaborn has no native alluvial support
  - No units or scale information displayed on the diagram
