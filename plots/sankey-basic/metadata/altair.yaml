review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of Sankey diagram using Altair primitive marks
    (rectangles + filled polygons)
  - Smooth S-curve interpolation for flow bands using smoothstep function creates
    natural-looking flows
  - Well-organized color scheme with Python Blue (#306998) as primary source color
  - Clean layer composition (links → nodes → source labels → target labels)
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity on node hover
  - Proper title format with informative subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - The three blue shades for Coal, Gas, and Nuclear sources are visually similar;
    wider color variation would improve distinguishability
  - Code complexity is high due to manual polygon generation; this is necessary since
    Altair lacks native Sankey support, but adds maintenance burden
