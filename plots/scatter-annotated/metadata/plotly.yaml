review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual annotation positioning with custom offsets for each company prevents
    label overlap
  - Clean annotation styling with white background boxes, blue borders, and connecting
    arrows
  - Good use of realistic tech company data that makes the plot immediately comprehensible
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided
  weaknesses:
  - Does not fully leverage plotly interactive capabilities as a distinctive feature
    (hover is secondary to static annotations)
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is too subtle and could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3 recommended)
