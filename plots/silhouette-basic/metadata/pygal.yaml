review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of silhouette plot concept using horizontal bars
  - Clear visual separation of clusters with distinct colors (Python blue, Python
    yellow, complementary red)
  - Demonstrates both positive and negative silhouette values effectively
  - Overall average displayed in title and as major x-axis label
  - Good use of custom pygal Style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Legend shows cluster averages which is informative
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (barely visible in the output), making it harder to
    read exact values
  - Bars are quite thin for 150 samples, making individual sample analysis difficult
  - The x_labels_major feature for highlighting average silhouette does not render
    prominently as a visual reference line
  - Cluster average annotations are only in legend/title, not visually marked on the
    plot area itself
