review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with excellent text legibility at target resolution
  - Error bars have visible caps as required by the specification
  - Caption clearly explains what the error bars represent (95% CI)
  - Asymmetric error bars correctly implemented with ymin/ymax
  - Realistic A/B testing scenario with plausible conversion rate data
  - Proper use of ggplot2-style grammar of graphics
  weaknesses:
  - The alternating blue/yellow color scheme is decorative rather than informative;
    colors could encode a meaningful variable
  - Grid could benefit from a subtle alpha setting
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart with 5 vertical bars representing
    A/B test groups: Control, Variant A, Variant B, Variant C, and Variant D. The
    bars alternate between Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) colors. Each
    bar has clearly visible black error bars with horizontal caps at both ends, indicating
    the 95% confidence intervals. The Y-axis is labeled "Conversion Rate (%)" and
    ranges from 0 to 19. The X-axis is labeled "Test Group" with category names below
    each bar. The title "bar-error · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.
    A caption "Error bars show 95% CI" is positioned at the bottom right, explaining
    what the error bars represent. The minimal theme provides a clean look with subtle
    gridlines on the Y-axis only.'
