review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world use case (employee performance review) that demonstrates
    practical application
  - Good colorblind-safe blue/yellow color palette with appropriate transparency for
    overlapping polygons
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - All axis labels clearly positioned and readable at the outer edge
  - Proper polygon closure (connecting last point back to first)
  - Gridlines at spec-recommended intervals (20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
  weaknesses:
  - Limited seaborn-specific features used (only sns.set_theme); implementation is
    essentially matplotlib with seaborn styling
  - Figure size produces correct dimensions but could use slightly larger markers
    and tick labels for the canvas size
  - Legend positioning with bbox_to_anchor could be better integrated into the layout
