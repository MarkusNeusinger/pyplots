review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent collision detection algorithm using Archimedean spiral placement with
    proper padding
  - 'Clean alternating color scheme using Python brand colors (blue #306998, yellow
    #FFD43B)'
  - Proper scaling of font sizes (48pt-160pt) proportional to frequency values
  - Correct title format and positioning
  - No overlapping text despite 35 words
  weaknesses:
  - Word cloud does not fill enough of the 4800x2700 canvas - significant whitespace
    above and below the word cluster
  - Missing Bokeh distinctive interactive features (HoverTool to show word frequencies
    on hover)
  - All words are horizontal - typical word clouds include some rotated words for
    visual interest
  - Color is purely decorative alternating pattern rather than encoding meaningful
    information like word category
