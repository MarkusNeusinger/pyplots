review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of square format (12x12) which is ideal for polar coordinate
    plots
  - Smart use of seasonal temperature data that naturally demonstrates cyclical patterns
  - Clean color scheme with colorblind-safe yellow and blue that provide strong contrast
  - Proper closing of the line loop by appending the first point, creating a complete
    circle
  - Comprehensive radial axis labeling with temperature units (°C)
  - Time-based theta labels that directly relate to the cyclical nature of the data
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement at bbox_to_anchor=(0.95, 0.95) places it slightly outside the
    natural visual flow
  - Could leverage matplotlib fill_between or polar-specific features for enhanced
    visualization
