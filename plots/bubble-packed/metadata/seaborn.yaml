review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent inline circle packing algorithm (fixed KISS violation from previous
    attempt)
  - Now properly uses sns.scatterplot() instead of pure matplotlib patches
  - Smart adaptive labeling based on circle radius with external annotations for small
    circles
  - Clean colorblind-safe Set2 palette with white edge styling
  - Well-structured realistic data showing company market caps by sector
  - Good visual hierarchy with largest companies prominently featured
  weaknesses:
  - Goldman label and bubble partially obscured by legend box in lower right - legend
    position should be adjusted
  - UnitedHealth label appears partially clipped/cramped within its circle bounds
  - Some external annotation arrows for small circles (like Target) are missing in
    the visual output
  - Market cap values are simplified rather than current realistic values
