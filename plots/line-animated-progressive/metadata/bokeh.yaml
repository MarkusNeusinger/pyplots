review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis gradient to show temporal progression on both line and
    markers
  - Comprehensive implementation with both static PNG and interactive HTML with animation
    controls
  - Good marker size progression indicating time (larger = more recent)
  - Clear highlighting of the most recent data point with distinct styling
  - Interactive version includes play/pause, reset, and slider controls for animation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position top_left slightly overlaps with early data points in the upper
    left
  - Some imports (Slider, Button, row, column) are only used in the HTML version,
    making the static code slightly less clean
  image_description: The plot displays a time series of monthly temperature readings
    spanning from January 2019 to late 2023. The visualization uses a Viridis color
    gradient that transitions from dark purple (earliest data points) through blue/teal
    to yellow/green (most recent data points), effectively communicating temporal
    progression. Line segments are colored according to this gradient, and circular
    markers are placed at each data point with sizes increasing over time (larger
    = more recent). The final data point is prominently highlighted with a larger
    yellow marker with a blue border, labeled "Current" in the legend. A vertical
    colorbar on the right side indicates "Time Progression" with values from 0 to
    approximately 59. The seasonal temperature pattern (sinusoidal with ~5 cycles)
    is clearly visible, ranging from approximately 5°C to 27°C. Axis labels show "Date"
    (x-axis) and "Temperature (°C)" (y-axis) with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700
    canvas.
