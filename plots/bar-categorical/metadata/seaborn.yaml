review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.countplot for automatic frequency counting - the core seaborn
    feature for this plot type
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed top/right spines
  - Well-chosen custom color palette with distinct colors for each programming language
  - Count labels on bars enhance readability
  - Properly handles seaborn 0.14+ API by using hue parameter with palette
  weaknesses:
  - Could use seaborn built-in themes (sns.set_theme or sns.set_style) for more distinctive
    seaborn styling
  - The order parameter manually specifies the order rather than computing it from
    the data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing programming language
    preferences from survey responses. Seven bars represent different languages: Python
    (dark blue, 140 responses), JavaScript (golden yellow, 101), Java (steel blue,
    86), C++ (teal, 53), Go (olive/teal, 47), Rust (salmon/peach, 37), and TypeScript
    (medium blue, 36). Each bar has its count displayed above it. The title reads
    "bar-categorical · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. X-axis is labeled "Programming
    Language" and Y-axis "Number of Responses". A subtle dashed grid is present on
    the y-axis. The top and right spines are removed for a cleaner appearance.'

        comment: Uses sns.countplot which is a seaborn-specific function for automatic
          counting, but the implementation could have leveraged more seaborn styling
          features like set_theme() or statistical annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
