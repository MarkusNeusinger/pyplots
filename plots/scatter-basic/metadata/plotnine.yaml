  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with correlation annotation (r=0.92), explanatory
    subtitle, and regression line with confidence interval
  - Publication-quality typography with fully explicit font sizes and intentional
    color hierarchy
  - Idiomatic plotnine usage showcasing grammar of graphics with stat_smooth statistical
    layer
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle with reproducible seed
  - Colorblind-safe blue/orange palette with edge highlighting on markers
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size is slightly large for 150 data points, causing some visual density
    in clustered areas — reducing size from 5 to ~3.5-4 would improve clarity
  - Data shows a purely linear relationship; introducing slight non-linearity or a
    few more pronounced outliers would better showcase scatter plot capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot of 150 data points showing the
    relationship between Study Hours (per week) on the x-axis (range 1-10) and Exam
    Score (points) on the y-axis (range ~20-100). Points are rendered as filled blue
    circles (#306998) with darker blue edges (#1a3a5c) and moderate transparency (alpha
    0.65). An orange linear regression line with a light gray confidence interval
    band runs diagonally from lower-left (~40 at 1 hour) to upper-right (~95 at 10
    hours). In the upper-left corner, an italic annotation reads "r = 0.92" with a
    smaller gray note "Strong positive correlation" below it. The title "scatter-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is bold at the top with a subtitle "More study time correlates
    with higher exam performance." The background is a very light gray (#fafafa) with
    subtle major gridlines. The layout is well-balanced on a 16:9 canvas with good
    margins.
