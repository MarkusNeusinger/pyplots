review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent mosaic layout implementation using CSS Grid with AAB/AAB/CCC pattern
  - Clean visual hierarchy with larger panel A dominating, supporting panels B and
    C
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette across all panels
  - Descriptive axis labels with units
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario
  - Proper title format and overall professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legends in Panel A and C are quite small and could be larger for better visibility
  - Could use Highcharts built-in dashboard/synchronized chart features for more native
    implementation
  image_description: The plot displays a mosaic/dashboard layout with three panels.
    The main title "subplot-mosaic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.
    Panel A (large, spanning upper-left 2x2) shows a line chart of "Monthly Sales
    Trend" with months Jan-Dec on the x-axis and Sales (Units) 38-88 on the y-axis,
    using a blue line with circular markers. Panel B (narrow, upper-right) shows a
    horizontal bar chart "Regional Performance" with four regions (North, South, East,
    West) in colorblind-safe colors (blue, yellow, purple, cyan) with values 245,
    312, 189, 276 respectively. Panel C (wide, bottom spanning full width) displays
    a scatter plot "Product Price vs Revenue Analysis" with Product Price ($) 10-98
    on x-axis and Revenue ($) 0-18k on y-axis, using blue semi-transparent dots. All
    panels have light gray backgrounds with subtle shadows, creating a cohesive dashboard
    appearance. Grid lines are subtle gray.

        comment: Uses Highcharts' native chart types and styling; CSS Grid for layout
          is clever but not Highcharts-specific
  verdict: APPROVED
