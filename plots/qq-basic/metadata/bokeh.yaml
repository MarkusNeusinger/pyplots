review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 resolution with clear legibility at all levels
  - Proper Q-Q plot implementation with correct theoretical quantile calculation using
    Abramowitz & Stegun approximation
  - Good use of Bokeh Slope model for the reference line
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate color scheme with good contrast and accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify what the dashed yellow line represents
  - Data could show more diverse distribution characteristics (heavy tails, outliers)
    to better demonstrate Q-Q plot interpretation
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactivity (hover tooltips showing exact quantile values)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot with blue circular
    markers (color #306998) plotted against a light gray background (#fafafa). The
    x-axis is labeled "Theoretical Quantiles" and the y-axis is labeled "Sample Quantiles",
    both ranging approximately from -2.5 to 2.5. A yellow/gold dashed diagonal reference
    line (y=x) runs from bottom-left to top-right. The title "qq-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears in the top-left corner. The data points generally follow the reference
    line but show slight deviation in the upper-right region (positive quantiles),
    indicating the right-skewed data characteristic from the mixed normal distribution.
    The grid is subtle with dashed lines at alpha 0.3. Overall, the plot has good
    proportions with the chart area well-utilized.'

          capabilities
  verdict: APPROVED
