review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of transparency (alpha=0.5) making overlapping regions clearly visible
  - Consistent bin edges across all groups using np.linspace for accurate comparison
  - Realistic salary data scenario with meaningful differences between departments
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good comments
  - Professional formatting with thousands separator on x-axis
  - Edge colors on bars improve visual definition
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only on y-axis; adding subtle x-axis grid could improve value reading
  - Could use matplotlib histtype=stepfilled or density normalization for enhanced
    visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays three overlapping histograms comparing annual
    salary distributions across three departments: Engineering (steel blue), Marketing
    (golden yellow), and Sales (teal/cyan). The Engineering distribution is centered
    around $95k with a tight spread, Marketing around $75k with moderate spread, and
    Sales around $65k with the widest spread. The semi-transparent bars (alpha=0.5)
    effectively show overlapping regions where distributions intersect. The x-axis
    shows "Annual Salary ($)" formatted in thousands (20k-140k), and the y-axis shows
    "Number of Employees" (0-35). A legend in the upper right clearly identifies each
    department. The title follows the required format: "histogram-overlapping · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai". A subtle y-axis grid with dashed lines aids readability.'
