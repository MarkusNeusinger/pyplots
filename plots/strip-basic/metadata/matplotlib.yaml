review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario using survey scores by department - directly matches spec
    applications
  - Good implementation of jitter (0.2 spread) within spec recommendation (0.1-0.3)
  - Clean visual design with subtle grid and appropriate transparency (0.6)
  - Mean reference lines add value as suggested in spec notes
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=200) for the data density
  - Perfect KISS code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Alternating blue/yellow colors across categories have no semantic meaning - consider
    single color or legend
  - Mean lines lack annotation or legend entry explaining what they represent
  - Y-axis label could include scale range (1-10)
