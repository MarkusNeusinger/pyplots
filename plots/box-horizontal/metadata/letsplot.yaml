review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with varied distributions showcasing boxplot features (different
    medians, spreads, outliers)
  - Clean horizontal orientation with readable service type labels
  - Good color contrast between blue boxes and yellow outliers
  - Realistic tech scenario with appropriate response time values
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (alpha reduced) for better visual balance
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like interactive tooltips or
    hover information
  - Minor empty space on right side of plot due to outlier distribution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response times
    (in milliseconds) for 6 different service types: API Gateway, Database Query,
    Authentication, File Storage, Cache Lookup, and Email Service. The boxes are rendered
    in a muted blue color (#306998) with darker outlines. Outliers are displayed as
    yellow/gold circles. The x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to ~750ms,
    while the y-axis shows "Service Type" with category labels. The title "box-horizontal
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with
    subtle vertical grid lines and no horizontal grid lines. Each service shows distinct
    distributions - Cache Lookup has the tightest distribution near 0-50ms, while
    Database Query and File Storage show wider distributions with outliers extending
    to 600-750ms.'
