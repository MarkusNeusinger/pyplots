review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of treemap using plotnine primitives (geom_rect + geom_text)
    since plotnine has no native treemap geom
  - Well-implemented squarified treemap layout algorithm producing visually balanced
    rectangles
  - Clear labels with subcategory name and dollar value on each rectangle
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue and Yellow
  - Proper use of theme_void for clean treemap appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra descriptive text before the required spec-id format; should
    be "treemap-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" only
  - Labels use black text which works for lighter colors but could be harder to read
    on darker Python Blue rectangles
  image_description: 'The treemap displays budget allocation across 6 departments
    using nested rectangles. Colors used: Python Blue (#306998) for Engineering (R&D,
    Infrastructure, QA), Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for Marketing (Digital, Events),
    Teal (#4ECDC4) for Sales (Direct, Channel, Support), Coral (#FF6B6B) for Operations
    (Logistics, Facilities), Light Green (#95E1A3) for HR (Recruiting), and Plum (#DDA0DD)
    for Finance (Accounting). Each rectangle shows subcategory name and value (e.g.,
    "R&D $450K"). The title "Budget Allocation by Department · treemap-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears at top. A department legend is positioned on the right.
    White borders clearly separate rectangles. The squarified layout algorithm produces
    well-proportioned rectangles filling the canvas appropriately.'
