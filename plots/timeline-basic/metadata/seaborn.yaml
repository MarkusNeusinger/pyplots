review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents text overlap
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate marker sizes and connector lines
  - Well-chosen color palette with distinct colors for each project phase
  - Proper use of seaborn scatterplot with hue parameter for categorical coloring
  - Good realistic data scenario (software project milestones) that demonstrates timeline
    use case
  - Legend placement and styling is well-executed with horizontal layout
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are missing (though dates on x-axis are self-explanatory for a timeline)
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features; most visualization logic uses matplotlib
    directly
  - Red and green colors used together may cause issues for red-green colorblind users
