review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical layout algorithm that calculates node depths based on topological
    ordering
  - Clever handling of bidirectional edges using curved bezier paths to avoid overlap
  - Clean color palette with five distinct, colorblind-safe colors for module groupings
  - Proper use of Altair layered chart composition (edges + curved edges + arrows
    + nodes + labels)
  - Thoughtful arrow positioning using angle encoding for correct orientation along
    edges
  - Interactive tooltips showing node label and group on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Edge lines are relatively thin (strokeWidth=2) making some dependency paths harder
    to follow in the dense central area
  - Layout results in vertical clustering at certain depth levels creating visual
    congestion
  - Does not utilize Altair built-in interactivity features like selection highlighting
    or zoom/pan that would help explore the network
