review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex visualization using polygon primitives
  - Creative approach building violin shapes from KDE using scipy and PolygonSeries
  - 'Diverse data showcasing all features: bimodal distribution, outliers, different
    spreads'
  - Colorblind-safe palette
  - 'All spec requirements met: violin KDE, embedded box plot, median markers, whiskers,
    outliers'
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines visible, which would improve value readability
  - Some unused whitespace at top of plot area
  image_description: The plot displays four violin shapes (representing KDE distributions)
    for Control (blue), Treatment A (yellow), Treatment B (purple), and Treatment
    C (cyan). Each violin has an embedded black box plot showing median (white circle),
    quartiles (rectangular box), and whiskers (vertical lines with caps). Treatment
    C shows red diamond outliers above the main distribution. The title "violin-box
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Response
    Value (units)" and shows values from ~14 to ~110. The X-axis is labeled "Group"
    with the four category names. A legend at the bottom shows all series including
    Median and Outliers.
