review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data variety showing different distribution shapes (tight, wide, bimodal,
    with outliers)
  - Clean layered architecture combining mark_boxplot and mark_circle
  - Creative use of transform_calculate for jitter implementation
  - Good visual balance with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Yellow median line provides good contrast against blue boxes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain box plot vs strip point representation
  - No tooltips for interactivity (Altair strength not fully utilized)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a combined box plot with strip overlay showing
    "Quality Score" (y-axis, ranging from ~20-110) across four departments: Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, and Support (x-axis). Each department shows a blue (#306998)
    box plot with quartile boxes, whiskers, and a distinctive yellow/gold median line.
    Individual data points are overlaid as semi-transparent blue circles with horizontal
    jitter to reduce overlap. Engineering shows a tight, high-scoring distribution
    (~75-95). Marketing has a wider spread (~40-98) with visible outliers. Sales shows
    lower scores (~35-95) with notable outliers. Support displays a bimodal-like pattern
    (~47-90). The title "cat-box-strip · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    appropriate font size. Grid lines are subtle with low opacity. The plot fills
    the canvas well with balanced margins.'
