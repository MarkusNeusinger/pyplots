review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis-inspired colorblind-safe color palette effectively encoding
    velocity magnitude
  - Clean implementation of Euler integration for streamline tracing
  - Well-formatted title following the pyplots.ai convention
  - Good axis labeling with units and clear subtitle explaining the vector field equations
  - Properly distributed starting points across multiple radii creating visually balanced
    concentric streamlines
  weaknesses:
  - HTML overlay legend is not integrated into Highcharts native charting; using colorAxis
    would be more elegant
  - Grid/Legend scoring affected by custom HTML approach rather than native Highcharts
    legend
