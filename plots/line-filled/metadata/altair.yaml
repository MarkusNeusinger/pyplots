review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair gradient feature for the fill, creating a visually appealing
    fade effect
  - Line property within mark_area ensures the line is visible on top of the fill
  - Realistic website traffic data with growth trend and weekly cyclical patterns
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following library conventions
  - Proper font sizes for high-resolution output (scale_factor=3.0)
  - Tooltips included for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Daily Visitors (count)" or "Day of Month (day)")
  - The gradient direction could potentially be inverted (darker at line, lighter
    toward baseline) to better emphasize the data
