review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of logical category ordering (satisfaction scale from negative to
    positive)
  - Clean implementation with appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of Counter for automatic frequency counting from raw data
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability
  - Realistic customer satisfaction survey scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity)
  - Axis labels could include units for clarity (e.g., Number of Responses instead
    of Count)
