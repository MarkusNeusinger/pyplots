review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layer composition to combine density area chart with rug
    marks
  - Clean, readable code with proper KDE computation using scipy
  - Good data example showing bimodal distribution with outliers
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Semi-transparent fill under density curve as spec requested
  - Effective visual communication of both distribution shape and individual data
    points
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks use fixed pixel positions (y=900, y2=850) which could be fragile if
    chart size changes; consider using data-driven positioning
  - No interactivity added (Altair's strength); could benefit from .interactive()
    or tooltips on rug marks
  image_description: The plot displays a density plot with rug marks showing the distribution
    of response times in milliseconds. The main density curve is rendered as a filled
    area chart in blue (#306998) with approximately 50% opacity, showing a bimodal
    distribution with a primary peak around 150ms and a secondary hump around 250ms.
    The rug marks appear as short vertical blue tick marks along the bottom of the
    plot (near y=0), positioned at each individual data point location. The title
    "density-rug · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center in a clear,
    readable font. The x-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately
    50 to 500ms, and the y-axis is labeled "Density" ranging from 0 to about 0.0064.
    The overall layout is clean with good use of the canvas space, and the plot effectively
    demonstrates both the smoothed distribution and individual data point locations.

          Could have used interactive() for added Altair-specific value.
