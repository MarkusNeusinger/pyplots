review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with properly scaled fonts (24pt title, 20pt axis titles,
    16pt tick labels)
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper dodge positioning
  - Meaningful data showing different business patterns (growth, seasonal, peaked)
  - Correct title format and professional minimal theme
  - Good use of scale_fill_manual for custom brand colors
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio (1600x900 base, scaled 3x)
  weaknesses:
  - Red color in the palette may not be ideal for red-green colorblind users (consider
    using a more accessible palette like viridis or colorblind-safe)
  - Grid styling removes x-axis grid but leaves y-axis grid subtle - could be more
    balanced
  - Could add value labels on bars for precise comparisons as noted in spec (optional
    but helpful)
