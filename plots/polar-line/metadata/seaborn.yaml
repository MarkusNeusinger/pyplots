review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color accessibility using seaborn colorblind palette (blue/orange contrast)
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-chosen real-world scenario (hourly temperature by season) that demonstrates
    cyclical data visualization
  - Clean code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good use of closed loops to create continuous circular lines
  - Clear axis labeling with units and 24-hour time format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend styling (fancybox=True, shadow=True) is overly decorative and inconsistent
    with clean seaborn aesthetic
  image_description: 'The plot shows a polar/circular line chart displaying hourly
    temperature patterns for Summer and Winter seasons. The circular layout has hour
    labels (0:00, 3:00, 6:00, 9:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00) around the perimeter,
    representing a 24-hour cycle. Concentric circles show temperature values (10°C,
    20°C, 30°C, 40°C). Two lines with markers are displayed: an orange line for Summer
    (larger radius, ~17-33°C) and a blue line for Winter (smaller radius, ~3-13°C).
    Both lines form closed loops connecting all 24 hourly data points. The legend
    is positioned in the upper right corner with a white background box. The title
    "Hourly Temperature Pattern · polar-line · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold. The plot uses a clean white background with subtle gray grid lines.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme() and sns.color_palette() for styling, but doesn't
          use seaborn's high-level plotting functions (this is acceptable since seaborn
          doesn't have native polar plot support)
  verdict: APPROVED
