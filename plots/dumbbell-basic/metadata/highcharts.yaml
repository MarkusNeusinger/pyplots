review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native dumbbell chart type with proper module loading
  - Clean horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended by spec
  - Data sorted by change magnitude to reveal patterns (spec suggestion implemented)
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Data labels on dots make values immediately readable
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario with appropriate department names
  - Proper inline script embedding for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - All changes are positive (no negative changes shown) - adding one or two departments
    with decreased satisfaction would demonstrate more feature coverage
  - Legend text could be more descriptive with colors mentioned
  - Y-axis title present but x-axis title is null - could benefit from clearer axis
    labeling
