  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization following ggplot2 grammar of graphics
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Data effectively demonstrates Q-Q diagnostic capability with intentional right-tail
    deviation
  - Yellow reference line provides clear visual contrast against blue points
  - Proper standardization of sample quantiles using scipy.stats
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use plotnine built-in stat_qq or stat_qq_line for more idiomatic implementation
  - Axis labels could include context (e.g., Standard Normal in theoretical quantile
    label)
  image_description: The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot comparing sample
    quantiles against theoretical normal quantiles. Blue circular points (#306998)
    with alpha=0.7 are plotted along a yellow dashed diagonal reference line (#FFD43B).
    The title "qq-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis
    is labeled "Theoretical Quantiles" and the y-axis is labeled "Sample Quantiles",
    both ranging roughly from -2.5 to 2.5. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with
    subtle gray gridlines. The 100 data points follow the reference line closely in
    the center but show slight deviation in the upper right tail (above the line),
    correctly demonstrating the right-skewed data generation. The layout is well-balanced
    with good use of the 16:9 canvas.
