review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect spec compliance including correct title format and Y-axis starting at
    zero
  - Realistic exam score scenario that demonstrates histogram use case well
  - Clean KISS code structure following all conventions
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Plotly dual-output capability
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3)
    for better readability
  - Data distribution could include more pronounced outliers to better demonstrate
    histogram ability to reveal distribution shape
  - Could leverage Plotly hover template feature to show bin ranges and counts on
    hover in the HTML version
