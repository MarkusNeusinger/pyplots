review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of areaspline chart type to create smooth frequency polygon visualization
  - Three distinct distributions (normal, tight, bimodal) effectively demonstrate
    comparison capabilities
  - Semi-transparent fills (0.2 opacity) allow overlapping distributions to remain
    visible
  - Proper closing of polygons to zero at both ends as specified
  - Clean implementation with appropriate sizing for 4800x2700
  - Interactive HTML version also generated for full Highcharts interactivity
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full resolution
  - Axis labels lack units (though test scores are unitless by convention)
  image_description: 'The plot displays three frequency polygons comparing test score
    distributions for three classes. The chart uses an areaspline type with semi-transparent
    fills beneath the lines. Class A (blue, Avg: 72) shows a normal distribution peaking
    around 55-65 with the bulk of data in the 40-80 range. Class B (yellow, Avg: 80)
    shows a tighter, higher distribution peaking at around 80 with the highest frequency
    (~50 students). Class C (purple, Bimodal) shows a bimodal distribution with two
    distinct peaks around 55 and 85. The x-axis shows "Test Score" from 0-100, and
    the y-axis shows "Number of Students" from 0-54. The title follows the required
    format "frequency-polygon-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai". A legend is positioned
    in the upper right corner identifying each class with descriptive labels including
    average values. Markers (circles) are visible at data points along the lines.
    The chart has subtle gray grid lines and a white background.'
