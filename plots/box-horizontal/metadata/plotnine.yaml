review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with realistic service response time scenario showing varied
    distributions and outliers
  - Services sorted by median response time as recommended in the spec for easier
    comparison
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotnine grammar of graphics idiom
  - Good visual hierarchy with appropriately sized text elements
  - Python-themed color palette adds personality while remaining readable
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor code issue: panel_grid_major_y uses element_text() instead of element_line()
    which is incorrect'
  - Y-axis label is empty string instead of descriptive label like Service Type
  - Could use more distinctive plotnine features like faceting or statistical transformations
