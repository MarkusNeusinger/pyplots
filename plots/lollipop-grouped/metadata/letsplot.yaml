review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the grouped lollipop concept using geom_segment +
    geom_point layer composition
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of x_pos offset calculation for side-by-side grouping
  - Professional color palette with Python Blue as primary
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned at default location (right edge) with some empty space between
    plot and legend
  - Data variation could be more pronounced to better showcase the grouped comparison
    feature
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across four regions (North, South, East, West). Each region
    has three lollipops side by side representing Electronics (blue #306998), Furniture
    (yellow #FFD43B), and Clothing (red #DC2626). The stems are thin vertical lines
    extending from the baseline (0) to the data values, topped with circular markers.
    The title "lollipop-grouped · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    y-axis shows "Revenue ($ thousands)" ranging from 0 to 300, and the x-axis shows
    "Region" with the four region labels. A legend on the right identifies the three
    product lines. The plot uses a minimal theme with horizontal grid lines only (no
    vertical grid lines), and the layout is well-balanced with good use of canvas
    space.'
