review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular rotation pattern clearly demonstrates the vector field concept
  - Color encoding of magnitude (blue=low, yellow=high) provides additional insight
    as suggested in spec
  - Well-scaled arrows that prevent overlap while remaining visible
  - Proper use of geom_segment with arrow() to simulate quiver functionality
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "X Position (units)" or context like "meters")
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha slightly lower)
  - Could explore additional lets-plot interactive features for the HTML output
  image_description: The plot displays a rotation vector field with arrows arranged
    in a 15x15 grid spanning from -3 to 3 on both axes. The arrows form a clear counter-clockwise
    circular rotation pattern around the origin. Arrow colors transition from dark
    blue (near origin, low magnitude) to yellow/gold (at edges, high magnitude) using
    a gradient color scale. The title reads "Rotation Vector Field · quiver-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". Axis labels are "X Position" and "Y Position". A "Magnitude"
    legend on the right shows the color scale from 0 to 4. The plot uses a minimal
    theme with subtle grid lines and has good visual balance.
