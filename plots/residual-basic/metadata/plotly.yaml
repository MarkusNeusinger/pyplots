  strengths:
  - Excellent heteroscedasticity visualization that demonstrates a key diagnostic
    pattern (variance increasing with fitted values)
  - Well-implemented smoothed trend line using moving average to detect non-linear
    patterns
  - Clean, publication-quality appearance with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Custom hover templates enhance interactive exploration of individual residuals
  - Proper y-axis range symmetric around zero for visual balance
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Fitted Values (units)" would be more informative)
  - Could leverage more Plotly interactive features like range sliders for zooming
    into specific regions or spike lines for precise value reading
  - Marker size (14) slightly large for 150 points - could be reduced to 10-12 for
    cleaner appearance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a residual analysis visualization with the
    title "residual-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The X-axis shows
    "Fitted Values" ranging from approximately 10 to 100, and the Y-axis shows "Residuals"
    ranging from approximately -12 to +12. Blue circular markers (#306998) with moderate
    transparency (alpha ~0.6) represent 150 individual residual points. A yellow dashed
    horizontal line at y=0 serves as the zero reference line. A red solid trend line
    (smoothed moving average) oscillates near zero, revealing subtle patterns in the
    residuals. The plot demonstrates heteroscedasticity - variance clearly increases
    as fitted values increase (tighter spread on the left, wider spread on the right).
    A well-formatted legend in the top-right corner identifies all three elements:
    Residuals, Zero Reference, and Trend (Smoothed). The background is white with
    subtle gray gridlines.'
