review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing throughout with 72px title, 48px axis titles, and 36px labels
    ensuring all text is highly legible
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple, cyan) with distinct marker shapes
    (circle, square, triangle, diamond) for double encoding
  - Clean, realistic data scenario with 4 product categories showing different seasonal
    patterns
  - Proper Highcharts implementation with correct container setup, series configuration,
    and Selenium-based PNG export
  - Good use of subtitle for additional context about the data
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries imported from wrong module (highcharts_core.options.series.area instead
    of highcharts_core.options.series.line) - works but incorrect
  - Legend text could be larger relative to the plot scale for better visibility
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like tooltips configuration or
    animation settings in the HTML output
