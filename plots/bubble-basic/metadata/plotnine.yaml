review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of scale_size_area() for perceptually accurate bubble sizing (scales
    by area, not radius)
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles with proper ggplot grammar
  - Good text sizing throughout with explicit element_text() specifications matching
    library guidelines
  - Appropriate alpha transparency (0.6) handles overlapping bubbles well
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without context or units - could use
    a more realistic scenario
  - Could showcase more plotnine features like adding a color aesthetic for a fourth
    dimension as suggested in spec notes
