review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance — all required features (percentages, colors, legend,
    exploded slice) are implemented
  - Excellent font sizing with all sizes explicitly set for high-resolution output
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with no unnecessary complexity
  - Realistic and neutral data scenario (cloud market share) with accurate proportions
  - Good use of matplotlib-specific features (wedgeprops, pctdistance, destructured
    return values)
  weaknesses:
  - Shadow effect feels slightly dated for modern data visualization aesthetics —
    consider removing or using a more subtle approach
  - No data storytelling beyond the exploded slice — annotations highlighting the
    AWS market leader position or competitive gap would elevate the narrative
  - The Others category at 29% is almost as large as the leader; an annotation or
    callout could highlight this insight
  image_description: The plot shows a pie chart of global cloud infrastructure market
    share with 5 slices. AWS (31.0%) is the largest slice in dark blue (#306998),
    slightly exploded outward for emphasis. Others (29.0%) is in muted gray, Azure
    (25.0%) in golden yellow, Google Cloud (11.0%) in teal, and Alibaba Cloud (4.0%)
    in coral/salmon. Each slice displays a bold white percentage label. Category names
    appear outside the slices. White edge lines separate wedges and a subtle shadow
    adds depth behind the chart. The title "pie-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" sits
    at the top. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all providers with their percentages,
    titled "Cloud Providers", arranged in 3 columns. The chart uses a square 1:1 aspect
    ratio which is appropriate for pie charts.
