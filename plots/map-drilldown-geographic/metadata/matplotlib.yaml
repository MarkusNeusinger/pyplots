review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent conceptual representation of hierarchical drill-down using a static
    medium
  - Clear visual hierarchy with yellow highlights showing drill-down path
  - Well-designed breadcrumb navigation at each level
  - Effective use of color to show data values with appropriate colorbar
  - Clean tile design with rounded corners and good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Uses abstract tiles rather than actual geographic map shapes (specification mentions
    choropleth-style maps)
  - Helper function adds code complexity beyond pure KISS structure
  - Vertical alignment of panels could be improved
  - Tile labels at 12pt could be larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-panel visualization demonstrating
    geographic drill-down functionality. Panel 1 ("Level 1: Regions") shows world
    regions as rounded rectangular tiles arranged in a loose grid pattern: N.AM, EUR,
    ASIA in the top row, AFR in the middle, and S.AM, OCE in the bottom row. North
    America is highlighted with a yellow border indicating it''s the drill-down target.
    Panel 2 ("Level 2: States") shows 10 US states as tiles (MI, WA, OH, NY, CA, IL,
    PA, TX, GA, FL), with California highlighted in yellow. Panel 3 ("Level 3: Cities")
    displays 10 California cities (OAK, SF, SAC, SJ, FRE, SM, LA, LB, SD, IRV) with
    no highlight since it''s the leaf level. All tiles use a Blues colormap where
    darker blue indicates higher sales values. Yellow arrows between panels indicate
    drill-down flow. A vertical colorbar on the right shows "Sales Value (relative)"
    with Low/Medium/High labels. Breadcrumb navigation appears below each panel (World,
    World > United States, World > United States > California). The main title "map-drilldown-geographic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is prominent at the top with an italic subtitle explaining
    the concept.'
