review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the pyramid chart concept with proper left-extending
    (negative) and right-extending (positive) bars
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Smart use of absolute value labels on x-axis for cleaner presentation
  - Good symmetric axis scaling with 15% padding for visual balance
  - Appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Color choice of blue and yellow is colorblind-safe but unconventional for gender
    representation - traditional blue/pink or blue/red would be more immediately recognizable
  - Legend placement in upper right corner is slightly isolated from the chart data
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid chart with 9 age groups
    (0-9 through 80+) arranged vertically on the y-axis. Blue bars extend leftward
    representing male population, while yellow/gold bars extend rightward representing
    female population. The chart shows a realistic age distribution pattern with the
    largest populations in the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups, tapering off at younger
    and older ages. A vertical black center line divides the two sides. The x-axis
    displays "Population (millions)" with absolute values ranging from 0-8 on both
    sides. The legend is positioned in the upper right corner. The title correctly
    follows the required format.
