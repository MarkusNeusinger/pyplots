review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of recursive backtracking maze generation algorithm
  - Clean visual design with appropriate wall thickness and contrast
  - Proper use of increasing sectors per ring for natural circular maze aesthetics
  - Both PNG and HTML export demonstrating Bokeh versatility
  - START and GOAL markers are clearly distinguishable with appropriate colors
  - Square 3600x3600 format is ideal for circular maze presentation
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (get_neighbors, draw_arc) instead of pure linear KISS
    structure
  - Difficulty parameter mentioned in spec is not implemented (currently generates
    one fixed pattern)
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings
    on a white background. The maze features dark gray/black walls (#1a1a1a) forming
    both circular arcs and radial passages between sectors. The number of sectors
    increases from 8 in the innermost ring to 32 in the outermost ring. At the center
    is a yellow/gold circular goal marker with a black star symbol (★). On the outer
    right edge, there is a blue triangle marker pointing inward with "START" text
    above it in blue, indicating the entry point. The title "maze-circular · bokeh
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The walls have consistent thickness,
    and there is a clear gap in the outer boundary at the start position. The maze
    appears algorithmically generated with a single solution path guaranteed by the
    recursive backtracking algorithm.
