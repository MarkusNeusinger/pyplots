review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including zero reference
    line, LOESS smoothing, ±2σ bands, and outlier highlighting
  - Clear demonstration of non-linear residual pattern through LOESS line - educationally
    valuable
  - Strong colorblind-safe palette with Python logo colors (blue/yellow)
  - Good use of Altair declarative layering for combining multiple visual elements
  - Realistic housing price scenario makes the plot immediately comprehensible
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement is slightly isolated from the main chart area - could be positioned
    closer
  - Points use outlined circles which can be slightly less visible than filled circles
    at smaller sizes
  - The grid lines behind the ±2σ dashed lines create slight visual noise
