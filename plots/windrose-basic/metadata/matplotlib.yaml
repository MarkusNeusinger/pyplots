review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar stacked bar chart following meteorological conventions
    (North at top, clockwise direction)
  - Realistic wind data simulation using Weibull distribution with prevailing SW winds
    and secondary NW pattern
  - Clean color progression from cool blues (calm) to warm yellows/oranges (strong)
    matching spec requirements
  - Clear 16-sector direction binning with proper wrap-around handling at 0/360 degrees
  - Well-sized text throughout with bold direction labels for readability
  - White edge separation between stacked bar segments improves visual distinction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement at (-0.15, -0.15) causes it to float isolated in the lower-left
    corner rather than being positioned closer to the plot area
  - The 15+ m/s (red) speed category is present in legend but barely visible in data,
    making the legend somewhat misleading about what speeds are actually represented
