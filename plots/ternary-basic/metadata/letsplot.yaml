review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinates from scratch using Cartesian transformation
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining the coordinate conversion
  - Appropriate use of soil classification as a realistic domain example
  - Grid lines and tick labels enhance readability without cluttering
  - Good color choices that are colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra text before the required format
  - Legend position could be closer to the plot to reduce empty space
  - Tick label font size could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary diagram in the form of an equilateral
    triangle representing soil composition data. The three vertices are labeled "Sand
    (%)" (bottom-left), "Silt (%)" (bottom-right), and "Clay (%)" (top), all in bold
    black text. Grid lines are drawn at 20% intervals (20, 40, 60, 80) with subtle
    gray lines creating a readable reference system. Tick labels appear along each
    edge. Data points are shown as colored circles: blue (Sandy soils clustered in
    lower-left), yellow (Silty soils clustered in lower-right), and red (Clayey soils
    clustered toward the top). A legend titled "Soil Type" on the right side identifies
    the three categories. The title "Soil Composition · ternary-basic · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left.'
