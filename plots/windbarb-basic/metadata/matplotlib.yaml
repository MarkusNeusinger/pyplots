review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of all wind barb features including calm circles, half
    barbs, full barbs, and pennants
  - Well-documented legend box explaining the standard meteorological notation
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of barb_increments parameter to specify standard meteorological notation
  - Appropriate grid spacing prevents barb overlap as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box slightly overlaps with the barb at position (0,5) in the upper left
  - Geographic context could be more realistic (e.g., using actual longitude values
    like 120-130°E instead of 0-9)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10×6 grid of wind barbs on a coordinate
    system with Longitude (°E) on the x-axis (0-9) and Latitude (°N) on the y-axis
    (0-5). All barbs are rendered in a consistent blue color (#306998). The wind barbs
    show varying wind speeds and directions: several barbs have multiple full barbs
    indicating winds of 20-30 knots, a few show pennants (triangular flags) indicating
    strong winds of 50+ knots (visible at approximately positions (2,1), (5,1), (5,5),
    and (8,3)), and three open circles indicating calm winds (<2.5 kt) are visible
    at positions (0,0), (5,2), and (5,4). A legend box in the upper left corner explains
    the barb notation using monospace font. The title "windbarb-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. A subtle dashed grid with low alpha is
    present in the background.'
