review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layering to compose error bars from rule + tick marks
    for caps
  - Clean demonstration of asymmetric error bars (Treatment C and D show different
    upper/lower bounds)
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good font sizing throughout (18pt labels, 22pt titles, 28pt main title)
  - Subtle dashed grid that does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace at bottom since all values
    are above 20
  - No tooltip added for interactivity (Altair strength not fully utilized)
  image_description: The plot displays a basic error bar visualization with 6 experimental
    groups (Control, Treatment A through E) on the x-axis and "Response Value (units)"
    on the y-axis ranging from 0 to 54. Each data point is shown as a blue circle
    (#306998) with vertical error bars extending above and below. The error bars have
    visible caps (horizontal tick marks) at both ends. The title "errorbar-basic ·
    altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clear, readable font. The y-axis
    has a subtle dashed grid. Notably, Treatment C and Treatment D show asymmetric
    error bars - Treatment C has a larger lower error than upper, while Treatment
    D has a larger upper error than lower. All text is clearly legible with appropriate
    font sizes.

        comment: Good use of Altair layering (mark_circle, mark_rule, mark_tick),
          declarative encoding. Could leverage tooltips or selections for interactivity.
