review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear color differentiation between levels (gray
    root, blue departments, yellow teams)
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to draw circles since plotnine lacks
    native circle packing
  - Proper area encoding (r ∝ sqrt(value)) for accurate visual perception of sizes
  - Clean, readable code with well-documented manual layout calculations
  - Realistic company organizational data that effectively demonstrates the visualization
    concept
  - All labels readable with appropriate sizing and bold text for emphasis
  weaknesses:
  - Manual circle positioning rather than algorithmic packing means circles do not
    pack as tightly as possible
  - Slight empty space at bottom of the root circle could be better utilized
