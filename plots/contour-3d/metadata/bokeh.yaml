review:
  strengths:
  - Impressive manual 3D projection implementation using painter algorithm for correct
    depth ordering
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML output provided
  - Clean contour line visualization on the surface
  - Base plane contour projections add reference value
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (ColorBar, HoverTool, interactive toolbar)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels (X, Y, Z) appear smaller than specified in code - may be a rendering/export
    issue
  - Relies on matplotlib for contour extraction instead of a pure Bokeh solution
  - Base plane dashed contours are quite subtle and hard to see
  - The Z-axis label inconsistency (Amplitude vs Height)
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D contour visualization using an isometric
    projection technique. A surface composed of two Gaussian peaks (one primary peak
    near the center-left and a secondary smaller peak) is rendered using the Viridis
    colormap, transitioning from dark purple (low values ~0.2) to yellow (high values
    ~1.0). Dark contour lines are drawn on the surface showing isolines at regular
    intervals. The 3D coordinate system is indicated by three axis arrows (X, Y, Z)
    at the bottom-left corner. A vertical colorbar labeled "Height (Z)" is positioned
    on the right side. Dashed contour lines are projected onto the base plane for
    reference. The title "contour-3d · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left
    corner.
