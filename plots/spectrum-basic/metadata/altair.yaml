review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent FFT computation with proper normalization and dB conversion
  - Clear visualization of multiple frequency components (50 Hz dominant, 120 Hz secondary,
    200 Hz weak)
  - Appropriate use of Altair declarative encoding with typed columns
  - Interactive tooltips with number formatting
  - Proper scale domains ensure all data is visible
  - Clean KISS code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Could add mark_rule() or mark_point() to highlight peak frequencies
  - No use of Altair selection/interactivity features (zoom/pan)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a frequency spectrum with a blue line on a
    white background. The X-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" from 0 to 300 Hz, and the
    Y-axis shows "Amplitude (dB)" from -80 to 10 dB. Three distinct peaks are clearly
    visible: a dominant peak at 50 Hz reaching approximately 0 dB, a secondary peak
    at 120 Hz at about -7 dB, and a smaller peak at 200 Hz at approximately -13 dB.
    The noise floor fluctuates around -45 to -50 dB. The title "spectrum-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Subtle gray grid lines are visible, and the
    overall layout is well-balanced with good canvas utilization.'
