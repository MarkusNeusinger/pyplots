review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Correct ECDF implementation using step function with shape=hv
  - Clean, professional visual design with well-balanced layout
  - Proper y-axis range [0, 1] as required by spec
  - Good use of Plotly white template and subtle grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Value is generic - could use more descriptive context
  - Data scenario is generic normal distribution - could represent a real-world context
  - Could leverage Plotly interactivity features more (hover tooltips showing exact
    percentiles)
