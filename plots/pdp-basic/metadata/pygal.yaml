review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements PDP with confidence intervals using sklearn partial_dependence
    function
  - Uses appropriate XY chart type for continuous line plot
  - Good custom styling with significantly increased font sizes for target resolution
  - Includes rug plot showing training data distribution as specified
  - Clean title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Reproducible with fixed random seeds
  weaknesses:
  - Rug plot markers are not very visible - dots along x-axis bottom are hard to see
  - Yellow CI Upper line has low contrast against white background
  - Main PDP line appears stepped rather than smooth due to discrete grid points
  - Legend spacing could be improved - items appear compressed at bottom
