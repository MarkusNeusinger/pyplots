review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Marimekko chart concept using rect marks with calculated
    x/y positions
  - Proper variable-width bars that correctly represent market size proportions
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Informative tooltips showing region, product, revenue, and percentage
  - Region labels include market size totals for context
  - White stroke between segments provides clear visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are somewhat dense (every 5 units) which could be simplified
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently at 0.3 opacity)
  - Could add value labels on larger segments as suggested in spec notes
