review:
  strengths:
  - Creative adaptation of pygal Dot chart for maze rendering
  - Proper DFS maze generation algorithm ensuring single solution
  - Clean black-and-white design optimized for printing
  - Correct title format and square aspect ratio
  - SVG post-processing to add S/G markers at calculated positions
  - Proper entrance and exit gaps at maze borders
  weaknesses:
  - S and G markers could be slightly more prominent (larger font size would improve
    visibility)
  - Passage width is adequate but on the tighter side for comfortable pen/pencil marking
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 printable maze puzzle rendered using
    pygal's Dot chart. The maze consists of black circular dots forming the walls
    on a white background, creating clear passages between them. The title "maze-printable
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clean monospace font. An "S" marker
    indicates the start position near the top-left corner (with an entrance gap at
    the top border), and a "G" marker indicates the goal position near the bottom-right
    corner (with an exit gap at the bottom border). The maze uses the square 3600×3600
    format, with the maze grid filling the canvas well. The black-and-white design
    is print-friendly with good contrast.
