review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear proportional arc heights showing connection
    distances
  - Smart use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) for overlapping arcs
  - Weight-based line thickness provides additional dimension
  - Clean minimalist styling with hidden axes appropriate for arc diagrams
  - Realistic character interaction scenario matches spec applications
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability at high resolution
  - Does not leverage lets-plot specific interactive features (could use tooltips
    on hover)
