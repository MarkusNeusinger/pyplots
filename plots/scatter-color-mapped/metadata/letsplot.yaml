review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-accessible
  - Well-implemented interactive tooltips showing X, Y coordinates and temperature
    on hover
  - Clean data generation with realistic spatial clustering pattern that demonstrates
    correlation between position and temperature
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700 px)
  - Good use of theme_minimal with customized grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - Point size (size=5) could be slightly larger (size=6-7) for 150 data points to
    improve visibility
  - Grid styling uses dashed lines which appear somewhat busy; solid subtle lines
    might be cleaner
