review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of band plot with proper geom_ribbon for confidence interval
  - Data shows increasing uncertainty over time (heteroscedasticity) which is realistic
    and educational
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines
  - Appropriate alpha (0.3) for band transparency as per spec recommendation
  - Correct use of 1600x900 base size with scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are solid gray rather than using subtle alpha for better visual subtlety
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive interactive features or tooltips
