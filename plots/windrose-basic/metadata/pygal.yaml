review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic wind data simulation using mixture of normal distributions and Weibull
    speeds
  - Clean cumulative stacking approach for representing speed bins
  - Good use of square canvas (3600x3600) appropriate for polar visualization
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for the large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme is inverted from meteorological convention - spec requires cool colors
    for calm winds and warm colors for strong winds, but implementation shows red
    for calm (0-3 m/s) and blue for strong (>12 m/s)
  - Legend displays speed categories in reverse order (>12 m/s first), which compounds
    the color inversion confusion
