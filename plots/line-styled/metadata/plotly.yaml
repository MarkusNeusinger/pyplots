review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with all four line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    easily distinguishable
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario with temperature sensors showing believable diurnal
    patterns
  - Proper use of Plotly layout customization for professional appearance
  - Good color palette with distinct, accessible colors
  - Appropriate line width (4) for the canvas size
  - Clean, simple code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Blue (#306998) and purple (#9C27B0) lines could be more differentiated for better
    colorblind accessibility
  - Could utilize Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates to enhance
    interactivity
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is at the very low end of visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart with temperature readings from
    four different sensors over a 24-hour period (0-23 hours). The chart uses a white
    background with a subtle grid. Four distinct line styles are clearly visible:

    - **Outdoor Sensor**: Solid blue line (#306998) showing the largest temperature
    swing (~7°C to ~23°C)

    - **Indoor Sensor**: Dashed yellow/gold line (#FFD43B) with moderate variation
    (~17°C to ~23°C)

    - **Greenhouse Sensor**: Dotted green line (#4CAF50) with medium variation (~12°C
    to ~22°C)

    - **Storage Sensor**: Dash-dot purple line (#9C27B0) with the smallest variation
    (~20°C to ~24°C)


    The title "line-styled · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis
    shows "Hour of Day" (0-23 in increments of 4), and the y-axis shows "Temperature
    (°C)" (6-24). A well-positioned legend in the upper-left corner clearly maps each
    line style to its sensor name.'

        comment: Uses Plotly's Graph Objects correctly with proper trace management;
          exports HTML for interactivity. However, doesn't leverage more advanced
          Plotly features like hover templates or rangeslider.
  verdict: APPROVED
