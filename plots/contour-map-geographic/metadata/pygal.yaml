review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using pygal XY chart with custom SVG injection for contours
  - Well-implemented marching squares algorithm for contour line generation
  - Good colorbar implementation with clear labels
  - Realistic temperature data over Europe with warm/cold anomalies
  - Proper geographic coastline outlines add context
  - Contour labels with white background boxes enhance readability
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on raw SVG injection rather than native pygal features limits the
    pygal-ness of the implementation
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (lower opacity or solid lines)
  - Some contour lines are thin and subtle against the filled background
  image_description: The plot displays a contour map of temperature data over a geographic
    region covering Europe and the Atlantic (longitude -30°E to 50°E, latitude 25°N
    to 70°N). The visualization uses a diverging color scheme from deep blue (-4°C)
    through light blue/white to orange/red (24°C). Filled color bands show temperature
    gradients across the region, with dark contour lines (isolines) overlaid at 4°C
    intervals. A cold blue region is visible in the northwest (around Iceland/Norwegian
    Sea area) while warmer red/pink areas dominate the Mediterranean and southern
    regions. Simplified coastline outlines (in gray) represent Europe, British Isles,
    Iberian Peninsula, Italy, Scandinavia, and North Africa. Temperature labels (e.g.,
    -4°C, 0°C, 4°C, 8°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 24°C) are placed at strategic positions
    with white background boxes for readability. A vertical colorbar on the right
    shows the temperature scale with "Temperature" label. The title follows the correct
    format "contour-map-geographic · pygal · pyplots.ai". Axes are labeled with "Longitude
    (°E)" and "Latitude (°N)" with appropriate tick marks.

        comment: All text is readable; title, axis labels, colorbar labels, and contour
          labels are clear. Slightly reduced due to some contour labels being small.
