review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot syntax
  - Realistic salary distribution scenario with meaningful department differences
  - 'Proper display of all boxplot components: median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers'
  - Good text sizing with element_text customizations for readability
  - Clean KISS code structure following library conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Default color palette could be improved with scale_fill_brewer for better colorblind
    accessibility
  - No subtle grid lines to aid value reading (theme_minimal removes them by default)
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace since no salaries are near
    zero
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box-and-whisker chart showing salary distributions
    across four departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). Each department
    has a distinctly colored box: Engineering (coral/salmon), Marketing (olive green),
    Sales (cyan/turquoise), and Support (purple/violet). The boxes show median lines,
    quartiles, and whiskers extending to 1.5×IQR. Outliers are visible as individual
    gray points above several boxes (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). The
    title "box-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis labeled "Department"
    and Y-axis labeled "Salary ($)" with values ranging from 0 to 150000.'
