review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of monthly temperature data to demonstrate cyclical polar line
    visualization
  - Clear visual contrast between continental and oceanic climate patterns
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue and yellow)
  - Good text sizing throughout for the 3600x3600 canvas
  - Polygon grid interpolation creates a clean spider-web style grid
  - Different marker symbols (circle vs diamond) enhance series differentiation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned too far from the chart with excessive whitespace between
    the chart area and the legend
  - The Y-axis title appears rotated/sideways in the center which is slightly awkward
    to read
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar line chart on a white background with
    the title "polar-line · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top and subtitle "Monthly
    Average Temperature Patterns" below. The chart shows two line series representing
    temperature patterns for two cities: "Continental City" (blue/dark blue color
    with circle markers, #306998) and "Oceanic City" (yellow/gold color with diamond
    markers, #FFD43B). The angular axis displays months (Jan through Dec) around the
    perimeter in a clockwise direction starting from the top. The radial axis shows
    temperature values from 0 to 28°C with concentric polygon gridlines. The Continental
    City line shows a larger amplitude pattern (ranging from ~2°C in winter to ~26°C
    in summer), while the Oceanic City line shows a more moderate pattern (~8-21°C).
    The legend is positioned at the bottom center of the image.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts polar chart with gridLineInterpolation polygon, multiple
          series with different marker symbols. Could have used more advanced features
          like tooltips configuration or animation options.
