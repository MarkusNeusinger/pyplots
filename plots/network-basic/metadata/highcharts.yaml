review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with four distinct community colors
  - Node size scaling by degree effectively shows connection importance
  - Clean force-directed layout groups communities naturally
  - Proper use of Highcharts networkgraph module with custom node configuration
  - Cross-community bridges are clearly visible connecting the four groups
  - Legend correctly documents all communities
  weaknesses:
  - Some node labels appear outside nodes (Alice, David, Grace, Frank, Olivia, Noah,
    Sara, Paul) rather than centered inside, creating visual inconsistency
  - Network could be positioned more centrally with legend closer to the visualization
