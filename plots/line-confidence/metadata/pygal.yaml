review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with proper KISS pattern
  - Good data generation showing widening uncertainty over time
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Appropriate canvas size (4800x2700)
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval band is completely invisible - the white fill masking technique
    does not work as intended
  - The plot shows only a single line when it should display a shaded region between
    upper and lower bounds
  - Legend claims 95% Confidence Interval exists but it is not rendered visibly
  - Pygal fill behavior fills to baseline not between series making the layering approach
    ineffective
