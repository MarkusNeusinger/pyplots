review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent educational visualization comparing 4 distinct map projections
  - Tissot indicatrices clearly demonstrate distortion characteristics of each projection
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (gridplot, Div, ColumnDataSource, dual export)
  - Color scheme is accessible and visually appealing
  - Well-structured layout with clear subplot labels
  weaknesses:
  - Missing coastlines/country boundaries as specified
  - Uses helper functions violating KISS structure principle
  - Main title and subtitle text could be larger for better readability at full size
  - Legend/axis labels not present for coordinate reference
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid showing four different map projections:
    Equirectangular (Plate Carrée), Mercator, Sinusoidal, and Mollweide. Each subplot
    shows blue graticule lines (latitude/longitude grid at 30° intervals) and yellow
    Tissot indicatrices (circles that become ellipses to show projection distortion).
    The main title "map-projections · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue
    text with a subtitle explaining the yellow circles. The Equirectangular projection
    shows circles as uniform shapes. The Mercator projection shows circles becoming
    vertically stretched toward the poles. The Sinusoidal projection shows a characteristic
    pinched shape at the edges with circles compressed horizontally near the boundaries.
    The Mollweide projection shows an elliptical globe shape with circles distorted
    toward the edges. Background is light gray (#f5f5f5) with white borders and blue
    outline frames around each subplot.'
