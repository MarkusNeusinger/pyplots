review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle with clear data generation logic
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar with proper stacking via position=stack
  - Good color palette with distinct, visually pleasing colors (blue, yellow, green,
    crimson)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good seasonality pattern in data makes the visualization more realistic and engaging
  - Y-axis starts at zero as required for stacked area charts to avoid misleading
    proportions
  - Produces both PNG and HTML outputs for maximum utility
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are barely visible, making it harder to read exact values; consider
    increasing grid alpha
  - Color palette includes red-green combination which may be challenging for colorblind
    users; consider using a fully colorblind-safe palette
