review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts treemap with stripes layout algorithm to approximate
    mosaic plot behavior
  - Classic Titanic dataset provides immediately recognizable and meaningful context
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow)
  - Clear hierarchical structure with class labels at top level and survival status
    within
  - Inline legend in subtitle is elegant and space-efficient
  - White borders provide clear visual separation between categories
  weaknesses:
  - Not a true mosaic plot (spec suggests statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot); treemap
    is a reasonable approximation but widths represent total counts rather than marginal
    proportions
  - Some white space at bottom of canvas could be better utilized
  - Title font size could be larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Title format includes descriptive text before the required format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a treemap-style mosaic visualization of Titanic
    survival data by passenger class. The chart uses a stripes layout algorithm creating
    horizontal divisions for each class (Crew, Third, First, Second from top to bottom).
    Each class section is subdivided into "Survived" (Python Blue #306998) and "Died"
    (Python Yellow #FFD43B) rectangles. The Crew and Third class sections are the
    largest, showing the highest passenger counts. Within each class, the proportions
    clearly show survival rates - First class has more survivors than deaths, while
    Crew and Third class have significantly more deaths than survivors. The title
    reads "Titanic Survival by Class · mosaic-categorical · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    with a subtitle explaining the area proportionality and color legend. Labels are
    displayed on each rectangle showing the class name and survival status. White
    borders separate the rectangles for clarity.'
