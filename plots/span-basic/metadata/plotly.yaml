review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical and horizontal spans with realistic economic
    data
  - Uses plotly native add_hrect() and add_vrect() methods which are the idiomatic
    way to create spans
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Both span regions have clear text annotations explaining their purpose
  - Semi-transparent fills (0.25 opacity) allow underlying data and overlapping regions
    to remain visible
  - Realistic recession period scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g. Economic Index base=100 would be more informative)
  - HTML output could leverage plotly interactive features (hover info on spans, range
    slider) but these are optional enhancements
