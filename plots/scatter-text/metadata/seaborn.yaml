review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with bold font and appropriate sizing
  - Colorblind-safe palette with 10 distinct category colors
  - Good use of seaborn theming (whitegrid style, talk context)
  - Realistic data scenario showing programming language embeddings
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the final plot despite code building legend elements
  - Minor text overlap between MATLAB/Swift and Go/Ruby pairs
  image_description: 'The plot displays 24 programming language names positioned in
    a 2D coordinate space simulating t-SNE dimensionality reduction. Each language
    name is rendered as bold text at its coordinate position, with different colors
    representing categories: General Purpose (blue - Python), Web (red/pink - JavaScript,
    PHP, TypeScript), Enterprise (green - Java), Systems (yellow/olive - C++, Go,
    Rust), Mobile (purple - Swift, Kotlin, Dart), JVM (gray - Scala), Data Science
    (teal - R, Julia, MATLAB), Functional (dark purple/maroon - Haskell, Elixir, Clojure,
    F#), Scripting (cyan - Ruby, Perl, Lua, Bash), and Data (olive - SQL). The title
    "scatter-text · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large font. Axes are
    labeled "Dimension 1 (t-SNE)" and "Dimension 2 (t-SNE)" with a subtle dashed grid
    (alpha ~0.3). The plot spans approximately -4 to 4 on both axes. Languages are
    well-distributed across the canvas with minimal overlap, though some pairs like
    MATLAB/Swift and Go/Ruby are positioned close together. The whitegrid seaborn
    style provides a clean background. No legend is visible in the rendered image
    despite the code attempting to create one.'
