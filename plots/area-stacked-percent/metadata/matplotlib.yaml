  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the 100% stacked area visualization matching spec requirements
    perfectly
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Colorblind-friendly color palette with good contrast between adjacent areas
  - White edge lines between areas enhance visual clarity
  - Realistic market share scenario with meaningful trends showing composition changes
  - Perfect title format and appropriate font sizes throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Legend slightly overlaps the data area at the top right - could be positioned
    outside the plot area
  - X-axis label Year is generic - could be more descriptive like Year (2015-2024)
  - Library features could be enhanced with annotations showing key percentages or
    trend indicators
  image_description: The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing market share
    evolution for four companies (A, B, C, D) from 2015 to 2024. The color scheme
    uses dark blue (#306998) for Company A at the bottom, golden yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Company B, light blue (#4B8BBE) for Company C, and pale yellow (#FFE873) for
    Company D at the top. The Y-axis shows "Market Share (%)" with tick marks at 0%,
    25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The X-axis shows "Year" with all years from 2015-2024
    labeled. A legend is positioned in the upper right corner with a semi-transparent
    background. Horizontal dashed grid lines appear at 25% intervals. The title reads
    "area-stacked-percent · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The visualization clearly shows
    Company A declining from ~45% to ~24%, Company B growing from ~30% to ~41%, Company
    C steadily increasing from ~15% to ~24%, and Company D remaining stable around
    10-11%.

        comment: Uses standard stackplot, which is correct but not distinctive. Could
          use annotations, fill_between customization, or other matplotlib-specific
          features
