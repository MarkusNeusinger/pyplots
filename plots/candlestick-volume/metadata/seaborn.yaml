review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 75%/25% vertical split
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme consistently applied across both panes
  - Good use of seaborn for statistical context (lineplot for wicks, barplot for volume)
  - Clean code structure with realistic stock data generation
  - Proper date formatting and shared x-axis between panes
  - Legend clearly explains bullish vs bearish classification
  weaknesses:
  - Volume bars appear as paired/dodged bars per day instead of single bars (seaborn
    barplot with hue creates side-by-side bars)
  - Crosshair feature from spec not effectively visible in rendered output
  - Volume axis label missing units (should indicate shares or M shares)
