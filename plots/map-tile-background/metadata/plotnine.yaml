review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution to simulate tile-like background using geom_rect grid without
    external map dependencies
  - 'Proper grammar of graphics layering: tiles → coastline → points → labels'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct category colors
  - Size encoding effectively communicates visitor volume
  - Attribution text included as per spec requirement
  - Fixed aspect ratio (coord_fixed) maintains geographic accuracy
  weaknesses:
  - Title truncated on left edge (SF Landmarks appears as arks)
  - Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39 labels still overlap despite nudge adjustments
  - Plot occupies less than ideal canvas area with large white space below
  image_description: 'The plot displays a map of San Francisco landmarks with a simulated
    tile background. The background consists of a grid of rectangles colored in beige
    (land) and light blue (water), representing a stylized map-tile effect. A dark
    gray coastline polygon outlines the SF peninsula. Data points are rendered as
    colored circles with size encoding visitor counts (thousands per year) - larger
    circles represent more visitors. The points are color-coded by category using
    a colorblind-safe palette: blue for Landmarks, cyan for Tourism, green for Museum,
    yellow for Shopping, orange for Transport, red for Sports, purple for Cultural,
    and brown for Historic. Four labels identify top attractions: Golden Gate Bridge,
    Fisherman''s Wharf (partially visible as "Fisherma"), Pier 39, and Union Square
    - displayed in white boxes. The title reads "SF Landmarks · map-tile-background
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" (truncated at left showing "arks"). Axis labels show
    Longitude (°) and Latitude (°) with appropriate tick marks. Two legends on the
    right show Visitors (K/yr) with size encoding and Category with color encoding.'
