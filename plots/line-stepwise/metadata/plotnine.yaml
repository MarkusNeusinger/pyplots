review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_step with direction="hv" for proper step function visualization
  - Realistic and relatable CPU utilization scenario that perfectly demonstrates discrete
    state changes
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation following plotnine best practices
  - Well-balanced layout with appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Data shows clear daily pattern with morning ramp-up, business hours peak, and
    evening wind-down
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: panel_grid_major and panel_grid_minor use element_text() instead of element_line()
    - this does not cause visible issues but is technically incorrect for grid styling'
