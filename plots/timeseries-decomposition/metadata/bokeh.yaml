review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all four decomposition components with clear visual
    separation
  - Uses statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper statistical decomposition
  - Clean shared x-axis implementation using x_range linking
  - Appropriate font sizes for the 4800px canvas width
  - Classic airline passenger example with realistic trend and seasonal patterns
  - Good use of dashed grid lines that do not distract from the data
  weaknesses:
  - Bokeh toolbar visible on right side adds visual clutter; could be hidden for static
    export
  - Y-axis label rotation on Passengers (thousands) makes it slightly harder to read
  - Panel heights (620px each) leave some unused vertical space in 2700px target
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
