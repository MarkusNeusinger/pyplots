review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme with four distinct, colorblind-accessible colors
  - Clear part-to-whole visualization showing quarterly revenue composition
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic business data scenario with logical growth patterns
  - Clean, simple code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing on large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are barely visible; could benefit from slightly more prominent horizontal
    guides
  - Legend placement in upper-left is disconnected from the chart area
  - No value labels on segments (spec suggests consider adding total value labels)
