review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the grammar of graphics with proper layering (ggplot
    + geom_area + scales + labs + theme)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic market share scenario with meaningful trend data showing growth, decline,
    and stability
  - Proper percentage normalization in the data preparation
  - Good use of pd.Categorical for controlling stack order
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid and legend styling could be improved - legend appears slightly isolated from
    the plot area
  - The seed is set but data is actually hardcoded/deterministic, making the seed
    unnecessary
  - Could benefit from more dramatic proportion shifts to better demonstrate the plot
    type capabilities
