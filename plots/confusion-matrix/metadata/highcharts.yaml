review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and cell annotations
  - Sequential blue colormap is colorblind-accessible and effectively shows magnitude
  - Proper confusion matrix orientation with True Labels on y-axis and Predicted Labels
    on x-axis
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: custom tooltip showing correct/misclassified
    status, color axis with gradient stops'
  - White cell borders provide clean visual separation
  - Realistic 4-class classification scenario with believable misclassification patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could better utilize the square canvas - some wasted space around edges
  - np.random.seed(42) is set but data is entirely hardcoded, making the seed unnecessary
  - Colorbar scale goes to 100 but max value is 87, slightly misleading range
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 confusion matrix heatmap for an image
    classification model with classes: Cat, Dog, Bird, and Fish. The matrix uses a
    sequential blue colormap ranging from light blue (low values ~0) to dark blue
    (high values ~85-87). The diagonal shows strong correct predictions (87, 76, 82,
    85) in dark blue, while off-diagonal misclassifications appear in lighter shades.
    Each cell displays its count value in bold black text with white outline. The
    title "confusion-matrix · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    "Image Classification Model Performance". The y-axis is labeled "True Label" and
    x-axis "Predicted Label". A vertical colorbar on the right shows the "Count" scale
    from 0-100.'
