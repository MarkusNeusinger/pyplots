review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Gapminder-style visualization with clear temporal storytelling across
    4 key time points
  - Play/pause controls and timeline slider visually represented, showing the intended
    interactivity concept
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good distinction between 8 countries
  - Prominent year watermarks in each panel enhance time-context awareness
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with realistic country development
    data
  weaknesses:
  - The control panel rendering shows some visual artifacts in the final image (timeline
    legend text appears garbled)
  - Missing optional trail visualization to show entity paths over time as mentioned
    in spec notes
