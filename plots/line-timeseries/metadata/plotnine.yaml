review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics pattern with proper layering (geom_line
    + geom_point)
  - Smart date formatting using mizani breaks_date and label_date for intelligent
    x-axis labeling
  - Properly rotated x-axis labels (45 degrees) to prevent overlap
  - Realistic stock price simulation with 252 business days (one trading year)
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Subtle grid lines with appropriate alpha values
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid scoring: VQ-07 should be 2/2 since no legend is needed and grid is well-configured
    (correcting my assessment)'
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing stock price
    data over the year 2024 (January through December). The chart uses a blue line
    (#306998) connecting daily price points, starting around $100 in January, peaking
    above $105 in early February, then declining through mid-year to approximately
    $81-82, before recovering to around $95-100 by December. The x-axis shows dates
    in "Mon YYYY" format (Feb 2024, Apr 2024, Jun 2024, Aug 2024, Oct 2024, Dec 2024)
    with rotated labels at 45 degrees. The y-axis shows "Stock Price ($)" ranging
    from approximately 80 to just above 100. The title "line-timeseries · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot has a minimal theme with subtle gray
    grid lines on both axes, and the overall layout is clean with good use of the
    canvas space.
