review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to implementing Chernoff faces in Altair using layered point
    marks
  - Good use of Iris dataset as a realistic multivariate example
  - Clear feature-to-facial-attribute mapping documented in the visualization
  - Species color coding allows pattern recognition across groups
  - Proper grid layout for comparing 12 faces side by side
  weaknesses:
  - Feature mapping legend text overlaps with Sample 9 label area - needs repositioning
  - Legend color points do not match actual face colors (setosa legend shows small
    blue dot but faces use larger translucent blue)
  - Faces lack eyebrow feature mentioned in specification (eyebrow slant)
  - All facial features are circles - mouth should be more elliptical/curved for better
    face representation
  - Small faces make subtle feature differences hard to distinguish visually
  - Implementation does not leverage Altair declarative strengths - uses manual point
    placement instead of proper layered mark compositions
