review:
  strengths:
  - Good data context with realistic temperature/humidity climate data showing three
    distinct clusters
  - Proper axis labels with units (°C and %)
  - Colorblind-safe blues color scheme
  - Correct title format following specification
  - Clean, readable code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Uses heatmap (mark_rect with binning) instead of actual contour lines - does not
    match the density contour plot specification
  - Missing grid lines that would aid in reading density values
  - Does not use Altair transform_density() which could create smoother density representation
  - The binned rectangle approach creates a pixelated appearance rather than smooth
    contour lines as specified
