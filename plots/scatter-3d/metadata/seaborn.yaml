review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with clear data generation for 3 distinct clusters
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for fourth dimension (distance from origin)
  - Good axis labels with scientific units (nm)
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for data density
  - Title follows correct format specification
  - Reproducible with seed(42)
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Seaborn has no native 3D scatter plot capability - uses matplotlib
    mplot3d for actual plotting with seaborn only providing styling. Should be flagged
    as not-feasible for seaborn (AR-06)'
  - Figsize (12, 12) does not match recommended output sizes
  - Z-axis label appears partially cut off in rendered output
  - No categorical legend distinguishing the three clusters
