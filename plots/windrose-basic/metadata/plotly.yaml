review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly go.Barpolar for proper wind rose visualization
  - Meteorologically accurate data simulation with Weibull distribution and prevailing
    westerly winds
  - Clean color progression from cool (calm) to warm (strong) following spec conventions
  - Proper polar orientation with North at top (rotation=90, clockwise)
  - Good text sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700)
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs leveraging Plotly interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit Frequency (%) label for the radial axis to clarify what percentages
    represent
  - Color palette progression from dark blue to light blue could have slightly more
    contrast for the lowest speed bins
  image_description: The plot displays a wind rose chart on a polar coordinate system
    with 8 compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) arranged clockwise with
    North at the top. Each direction shows stacked bars representing wind speed frequency
    distributions. The color scheme progresses from dark navy blue (0-3 m/s) through
    light blue (3-6 m/s), yellow (6-9 m/s), orange (9-12 m/s) to coral red (>12 m/s).
    The dominant wind directions are SW and W, showing the highest frequencies (~22-25%).
    The radial axis displays percentage values (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) at 45-degree angle.
    A legend titled "Wind Speed" on the right side clearly identifies the 5 speed
    categories. The title "windrose-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top.

        comment: Polar chart - no traditional axis labels, but radial axis has % suffix
          which is informative. Direction labels serve as angular axis. No explicit

        comment: Shows variation in direction frequency (SW/W dominant), different

        comment: Uses go.Barpolar which is appropriate for wind rose, polar layout
          configuration, and generates both PNG and HTML for interactivity. Could
          further leverage Plotly's hover customization for speed/direction details.
  verdict: APPROVED
