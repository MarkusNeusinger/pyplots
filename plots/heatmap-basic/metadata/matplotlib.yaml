review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of TwoSlopeNorm for proper diverging color normalization centered
    at zero
  - Clever minor-tick grid technique for clean white cell separators — a distinctively
    matplotlib approach
  - Adaptive text styling (bold/large for strong correlations, smaller/dark for weak)
    creates effective visual hierarchy
  - Well-chosen realistic data scenario with clear department clustering patterns
  - Clean, well-structured code with appropriate comments
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels Department (row) and Department (column) are mechanical — could be
    more informative or simply Department on each axis
  - Some wasted canvas space due to colorbar placement creating asymmetric margins
  - Data storytelling could be enhanced — the clustering patterns (revenue/technical/admin
    departments) are present in the data but not explicitly highlighted for the viewer
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 department correlation matrix heatmap
    using the RdBu_r diverging colormap. Strong positive correlations appear in deep
    red (e.g., Sales-Marketing at 0.82), strong negative correlations in blue (e.g.,
    Finance-Dev at -0.65), and near-zero values in pale/white tones. All 64 cells
    contain numeric annotations formatted to two decimal places. The diagonal cells
    show 1.00 in dark red (self-correlation). White grid lines cleanly separate each
    cell. Strong correlations (|val| >= 0.6) use larger bold white text for emphasis;
    weaker correlations use smaller dark text. The title reads "heatmap-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. Y-axis is labeled "Department (row)" and X-axis "Department
    (column)". X-axis tick labels are rotated 45 degrees. A colorbar on the right
    displays "Correlation Coefficient" ranging from -1.00 to 1.00. The layout is square
    and well-filled with balanced proportions.
