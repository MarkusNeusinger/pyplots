review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Effective use of pygal style system with custom Style class
  - Good visual representation of stock price movement with appropriate transparency
  - Proper axis labeling with units
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - 'Missing critical spec feature: interactive range selector with preset ranges
    (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) and mini chart is not implemented'
  - X-axis labels overlap in places due to too many labels being shown
  - Legend positioning at bottom left is suboptimal
  image_description: The plot displays a filled area chart showing stock price data
    over approximately 2 years (Jan 2024 to Nov 2025). The chart uses a blue fill
    color (#306998 - Python blue) with semi-transparent opacity (approximately 40%).
    The price axis (Y-axis) ranges from approximately 120 to 235 USD and is labeled
    "Price (USD)". The X-axis shows month-year labels (e.g., "Jan 2024", "Feb 2024")
    which are rotated at 45 degrees and labeled "Date". The title "area-stock-range
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text. A legend labeled "Stock
    Price" appears at the bottom left corner. The chart effectively shows the stock's
    journey from ~150 USD at the start, dropping to a low of ~120 USD in early 2024,
    then consolidating before rallying to a peak of approximately 235 USD in mid-2025,
    before settling around 195 USD by the end of the displayed period. The filled
    area below the price line emphasizes the price movements well. Horizontal grid
    lines at regular intervals (every 10 USD) aid in reading values. The overall color
    scheme is clean with a white background and subtle gray grid lines.
