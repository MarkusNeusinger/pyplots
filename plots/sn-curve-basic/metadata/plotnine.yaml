review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adherence to specification with all required elements (reference lines,
    fit curve, scatter data, log scales)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic fatigue testing data using Basquin equation with appropriate scatter
  - Clear labeling with units on both axes
  - Good use of color for distinguishing reference lines
  weaknesses:
  - Grid theme configuration uses element_text instead of element_line for panel_grid
    properties (lines 99-102)
  - Data point markers (size=4) could be slightly larger for better visibility at
    full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) for steel fatigue
    testing. The chart uses logarithmic scales on both axes, with "Number of Cycles
    to Failure (N)" on the x-axis (ranging from ~10² to ~10⁸) and "Stress Amplitude
    (MPa)" on the y-axis (ranging from ~175 to ~600). A solid blue line represents
    the Basquin equation fit curve showing the expected stress-cycles relationship.
    Blue circular data points (with slight transparency) are scattered around the
    fit line, showing realistic scatter from multiple test specimens. Three horizontal
    dashed reference lines are included: a red dashed line at 550 MPa labeled "Ultimate
    Strength", an orange dashed line at 350 MPa labeled "Yield Strength", and a green
    dashed line at 250 MPa labeled "Endurance Limit". The title follows the required
    format: "sn-curve-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The plot uses a minimal theme
    with subtle gray gridlines.'
