review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution to achieve nested donut effect in pygal by compositing
    two separate pie charts
  - Consistent color families per department (blue, yellow, green, red) exactly as
    spec recommends
  - Professional budget allocation scenario that is immediately relatable
  - Values displayed with proper currency formatting ($XXK)
  - Generates both PNG static and HTML interactive versions
  - Title follows exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is somewhat small and could be larger for better readability
  - The PIL compositing approach adds code complexity that could benefit from comments
    explaining the technique
  image_description: 'The plot displays a nested donut chart with two concentric rings
    on a white background. The outer ring shows 12 budget subcategories (Salaries,
    Equipment, Training for Engineering; Advertising, Events, Content for Marketing;
    Infrastructure, Utilities, Maintenance for Operations; Commissions, Travel, Tools
    for Sales). The inner ring displays the 4 department totals: Engineering ($700K,
    blue), Marketing ($500K, yellow), Operations ($340K, green), and Sales ($360K,
    red). Each department uses a consistent color family - Engineering in blue shades,
    Marketing in yellow shades, Operations in green shades, and Sales in red/coral
    shades. Values are displayed in dollar format ($XXK). The title "donut-nested
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom lists all 12
    subcategories in 4 columns.'
