review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of step histogram with filled area for clear visualization of cumulative
    distribution
  - Smart percentile annotation positioning to avoid overlap (right-aligned for 75th/90th,
    left-aligned for 25th/50th)
  - Realistic exam score scenario with multi-modal distribution (combining normal
    distributions)
  - Appropriate color choices with good accessibility (blue primary, yellow reference
    lines)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or be more descriptive (e.g., "Exam Score (points)"
    or "Cumulative Probability")
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features like axhspan for percentile bands
    or secondary y-axis for counts
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram showing exam score distribution.
    The chart uses a blue (#306998) step function with a light blue filled area underneath.
    The x-axis shows "Exam Score" ranging from 0 to 100, and the y-axis shows "Cumulative
    Proportion" from 0.0 to 1.0. Yellow dashed reference lines mark the 25th, 50th,
    75th, and 90th percentiles with annotations showing the corresponding score values
    (58, 69, 82, and 88 respectively). The title follows the correct format "histogram-cumulative
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A legend in the lower right shows "Cumulative Distribution".
    The grid is subtle with dashed lines at alpha 0.3.

        comment: Uses matplotlib's hist() with cumulative and histtype parameters
          effectively, but could leverage more matplotlib-specific features like axhspan
          for percentile bands or twin axes
  verdict: APPROVED
