review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data choice: Tech skills survey provides relatable, realistic context
    with good frequency variation'
  - Clean word placement with no overlapping text and good use of prefer_horizontal=0.7
    parameter
  - Proper use of random_state=42 ensures reproducibility
  - Blues colormap provides colorblind-safe visualization with good contrast
  - High resolution output (4800x2700) with appropriate min/max font sizes (20-300)
  weaknesses:
  - Library Features score limited because WordCloud library does most of the work
    rather than matplotlib-specific features
  - Could benefit from slightly more diverse color usage while remaining accessible
  image_description: The word cloud displays tech industry skills with a white background
    and a blue color scheme (Blues colormap). The most prominent words are "Python",
    "JavaScript", "Data", "Machine Learning", "Cloud", and "Security" - displayed
    in large, dark blue text. Smaller words like "GraphQL", "Terraform", "Monitoring",
    "Performance" appear in lighter blue shades and smaller sizes. The title "Tech
    Skills Survey · wordcloud-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in a clean, readable font. Words are arranged in both horizontal and vertical
    orientations, filling the canvas nicely with good spacing. No overlapping text
    is visible.

        comment: Good use of generate_from_frequencies and colormap, but this is a
          combination library approach rather than pure matplotlib distinctive features
  verdict: APPROVED
