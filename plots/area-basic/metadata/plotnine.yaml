review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar with proper layering (geom_area + geom_line)
  - Realistic website traffic data with weekly cyclical pattern and upward trend
  - Semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.4) as recommended in spec for readability
  - Clean, minimal theme with subtle grid lines
  - Proper title format and legible text sizes throughout
  - Good use of scale_x_datetime for proper date formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Daily Visitors (count)" or "Date (2024)")
  - Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like stat_smooth for trend visualization
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024. The chart uses a blue color (#306998) with semi-transparent
    fill (alpha ~0.4) and a solid blue line on top. The X-axis displays dates from
    Jan 01 to Jan 29 with weekly intervals labeled (Jan 01, Jan 08, Jan 15, Jan 22,
    Jan 29). The Y-axis shows "Daily Visitors" ranging from 0 to 8000. The title "area-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The data shows a clear cyclical
    weekly pattern with peaks and troughs, overlaid with an upward trend, representing
    realistic website traffic patterns. Grid lines are subtle and horizontal only.
    The overall layout is clean with good proportions.
