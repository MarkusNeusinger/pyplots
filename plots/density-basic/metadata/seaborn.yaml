review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot with fill and rugplot combination for statistical
    visualization
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles with proper structure
  - Bimodal test score data effectively demonstrates distribution characteristics
  - Perfect title format and appropriate axis labels with units
  - Good visual design with subtle grid, appropriate transparency, and readable text
    sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Bimodality in data could be more pronounced - currently appears as a shoulder
    rather than two distinct peaks
  - Grid could use slightly lower alpha (0.2 instead of 0.3) for even more subtle
    appearance
  image_description: The plot displays a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve showing
    the distribution of test scores. The curve is filled with a semi-transparent blue
    color (#306998) and has a thicker outline. The plot shows a bimodal distribution
    with a main peak around 72-75 points and a secondary shoulder/peak around 88-90
    points. A rug plot is visible along the x-axis showing individual data points
    as small vertical lines. The title "density-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score (points)" and the y-axis is labeled
    "Density". A subtle dashed grid is present in the background. The layout is clean
    with good proportions in 16:9 aspect ratio.
