review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data transformation approach using melt() to create long-format data
    suitable for Altair declarative API
  - Clean normalization implementation allowing fair comparison across all dimensions
  - Good use of opacity (0.6) for handling 150 overlapping lines
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between species
  - Correct title format and professional axis labeling with units
  - Appropriate chart sizing (1500x850 with 3.0 scale factor) for target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Altair distinctive interactive features (tooltips, brush selection,
    or click interactions) that would make the parallel coordinates plot more exploratory
  - Dashed grid lines add visual noise in a line-heavy parallel coordinates visualization;
    a cleaner background would improve readability
