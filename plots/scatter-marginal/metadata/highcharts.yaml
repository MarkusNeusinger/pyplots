review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent axis alignment between main scatter and marginal histograms
  - Good use of multi-chart composition to achieve the marginal distribution layout
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with appropriate temperature/humidity correlation
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme with consistent styling across all chart panels
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Top-right corner is empty white space that could be utilized better
  - Could use Highcharts chart linking features for synchronized crosshairs/tooltips
  - Library version in header shows unknown instead of actual version
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with marginal histogram distributions.
    The main scatter plot occupies the lower-left area showing temperature (°C) on
    the x-axis (ranging ~10-38°C) vs. relative humidity (%) on the y-axis (ranging
    ~20-78%). A clear negative correlation is visible between temperature and humidity.
    The top marginal shows a histogram of temperature distribution with vertical blue
    bars, peaking around 23-27°C. The right marginal shows a horizontal histogram
    of humidity distribution, with most values concentrated in the 42-58% range. The
    title "scatter-marginal · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. All elements
    use a consistent blue color (#306998) with transparency. Axis labels include units.
    Grid lines are subtle dashed lines.
