review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions across plants (tight vs variable,
    high vs low quality)
  - Proper seaborn API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warning
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate jitter (0.3) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage distinctive seaborn features (e.g., could overlay with boxplot
    or violin for statistical summary)
  - Color palette includes two blue shades (Plant A and Plant C) that may be confused
    at a glance
