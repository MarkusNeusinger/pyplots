review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation for category readability
  - Clear point estimates with distinct yellow markers and blue confidence interval
    bars
  - Reference line at 75 adds valuable context for interpretation
  - Good use of Highcharts columnrange for confidence intervals combined with scatter
    for points
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow)
  - Realistic business scenario with department performance scores
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence intervals lack endpoint caps as mentioned in specification notes
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area for better visual cohesion
