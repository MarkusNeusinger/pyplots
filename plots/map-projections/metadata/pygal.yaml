review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to demonstrating projection concepts using Mercator distortion
    factors
  - Excellent use of pygal_maps_world World map chart
  - Clean, readable code with good comments explaining the data
  - Good diverging color scheme that visually conveys distortion levels
  - Well-organized legend with latitude band descriptions
  - Educational value showing how latitude affects map projection distortion
  weaknesses:
  - Missing graticule (latitude/longitude grid lines) as specified in requirements
  - No Tissot indicatrices to visualize distortion patterns
  - Spec requests multiple projections comparison - only shows one view
  - Title format includes extra prefix instead of clean spec-id format
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a world map using pygal_maps_world with countries colored according to their Mercator projection distortion levels. The map uses a Robinson-like pseudo-cylindrical projection typical of pygal. Four color-coded categories are shown:

    - Red/pink (Extreme >2.5×): Greenland (bright red), Russia, Canada, Nordic countries, UK
    - Peach/light orange (High 1.3-2.5×): USA, Chile, Argentina, France, Germany, Japan, China
    - Yellow/cream (Moderate 1.1-1.3×): South Africa, Egypt, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand
    - Green (Minimal <1.1×): Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia, Nigeria, DR Congo, Ecuador, and other equatorial countries

    The title reads "Mercator Projection Distortion · map-projections · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend at the bottom shows the four distortion categories. Country borders are visible with gray outlines. The map effectively illustrates how Mercator projection distorts land areas at different latitudes.
