review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette (Python blue, yellow, purple, cyan)
  - Clean implementation following Highcharts best practices with inline JS for headless
    rendering
  - Stack total labels above bars make cumulative values immediately visible
  - Individual segment data labels provide precise values within each component
  - Well-formatted tooltip showing both individual and total values
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears relatively small compared to the large 4800x2700 canvas -
    could benefit from larger itemStyle fontSize
  - Y-axis title appears slightly compressed/close to edge
  - Data shows uniform growth pattern across all components - more varied component
    trajectories would better demonstrate stacked chart capabilities
