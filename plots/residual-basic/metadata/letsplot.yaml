review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of core residual plot features including reference line
    and LOESS smoother
  - Good data generation with realistic heteroscedasticity and deliberately placed
    outliers for diagnostic interest
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels
  - Appropriate color choices for accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha value)
  - Data context is generic rather than demonstrating a specific domain application
