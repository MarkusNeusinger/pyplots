review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features with detailed hover tooltips showing
    paradigm, abstraction level, and type safety
  - Creative and educational data scenario using programming languages that developers
    can relate to
  - Good color palette with 8 distinct, colorblind-safe colors for paradigm categories
  - Clean KISS code structure with good organization and comments explaining coordinate
    adjustments
  - Proper title format and well-positioned legend with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - 'Text overlaps persist in several areas despite coordinate adjustments: Kotlin/Dart,
    Prolog/Clojure, JavaScript/Perl, Fortran/COBOL regions need further separation'
  - Legend uses Aa text markers which add visual clutter; would be cleaner with colored
    squares or circles
  - Axis labels lack parenthetical context (could add 0-10 scale indication)
  image_description: 'The plot displays programming languages positioned in a 2D space
    with "Level of Abstraction" (0-10) on the x-axis and "Type Safety" (0-10) on the
    y-axis. Each language name serves as a text label positioned at its coordinates.
    Languages are color-coded by paradigm category: Multi-paradigm (blue - Python,
    JavaScript, TypeScript), OOP (amber/yellow - Java, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Ruby, Dart),
    Systems (red - C++, Go, Rust, Assembly), Functional (green - Haskell, Scala, OCaml,
    F#, Elixir, Clojure, Erlang, Lisp, Prolog), Statistical (purple - R), Scientific
    (cyan - Julia, MATLAB, Fortran), Scripting (orange - Perl, PHP, Lua), and Legacy
    (gray - COBOL). The title "scatter-text · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top. A legend on the right shows all paradigm categories. The layout uses
    a clean white template with subtle grid lines. However, there are visible text
    overlaps in several areas: "Kotlin" and "Dart" overlap around (7, 7), "JavaScript"
    and "Perl" are very close around (7, 2.5), "Prolog" and "Clojure" overlap around
    (9, 6.5), and "Fortran" and "COBOL" overlap around (4, 5.5).'
