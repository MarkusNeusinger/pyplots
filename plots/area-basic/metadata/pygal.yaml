  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with deterministic data
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with convincing weekly cyclical patterns
  - 'Good use of pygal idioms: Style class, dict-based annotations, value_formatter'
  - Smart X-axis label spacing (every 5th day) preventing overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Data storytelling is effectively absent in the PNG output — the dict-based annotations
    for peak/low points only render on hover in SVG/HTML, not in the static image.
    Consider adding pygal secondary series or range indicators to highlight key data
    points visibly.
  - Visual refinement could be improved — default pygal axis chrome remains, and the
    foreground_subtle color (#999) could be lighter for more subtle gridlines.
  - The area fill, while semi-transparent, could benefit from a color gradient or
    a stronger visual treatment to better emphasize the volume aspect the spec describes.
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart on a white background. A
    single series in Python Blue (#306998) with semi-transparent fill (light blue,
    ~35% opacity) shows "Daily Website Visitors" over 30 days. Dark blue dots mark
    each data point along the filled area line. The X-axis is labeled "Day of Month"
    with tick labels at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. The Y-axis is labeled "Visitors"
    with values ranging from ~900 to ~2,150, formatted with comma separators. Horizontal
    gridlines in light gray aid value estimation. The title "Daily Website Visitors
    · area-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The data shows a realistic
    weekly cycle pattern with dips (likely weekends) and an overall upward trend,
    peaking around day 23-24 at ~2,150 visitors. No legend is shown (single series).
    The layout is clean with balanced margins and the chart fills the canvas well.
