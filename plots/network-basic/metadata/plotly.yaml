review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed layout algorithm from scratch
  - Node sizing based on degree effectively highlights well-connected individuals
  - Clean four-color palette that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of separate traces for legend grouping by community
  - Interactive HTML output generated alongside PNG
  - Hover text shows connection count for each node
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features (click-to-highlight neighbors,
    draggable nodes)
  - Network is positioned diagonally leaving some canvas corners empty
  - All community groups have exactly 5 members and 6 internal edges - more variation
    would better demonstrate the network concept
  image_description: 'The plot displays a network graph with 20 nodes representing
    people in a social network. Nodes are colored by community: blue (Group A - Alice,
    Bob, Carol, David, Eve), yellow (Group B - Frank, Grace, Henry, Ivy, Jack), green
    (Group C - Kate, Leo, Mia, Noah, Olivia), and orange/coral (Group D - Paul, Quinn,
    Ryan, Sara, Tom). Each node is a circular marker with the person''s name displayed
    inside in dark text. Gray edges connect related nodes both within and across communities.
    The title "Social Network · network-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. A legend labeled "Communities" in the top-left corner shows all four groups.
    The force-directed layout has positioned the network diagonally across the canvas,
    with communities clustering together while cross-group connections create bridges
    between them.'
