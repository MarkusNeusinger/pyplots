review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization clarity with well-separated species clusters visible in
    the parallel coordinates
  - Smart use of two-line x-axis labels showing both dimension names and original
    data ranges
  - Good transparency handling allows overlapping patterns to remain visible
  - Clean, readable code structure with proper data normalization
  - Colorblind-friendly palette choice
  weaknesses:
  - External data dependency (URL fetch) reduces reproducibility compared to inline
    data generation with fixed seed
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features rather than relying on lineplot
    as a workaround
