review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-positioned labels and counts in all 7 regions
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to construct Venn circles from coordinate
    data
  - Good color choices (blue/yellow/pink) with appropriate transparency for overlap
    visualization
  - Realistic and relatable data context (research field skills overlap)
  - Proper title format and square aspect ratio appropriate for the diagram type
  weaknesses:
  - File output requires os workaround to move files from lets-plot-images subdirectory
  - Could use geom_path instead of geom_polygon with size parameter for circle borders
    (minor)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a classic 3-circle Venn diagram showing overlapping
    research fields: "Machine Learning" (blue, top-left), "Statistics" (yellow, top-right),
    and "Data Engineering" (pink, bottom). Each circle has clear set labels positioned
    outside the circles. The exclusive region counts are displayed within each area:
    45 (ML only), 35 (Statistics only), 30 (Data Engineering only). Pairwise intersections
    show: 25 (ML & Statistics), 15 (ML & Data Engineering), 20 (Statistics & Data
    Engineering). The center triple intersection shows 10. The title "venn-basic ·
    lets-plot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The circles use transparency (alpha
    ~0.35) creating distinct visual blending in overlap regions. White borders separate
    the circles. The layout is square (1:1 aspect ratio) with good canvas utilization.'
