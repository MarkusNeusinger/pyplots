review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation of raincloud plot using pygal XY chart since
    pygal lacks native violin/raincloud support
  - Custom KDE computation using Silverman rule demonstrates sophisticated statistical
    approach
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, green) with consistent styling across
    cloud and rain elements
  - Box plot elements (quartiles, whiskers, caps, median) are well-constructed using
    coordinate-based drawing
  - Good data generation showing different distributions and outliers across treatment
    groups
  - Proper use of pygal Style class for consistent theming at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled making it harder to identify groups without looking at x-axis
    labels
  - Box plot median line could be more visually prominent to distinguish from quartile
    box
  - Jittered points are relatively small and could be larger for better visibility
    at full resolution
