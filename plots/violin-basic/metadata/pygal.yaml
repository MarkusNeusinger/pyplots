  strengths:
  - Excellent data quality with 4 distinct distribution shapes (bimodal, skewed, symmetric,
    wide) that showcase violin plot capabilities
  - Custom KDE implementation with Silverman bandwidth selection is mathematically
    sound
  - Clean harmonious 4-color palette with good contrast against white background
  - Informative tooltips with median/Q1/Q3 statistics leverage pygal interactive nature
  - Perfect code quality with clean flat structure and deterministic seed
  weaknesses:
  - Internal markers (IQR boxes and median lines) are too small and subtle to be easily
    distinguishable inside the violins
  - No visual hierarchy or emphasis — all violins have equal visual weight
  - Visual refinement could be pushed further — axis chrome and grid could be more
    polished
  - Library mastery limited by necessary manual construction since pygal lacks native
    violin type
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 violin shapes on a clean white background,
    each representing test score distributions for different class groups. The Honors
    violin (steel blue, #306998) is centered around 88-90% with a tight, symmetric
    shape. The Standard violin (salmon/orange, #E8875B) shows a right-skewed distribution
    peaking around 70-75%. The Remedial violin (teal green, #5BA37E) has the widest
    spread, extending from approximately 38% to 85% centered around 62%. The Advanced
    violin (gold, #C4A23D) clearly displays a bimodal shape with two distinct bulges
    around 75% and 93%. Each violin contains a small outlined quartile box (IQR) in
    a darker shade and a thin white median line. Subtle horizontal y-axis grid lines
    span the background. The title reads "violin-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the
    top, Y-axis is labeled "Test Score (%)" with values from 30% to 100%, and X-axis
    is labeled "Class Group" with category names beneath each violin. No legend is
    displayed. The overall aesthetic is clean and professional with a custom color
    palette.'

        comment: Font sizes explicitly set (title=72, labels=48, major_labels=42,

          font rendering.

        comment: Violin shapes clearly visible with 0.75 opacity. Internal markers
          (IQR box outlines and white median lines) are too small and subtle relative

        comment: Custom 4-color palette is harmonious and professional. White background
          with transparency creates soft look. Above defaults but not publication-ready.

        comment: Subtle y-axis-only grid, clean white background. Some refinement
          visible but axis lines remain prominent and chrome could be further minimized.

        comment: Data choice creates natural visual interest (bimodal, skewed, wide
          distributions) but no visual emphasis or hierarchy to guide viewer attention.
