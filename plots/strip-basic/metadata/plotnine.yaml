review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic medical research scenario with meaningful treatment
    groups
  - Good jitter width (0.25) spreads points without overlapping adjacent categories
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) handles point overlap well
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper reproducibility with seeds for both numpy and jitter
  - Data shows clear differences between treatment groups demonstrating the plot purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme alternates blue/yellow between adjacent categories creating visual
    confusion - a single color or sequential palette would be clearer
  - Grid lines are extremely subtle, almost invisible - could be slightly more visible
    (alpha 0.2-0.3)
