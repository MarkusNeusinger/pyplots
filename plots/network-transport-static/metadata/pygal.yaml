review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized nodes and readable edge labels
  - Proper handling of multiple routes between same stations using perpendicular offset
  - Color-coded route types with clear legend
  - Tooltips added for interactivity (SVG title elements)
  - Realistic regional rail scenario with plausible station names and times
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - High-quality PNG output at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper function normalize_to_svg() instead of inline calculations (minor
    KISS violation)
  - pygal is used primarily for styling (Style class) while actual visualization is
    custom SVG
  - Some edge labels may overlap slightly in dense areas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static transport network diagram representing
    a regional rail network with 10 stations (A through J). Stations are rendered
    as yellow circles (#FFD43B) with blue borders (#306998) containing a single letter
    ID, with the station name displayed on a white label below each node. The stations
    include: Central Station (A), North Park (B), East Harbor (C), South Gate (D),
    West Valley (E), Airport (F), University (G), Industrial Zone (H), Riverside (I),
    and Tech Campus (J). Routes are shown as directed edges with arrow markers indicating
    travel direction. Routes are color-coded by type: blue (RE - Regional Express),
    red (EX - Express), and green (LO - Local). Each route edge has a label showing
    the route ID and departure/arrival times (e.g., "RE 1 | 06:00 → 06:25"). The title
    "network-transport-static · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    "Regional Rail Network - Morning Schedule". A legend in the bottom-right corner
    explains the three route types. The background is white with a light gray plotting
    area.'

        comment: Uses pygal Style class for consistent styling, but actual visualization
          is custom SVG rather than pygal chart types. Valid approach since pygal
          lacks native network/graph support.
