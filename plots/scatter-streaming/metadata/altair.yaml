review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of dual encoding (opacity and color) to convey point recency/age
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with temperature-humidity correlation
  - Proper Altair declarative syntax with clean encoding specifications
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: labelExpr for legend customization, tooltips,
    scale domains'
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Some older points (opacity 0.2) may be too faint to see clearly against the white
    background
  - Fixed scale domain leaves some empty space on the right side of the plot
  image_description: The plot displays a streaming scatter plot with approximately
    200 data points representing simulated sensor readings. The X-axis shows "Temperature
    (°C)" ranging from about 19 to 31, and the Y-axis shows "Humidity (%)" ranging
    from 36 to 84. Points are rendered using a blue color scheme with a gradient from
    light (old data) to dark blue (new data), indicating recency through both color
    intensity and opacity. The title "scatter-streaming · altair · pyplots.ai" is
    clearly displayed at the top center. A vertical legend on the right labeled "Recency"
    shows the color gradient from "New" (dark blue) to "Old" (light blue). The data
    shows a positive correlation between temperature and humidity, with older (more
    transparent) points clustered in the lower-left region and newer (more opaque)
    points in the upper-right, simulating a data stream moving over time. The grid
    is subtle and the overall layout is clean.
