review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of an annotated heatmap in pygal, which does not natively
    support heatmaps
  - Beautiful diverging colormap (blue-white-red) appropriate for correlation data
  - Automatic contrast calculation for text annotations ensures readability on all
    background colors
  - Well-designed colorbar with proper labeling and gradient visualization
  - Realistic business metrics correlation data that demonstrates the visualization
    utility
  - Proper use of 3600x3600 square canvas which is ideal for symmetric matrices
  - Clean visual design with rounded corners on cells and subtle white borders
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a custom class structure (AnnotatedHeatmap) which violates the KISS
    principle, though this is arguably necessary since pygal has no native heatmap
    support
  - The colormap only shows positive correlations (0.28 to 1.00); for a fully diverging
    colormap demo, negative correlations would better showcase the blue end
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 6x6 correlation matrix heatmap showing relationships
    between business metrics: Revenue, Marketing, R&D Spend, Customers, Satisfaction,
    and Retention. The cells are colored using a diverging blue-white-red colormap
    where blue indicates lower correlations (~0.28), white/light colors represent
    mid-range values (~0.64), and red indicates strong positive correlations (1.00).
    Each cell displays its correlation value with 2 decimal places. The diagonal shows
    perfect correlations (1.00) in dark red. Row labels appear on the left, column
    labels are rotated 45° at the bottom. A vertical colorbar on the right shows the
    value scale from 0.28 to 1.00 labeled "Correlation". The title follows the required
    format at the top.'
  verdict: APPROVED
