review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of facet_wrap to create coordinated views in a static context
  - Good visual distinction between selected (blue, larger) and unselected (gray,
    smaller, transparent) points
  - Selection threshold clearly marked with yellow dashed line
  - Appropriate color scheme that is colorblind accessible
  - Clean subtitle shows selection criteria and count
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels overlap on the Y by Category panel (jittered categorical positions
    create decimal ticks)
  - All three views are scatter plots - spec suggests histogram and bar chart variety
  - Axis labels are empty strings - should have descriptive labels for each view
  - Panel strip titles could be more descriptive
  image_description: 'The plot displays three coordinated scatter plot views arranged
    horizontally using faceting. The title reads "linked-views-selection · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Selection: x > 4.5 (58/150 points selected)".
    The three panels are labeled "Scatter (x vs y)", "X vs Value", and "Y by Category".
    Selected points (those with x > 4.5) are rendered in blue (#306998) with higher
    opacity and larger size, while unselected points appear in light gray with reduced
    opacity. A yellow dashed vertical line at x=4.5 marks the selection threshold
    in the first two panels. The legend at the bottom shows "Selection" with two categories:
    "Selected" (blue) and "Unselected" (gray). The layout uses a minimal theme with
    subtle gray grid lines. The third panel "Y by Category" has overlapping x-axis
    tick labels (1.0, 1.8, 2.0, 2.8, 3.0) which appear crowded.'
