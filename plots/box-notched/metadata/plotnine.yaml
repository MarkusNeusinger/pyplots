review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering
  - Clear notches visible on all boxes enabling median comparison
  - Thoughtful data generation with different distributions per department (bimodal
    Sales, tight Support, outliers in HR)
  - Professional color palette starting with Python blue
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend disabled - consider keeping for accessibility if plot is viewed without
    context
  image_description: 'The plot displays a notched box plot showing Productivity Score
    (points) across 5 departments: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and HR.
    Each department has a distinct color: Engineering (Python blue #306998), Marketing
    (yellow #FFD43B), Sales (teal #4A90A4), Support (purple #8B5A8C), and HR (muted
    green #6B8E6B). The notches around medians are clearly visible on all boxes, with
    varying IQR widths showing different distributions. Outliers are displayed as
    individual points - Engineering has outliers at both high (~102) and low (~51)
    ends, while HR shows a low outlier (~40). The title "box-notched · plotnine ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels are "Department" (x-axis) and "Productivity
    Score (points)" (y-axis). The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gridlines.'
