review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimal design that matches spec requirements perfectly
  - Excellent use of custom Style for font sizing on large canvas
  - Realistic temperature data that clearly demonstrates seasonal trends
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good color choice with accessible contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom-left appears small and somewhat disconnected from the chart
  - Font sizes in the library rules suggest smaller values (28/18/16) but implementation
    uses larger (72/48/42) - while this works for the large canvas, it deviates from
    the template
  image_description: The plot displays a clean line chart showing monthly average
    temperatures for a temperate climate. A single soft blue line (#306998) connects
    12 data points across the months (Jan-Dec), forming the characteristic bell curve
    of seasonal temperature variation. Small circular markers are visible at each
    data point. The title "line-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    in gray text. The Y-axis is labeled "Temperature (°C)" with values ranging from
    ~2 to 22, and the X-axis is labeled "Month" with all 12 month abbreviations clearly
    displayed. Subtle horizontal dotted grid lines aid readability. A legend reading
    "Average Temperature" appears at the bottom left. The overall design is clean
    with a white background.

        comment: Uses custom Style class and pygal-specific options (show_dots, dots_size,
          stroke_style), but doesn't leverage tooltips or other interactive SVG features
          that make pygal distinctive
  verdict: APPROVED
