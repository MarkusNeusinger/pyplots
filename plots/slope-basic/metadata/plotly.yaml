review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color coding system using Python brand colors (blue for increase, yellow
    for decrease)
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Good use of Plotly annotation system for endpoint labels
  - Realistic business scenario with varied data showing both increases and decreases
  - Proper implementation of hover templates for interactive exploration
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend explaining what blue and yellow colors represent (increase vs
    decrease)
  - Some endpoint labels are positioned close together and could benefit from slight
    vertical adjustment to prevent near-overlap
  image_description: 'The plot displays a slope chart (slopegraph) comparing product
    sales between Q1 2024 and Q4 2024 for 10 tech products. Blue lines (#306998 -
    Python Blue) represent products with sales increases (8 products: Laptop Pro,
    Wireless Earbuds, Smart Watch, Gaming Mouse, Mechanical Keyboard, Webcam HD, USB
    Hub). Yellow/gold lines (#FFD43B - Python Yellow) represent products with sales
    decreases (3 products: Tablet Ultra, Portable SSD, Monitor Stand). Each product
    has labels at both endpoints showing the product name and sales value in $K. The
    chart uses a clean white template with subtle horizontal grid lines. The title
    "Product Sales Q1 vs Q4 · slope-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top. The Y-axis displays "Sales ($K)" ranging from approximately 30 to 310. The
    X-axis shows the two time points "Q1 2024" and "Q4 2024".'
