review:
  strengths:
  - Correct volcano plot structure with proper three-category classification (not
    significant, up-regulated, down-regulated)
  - Good use of colorblind-safe color palette (gray, red, blue)
  - Proper axis labels with scientific notation (Log₂, -Log₁₀)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Threshold lines are implemented (horizontal at y=1.3, vertical at x=±1)
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range extends to -5 when all data is above 0, wasting ~50% of vertical
    canvas space on empty area
  - Threshold lines are too faint/thin to be clearly visible - they should be more
    prominent dashed lines
  - Legend text appears small relative to canvas size and is positioned away from
    the data
  - No annotations for top significant genes as suggested in spec (optional but would
    improve)
