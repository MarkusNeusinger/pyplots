review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE from scratch using Silverman's bandwidth rule
  - Creative use of AreaSeries with gradient fill for appealing density visualization
  - Rug plot implemented using ScatterSeries with distinctive diamond markers
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow contrast)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Realistic data scenario (human heights with male/female distribution)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent (alpha 0.25 could be reduced to 0.2)
  - Rug plot markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at the plot scale
  - The bimodal distribution is not clearly visible as two distinct peaks (appears
    more as a single peak with shoulder)
  image_description: The plot displays a density curve (Kernel Density Estimation)
    representing height distribution in centimeters. The visualization uses a blue
    gradient-filled area chart transitioning from a darker blue (rgba ~0.6 opacity)
    at the top to a lighter blue (~0.1 opacity) at the bottom. The X-axis is labeled
    "Height (cm)" ranging from approximately 136 to 212, and the Y-axis is labeled
    "Density" ranging from 0 to about 0.041. A rug plot is displayed along the bottom
    using yellow diamond markers to show individual observations. The title "density-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. A legend in the
    top-right corner identifies "Density Curve" and "Observations (Rug)". The distribution
    shows a bimodal characteristic (combining simulated male/female heights) that
    manifests as a main peak around 168-170 cm with a shoulder extending toward higher
    values around 178-180 cm.
