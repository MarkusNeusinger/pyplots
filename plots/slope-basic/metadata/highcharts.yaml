review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with thick lines and large markers appropriate for the
    4800x2700 canvas
  - Color coding by direction (blue=increase, yellow=decrease) matches spec requirement
    and is colorblind-safe
  - Endpoint labels are well-formatted showing both entity name and value
  - Proper title format following pyplots convention
  - Clean, readable code structure following library guidelines
  - Correct Selenium/headless Chrome export pattern for Highcharts
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 0 but data ranges from 45-150, wasting vertical space that could
    better show the slope differences
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower opacity) to avoid competing with data
  - No explicit comment about deterministic data (minor)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a slope chart (slopegraph) comparing product
    sales between Q1 and Q4. Eight products (A through H) are shown with lines connecting
    their Q1 values (left) to Q4 values (right). Blue lines (#306998) indicate products
    that increased in sales (A, C, D, F, G), while yellow/gold lines (#FFD43B) indicate
    products that decreased (B, E, H). Each endpoint has a circular marker with labels
    showing the product name and value (e.g., "Product A: 85" on the left, "Product
    A: 110" on the right). The title "slope-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold, with subtitle "Product Sales: Q1 vs Q4 (thousands)" below.
    The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands)" ranging from 0 to 160 with dashed grid
    lines. The X-axis shows "Q1" and "Q4" labels at the bottom.'

        comment: Grid is dashed which is good, but legend is disabled; for slope charts
          without legend this is acceptable but loses 1pt; grid could be more subtle
