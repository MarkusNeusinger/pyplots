review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of a financial dashboard with four complementary views
    of the same dataset
  - Clean 2x2 CSS grid layout with consistent spacing and border styling
  - 'Good use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B, purple
    #9467BD)'
  - Correctly generates interactive HTML alongside PNG screenshot
  - Moving average calculation adds meaningful context to the price chart
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels on the price and volume charts appear small and rotated, reducing
    readability at full resolution
  - The categories approach for x-axis shows only every 10th day but data points are
    indexed 0-59, causing visual misalignment between labels and data
  - Legend on price chart is positioned at the bottom which takes extra space; consider
    placing it inside the chart or at the top
