review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme (redblue) properly centered at zero with domain
    [-1, 1]
  - Smart conditional text coloring (white on dark backgrounds, black on light) improves
    readability
  - Clean data generation approach creating valid symmetric correlation matrix
  - Good use of Altair's layered composition (heatmap + text)
  - Professional styling with white cell borders and bold fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis titles (could add "Variables" or similar descriptive label)
  - Triangle masking not implemented (spec mentions "consider masking upper or lower
    triangle")
  - Could add tooltips for interactivity since HTML is also saved
