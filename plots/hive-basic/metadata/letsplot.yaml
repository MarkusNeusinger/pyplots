review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept using lets-plot grammar of graphics
  - Bezier curve calculation for edges creates smooth, visually appealing connections
  - Comprehensive legend with three informative sections (Edge Type, Connections,
    Module Type)
  - Realistic software module dependency scenario matches spec applications exactly
  - Good use of color coding for both nodes and edges by module type
  - Clean radial axis layout with appropriate spacing (0.3-0.95 range)
  - Node sizing by degree effectively communicates connectivity importance
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text before the required format
  - Edge curves could be slightly less transparent in the center region where they
    overlap
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hive plot visualization for software module
    dependencies. Three radial axes extend from near the center: **Core** (pointing
    right/east), **Utility** (pointing upper-left), and **Interface** (pointing lower-left).
    Each axis has nodes (circles) positioned along it with sizes representing degree
    (number of connections). Core modules are shown in blue (#306998), Utility modules
    in yellow (#FFD43B), and Interface modules in green (#34A853). Curved Bezier edges
    connect the nodes, colored by type: blue for within-Core, yellow for within-Utility,
    green for within-Interface, and gray for between-axes connections. The title at
    the top reads "Software Module Dependencies · hive-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai".
    A comprehensive legend on the right shows Edge Type, Connections (size scale 2-8),
    and Module Type. The background is white with axis labels in bold black text near
    each axis terminus.'

          have appropriate alpha (0.6) for visibility without overwhelming. Slightly

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, geom_path for curves, geom_point with size mapping,
          theme_void for clean look. Could leverage more lets-plot specific features
          like tooltips.
