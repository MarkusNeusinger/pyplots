review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 3D wireframe using 2D Bokeh with manual projection
    mathematics
  - Clean wireframe rendering with appropriate line width and alpha for visibility
  - Good use of Python Blue color that maintains brand consistency
  - Creative approach to render 3D visualization in a 2D-only library
  - Correct title format and good canvas utilization
  - Code includes thorough axis visualization with tick marks and labels
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels and tick marks defined in code are rendering too small or not visible
    in the final output; the labels appear as just single letters (X, Y, Z) rather
    than the full descriptive text
  - The custom 3D axis lines defined in code are not clearly visible in the output
    - they may be too short or obscured
  - Tick mark values appear to not be rendering visibly - font sizes may need adjustment
    despite being set to 24pt and 36pt
