review:
  strengths:
  - Clean visual design with appropriate transparency for overlapping regions
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible (blue, yellow, green)
  - All seven regions are properly labeled with correct counts
  - Proportional circle sizing attempts to represent set sizes
  - Realistic data scenario (research disciplines) that is neutral and relatable
  - Proper title format following the specification
  weaknesses:
  - Venn diagram is positioned in upper portion of canvas with significant empty space
    at the bottom; should be vertically centered
  - Text could be larger for better legibility at full resolution; font sizes (28-32pt)
    are on the smaller side for a 3600x3600 canvas
  - Set labels could be more prominently positioned
