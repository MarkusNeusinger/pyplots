review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  - Good use of connecting lines (arrowstyle="-") from labels to data points as spec
    recommends
  - Realistic business context with tech companies plotting revenue vs market cap
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Smart axis limit expansion to accommodate labels without cutting them off
  weaknesses:
  - Label overlap occurs in clustered data regions (AILabs/DevOps and CyberSec/SmartHub
    areas) - consider using adjustText library or smarter label positioning
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features - mostly relies on matplotlib for annotations
  - Fixed offset positioning strategy does not adapt to prevent overlaps in dense
    regions
