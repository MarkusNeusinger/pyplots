review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements violin-swarm hybrid visualization using pygal XY chart
  - Manual KDE calculation is mathematically correct using Silverman rule
  - Swarm positioning algorithm respects violin boundaries
  - Clean visual separation between the four experimental conditions
  - Appropriate use of transparency (opacity 0.35) for violin fills
  weaknesses:
  - Swarm point colors do not contrast with violin fills as recommended in spec
  - Legend is redundant and confusing - duplicates x-axis labels
  - Contains helper functions violating KISS principle
  - Font sizes could be larger for better readability at 4800x2700 canvas
  - Does not leverage pygal distinctive features (interactivity, tooltips)
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin-swarm combinations representing
    reaction times across four experimental conditions (Control, Low Dose, Medium
    Dose, High Dose). Each violin has a semi-transparent fill showing the distribution
    density - Control is light blue, Low Dose is orange, Medium Dose is yellow, and
    High Dose is cyan. Individual data points are overlaid as colored dots: green
    for Control, purple for Low Dose, pink for Medium Dose, and brown for High Dose.
    The violins are mirrored showing kernel density estimation with varying widths.
    The title "violin-swarm · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis shows
    "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from ~100 to 600, and the X-axis shows "Experimental
    Condition" with the four category labels. A legend appears at the bottom showing
    all four condition names.'
