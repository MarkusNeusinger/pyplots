review:
  strengths:
  - Clean semicircular layout with seats properly arranged in concentric arcs
  - Parties correctly fill left-to-right following political spectrum convention
  - Excellent color palette with good accessibility and contrast
  - Legend includes seat counts as specified
  - Majority threshold annotation provides useful context
  - White seat borders enhance individual seat visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small relative to the large canvas size (3600x3600px)
  - Significant unused whitespace above the semicircle reduces canvas utilization
  - Missing visual indicator for majority threshold (e.g., an arc or line at 50%+1)
  - Could benefit from Bokeh HoverTool for interactive seat information
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    400 seats arranged in 8 concentric arcs. Five political parties are represented
    with distinct colors arranged left-to-right: Progressive Alliance (blue, 85 seats),
    Green Coalition (green, 45 seats), Center Party (yellow, 120 seats), Conservative
    Union (red, 95 seats), and Liberal Democrats (orange, 55 seats). Each seat is
    rendered as an individual dot with white borders. The title "parliament-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Below the semicircle, annotations show
    "Majority threshold: 201 seats" and "Total: 400 seats". A horizontal legend at
    the bottom displays all party names with their seat counts.'
