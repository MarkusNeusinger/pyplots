review:
  strengths:
  - Clean semicircular arrangement of seats in concentric arcs with proper spacing
  - Effective use of XY chart to create custom parliament visualization despite pygal
    limitations
  - Majority threshold line clearly indicates the 50%+1 requirement
  - Legend includes seat counts for each party in a clean format
  - Good color contrast between most parties using colorblind-safe palette
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra text before the required spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
    format
  - Teal and light blue colors for Reform Party and Green Coalition are too similar
    and may cause confusion
  - Does not leverage pygal distinctive features - implementation works around library
    limitations
