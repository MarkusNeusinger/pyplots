review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements alternating blue/gray color scheme for odd/even chromosomes
  - Uses pygal interactive tooltip feature with detailed SNP information (position,
    -log10 p-value)
  - Good custom styling with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Proper data generation with realistic GWAS simulation including significant peaks
    on specific chromosomes
  - Title follows the correct format specification
  weaknesses:
  - Threshold lines (genome-wide significance at 7.3 and suggestive at 5.0) are not
    visible as horizontal lines in the rendered plot
  - X-axis shows numeric genomic position (Mb) instead of chromosome labels (1-22)
    centered below each chromosome region as specified
  - Legend is not visible in the PNG output
  - Contains a helper function position_to_chromosome() which violates the KISS principle
    of no functions/classes
