review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the sigmoid curve with proper logistic regression
    fitting using sklearn
  - Beautiful color scheme with accessible blue/yellow contrast
  - 'All spec requirements met: jittered points, CI band, decision threshold, accuracy
    annotation'
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for data density
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Study Hours (h)" would be more informative)
  - Y-axis jitter causes some points to appear at negative values, which is technically
    outside the [0,1] probability range
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover templates
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression curve showing the relationship
    between study hours (x-axis, ranging 0-12) and probability of passing (y-axis,
    0-1). Data points are clearly visible with two distinct classes: blue markers
    for "Failed (0)" clustered near y=0 with lower study hours, and yellow/gold markers
    for "Passed (1)" clustered near y=1 with higher study hours. The characteristic
    S-shaped sigmoid curve is rendered as a solid blue line (~4px width) transitioning
    smoothly from near-zero probability at low study hours to near-one at high study
    hours. A light blue semi-transparent confidence interval band surrounds the curve.
    A gray dashed horizontal line marks the decision threshold at probability=0.5.
    The legend in the upper-left shows all five elements (95% CI, Logistic Curve,
    Decision Threshold, Failed, Passed). An annotation box in the lower-right displays
    "Accuracy: 90.7%". The plot uses the plotly_white template with subtle gridlines.'
