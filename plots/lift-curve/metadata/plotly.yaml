review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format and text sizing throughout
  - Well-implemented hover templates with informative formatting
  - Clear annotation highlighting the key 10% lift metric
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic customer response model scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible for better
    readability
  - Marker density in early percentages could be reduced for cleaner visualization
