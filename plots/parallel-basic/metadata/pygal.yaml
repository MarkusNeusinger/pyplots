review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using blue, yellow, and teal that clearly distinguishes
    species
  - Clever use of mean lines (thicker) overlaid with individual observations to show
    both aggregate trends and data spread
  - Proper normalization of data to 0-1 scale for fair cross-dimension comparison
  - Uses real Iris dataset providing authentic scientific context
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data dictionary and computed normalization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color boxes display as gray squares instead of showing the actual species
    colors (pygal limitation with unlabeled series)
  - Title format should be "parallel-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" with descriptive
    subtitle, not "Iris Flower Measurements · parallel-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
  - Grid lines are barely visible - should increase guide visibility for better readability
