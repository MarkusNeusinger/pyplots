review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using pygal XY chart to construct ternary plot from scratch
  - Proper ternary coordinate transformation mathematics
  - Clean grid lines at 20% intervals with dashed styling
  - Realistic soil composition domain with recognizable soil type names
  - Good use of SVG manipulation for vertex labels
  - Tick marks along edges as spec suggests
  weaknesses:
  - Missing percentage labels along triangle edges to aid reading proportions
  - Legend includes unnecessary structural elements instead of data-relevant information
  - Contains helper function violating KISS structure requirement
  - No np.random.seed(42) statement for reproducibility convention
