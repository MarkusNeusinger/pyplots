review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to implement Venn diagram in pygal which lacks native Venn support
  - All 7 regions correctly calculated and labeled with appropriate counts
  - Good use of transparency for visualizing overlaps
  - Appropriate color scheme (Python blue/yellow + green) with good contrast
  - Square format (3600x3600) is well-suited for Venn diagrams
  - Legend includes set sizes which is helpful context
  weaknesses:
  - Set labels "Product A" and "Product B" are cut off at canvas edges - need to adjust
    label positions
  - Complex SVG string manipulation deviates from KISS principle
  - Manual text injection into SVG is fragile and not using pygal native capabilities
