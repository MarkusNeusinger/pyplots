review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PCA biplot showing both scores and loading vectors
  - Uses Highcharts SVG renderer effectively to draw custom arrow elements
  - Colorblind-safe palette with clear species differentiation
  - Proper axis labels with variance explained percentages
  - Well-scaled loading vectors that are visible alongside score points
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed set (though data is deterministic from sklearn)
  - Grid lines could be more subtle
  - Could leverage more Highcharts interactive features like tooltips on loading arrows
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot using the Iris dataset with 150
    observations colored by species. Three species are shown: Setosa (blue), Versicolor
    (yellow), and Virginica (purple). The scatter points represent observation scores
    in the PC1-PC2 space. Four red loading vectors (arrows) originate from the origin,
    representing the four Iris features: Sepal Width (pointing upper-right), Sepal
    Length (pointing right and slightly up), Petal Width and Petal Length (both pointing
    right near the PC1 axis). The axes are labeled with variance explained: PC1 (73.0%)
    on x-axis and PC2 (22.9%) on y-axis. The title reads "Iris PCA · biplot-pca ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai". A legend is positioned on the right side showing the
    three species. Grid lines are subtle and gray reference lines mark the origin.'
