review:
  strengths:
  - Clean circular vortex pattern clearly demonstrates streamline flow visualization
  - Good use of plotly figure_factory.create_streamline function for specialized streamline
    plots
  - Appropriate density parameter (1.5) provides balanced coverage without overcrowding
  - Good title formatting following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Subtle grid styling with zeroline emphasis provides good reference
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar for Velocity Magnitude appears in rendered image despite code specifying
    uniform color - this inconsistency is confusing
  - X-axis range extends significantly beyond the data range (-6 to 6 vs data -3 to
    3), creating wasted horizontal space
  - Axis labels in rendered image lack the (dimensionless) units shown in code
