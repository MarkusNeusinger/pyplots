review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent colorblind-safe color scheme (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Clear zero baseline with prominent plotLine
  - Data labels on each bar improve readability
  - Properly sorted data from highest positive to lowest negative
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of horizontal bar orientation for readable category labels
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis title lacks units (could be "Net Satisfaction Score (%)")
  - Bars could be slightly thicker (pointWidth) to better fill the vertical space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing "Department
    Net Satisfaction Scores". Ten department categories are listed on the y-axis (Customer
    Service, IT Support, Sales, Marketing, Finance, Operations, HR, R&D, Legal, Logistics).
    Bars extend from a central zero baseline - positive values (blue/teal color #306998)
    extend to the right, negative values (yellow/gold color #FFD43B) extend to the
    left. A clear vertical black line marks the zero baseline. Each bar has a data
    label showing its value. The title follows the correct format "bar-diverging ·
    highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Department Net Satisfaction Scores".
    The x-axis ranges from -50 to 60 with clear tick labels.'
