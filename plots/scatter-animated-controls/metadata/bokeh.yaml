review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Gapminder-style visualization with realistic country development data
  - 'Good use of Bokeh interactive features: CustomJS animation, slider, play/pause
    button, hover tooltips'
  - Year label watermark clearly visible in the plot as specified
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good color palette with 5 distinct region colors
  - Appropriate bubble sizing based on population
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in PNG export is extremely small and nearly illegible despite code setting
    larger font sizes - appears cut off in top right corner
  - Legend positioning and sizing need adjustment for static PNG export to match the
    intended 4800x2700 canvas
