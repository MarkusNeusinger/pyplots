review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS flat structure without functions or classes (addressed previous feedback)
  - Excellent custom implementation using geom_polygon for smooth curved ribbons with
    easing
  - Professional color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic e-commerce customer journey scenario with meaningful category names
  - Labels include counts for quantitative context
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - No text overlap with alternating label positions
  weaknesses:
  - Category label text could be slightly larger (size 14 → 16) for optimal readability
    at 4800×2700
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel categories diagram with 4 vertical
    dimensions (Channel, Product, Size, Outcome) connected by smooth curved ribbons.
    The ribbons are colored by acquisition channel: blue (#306998) for Online, green
    (#27AE60) for Store, and yellow (#FFD43B) for Mobile. Each category node is rendered
    as a dark blue-gray rectangle with labels showing the category name and count
    in parentheses (e.g., "Online (270)", "Completed (579)"). Dimension headers appear
    in bold at the top of each vertical axis. The legend at the bottom shows "Acquisition
    Channel" with the three color mappings. The ribbons use 50% alpha transparency
    allowing overlapping flows to be distinguished.'

        comment: Title and dimension headers are clearly readable. Category labels
          are readable but could be slightly larger for optimal viewing at full resolution

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (geom_polygon, geom_rect, geom_text, theme_minimal)
          appropriately, but this is a custom implementation rather than a native
          lets-plot parallel categories geom
  verdict: APPROVED
