review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Bollinger Bands with all three components clearly
    differentiated (ribbon fill, dashed bands, dotted SMA, solid price)
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach using layer composition with geom_ribbon and
    multiple geom_line calls
  - Well-chosen color scheme with yellow price line contrasting against blue bands
    for clear visual distinction
  - Realistic data generation including volatility clusters that demonstrate band
    expansion/contraction
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output following plotnine guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the different line types (Close Price, 20-Day SMA,
    Upper/Lower Bands) - this is important for a financial indicator chart
  - Grid styling uses element_line with alpha parameter which may not work as expected
    in all plotnine versions
  image_description: The plot displays a Bollinger Bands indicator chart with a light
    blue (#306998) semi-transparent ribbon showing the volatility envelope between
    the upper and lower bands. The upper and lower bands are rendered as dashed blue
    lines at the edges of the ribbon. A dotted blue line in the center represents
    the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The close price is prominently displayed
    as a solid yellow/gold (#FFD43B) line that moves within and occasionally touches
    the bands. The X-axis shows dates from Feb 2024 to Jun 2024 with monthly labels
    rotated 45 degrees. The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging from approximately
    80 to 112. The title correctly follows the format "indicator-bollinger · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai". The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines. The
    layout is well-balanced with the chart filling a good portion of the 16:9 canvas.

        comment: Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_ribbon, geom_line,
          aes mappings, and theme customization; could leverage scale_color_manual
