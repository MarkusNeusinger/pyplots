review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color contrast
  - LOWESS curve is visually distinct and captures the complex non-linear pattern
    smoothly
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code using declarative layer composition
  - Proper use of frac=0.3 for balanced smoothness as specified
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for the data density (200 points)
  - Canvas utilization and layout are well balanced
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic rather than having real-world context with units
  - No interactive features like tooltips or zoom added despite Altair strength in
    interactivity
  - Markers use outline style which can be slightly less visible than filled markers
  image_description: 'The plot shows a scatter plot with LOWESS regression on a white/light
    gray background. Blue circular markers (outline only, Python blue #306998) represent
    200 data points showing a complex non-linear pattern - an initial rise, a peak
    around x=2.5-3, a dip around x=5-6, then a steep rise towards x=10. A thick yellow/gold
    LOWESS curve (#FFD43B) smoothly traces through the data, capturing the sine wave
    + linear trend pattern. The title "scatter-regression-lowess · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in black text. X-axis is labeled "Independent Variable (x)"
    ranging 0-10, Y-axis is labeled "Dependent Variable (y)" ranging -1 to 9. Subtle
    grid lines are visible. The plot uses good canvas utilization with proper margins.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative layering well; however, LOWESS is computed
          externally via statsmodels rather than using native Altair transforms. This
          is acceptable since Altair doesn't have built-in LOWESS, but no interactive
          features (tooltips, zoom) were added.
  verdict: APPROVED
