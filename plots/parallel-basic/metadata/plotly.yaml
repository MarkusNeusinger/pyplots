review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Iris dataset as a realistic, well-understood multivariate example
  - Clean three-species color coding makes patterns immediately visible
  - Proper axis labeling with units (cm) throughout
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good font sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Appropriate use of colorbar with categorical labels instead of continuous scale
    interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Could add alpha/opacity to lines for better handling of overlapping paths when
    species overlap
  - Missing explicit Plotly interactivity configuration (hover templates, axis brushing
    hints) that would showcase library strengths
  - Yellow-green color distinction in colorscale may be challenging for some colorblind
    users; consider using a more distinct three-color discrete palette
