review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of the efficient frontier concept with clear distinction
    between the frontier curve and random portfolios
  - Good use of color coding to show Sharpe ratio categories (terciles)
  - Special portfolios (Min Variance, Max Sharpe) are prominently marked with larger
    dot sizes
  - Appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean separation of data generation and visualization code
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart for scatter/line combination
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at the bottom appears relatively small compared to other text elements
  - The Sharpe ratio ranges in legend labels (0.66-0.68) are very narrow, making categories
    hard to distinguish conceptually
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization on a white background. The X-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation)"
    ranging from 12.0% to 23.0%, and the Y-axis shows "Expected Return" ranging from
    0.10 to 0.16. Three groups of scatter points represent portfolios categorized
    by Sharpe ratio: blue points for "Low Sharpe (<0.66)", yellow/orange points for
    "Mid Sharpe (0.66-0.68)", and green points for "High Sharpe (≥0.68)". The efficient
    frontier is drawn as a dark black curved line connecting optimal portfolios from
    the lower-left to upper-right. Two special markers are clearly visible: a large
    purple dot at the bottom-left (~12.5% risk, ~0.098 return) marking the "Min Variance"
    portfolio, and a large red dot (~14.7% risk, ~0.121 return) marking the "Max Sharpe"
    portfolio. The legend is positioned at the bottom with 6 items displayed in a
    horizontal row. The title "frontier-efficient · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top.'

        comment: Uses pygal XY chart, custom Style, stroke_style for line customization,
          legend placement, and value formatters. Good but could leverage more interactive
          features.
