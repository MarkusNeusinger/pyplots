review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent split violin implementation with halves meeting cleanly at the center
    line
  - White quartile markers (median solid, Q1/Q3 dashed) provide clear statistical
    reference within each violin
  - HoverTool integration provides interactive statistics (median, Q1, Q3, sample
    size) for each violin half
  - Blue/yellow color scheme is visually appealing and highly accessible for colorblind
    users
  - Realistic employee training satisfaction scenario makes the visualization immediately
    understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label text appears slightly smaller relative to x-axis label at display
    resolution
  - Bokeh toolbar icons visible on right edge slightly detract from clean presentation
  - Legend glyph boxes are relatively small compared to the large canvas size
  image_description: 'The plot displays four split violin plots arranged horizontally
    across departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). Each violin is split
    into two halves: the left side (Python Blue/steel blue, #306998) represents "Before
    Training" and the right side (Python Yellow/gold, #FFD43B) represents "After Training".
    The y-axis shows "Satisfaction Score (1-10)" ranging from about 1 to 10. Each
    violin half contains white horizontal lines indicating quartile markers - solid
    line for median, dashed lines for Q1 and Q3. A legend in the top-left corner identifies
    the two groups. The title "violin-split · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top. The background is a light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal
    grid lines.'
