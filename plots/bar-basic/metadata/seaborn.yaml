review:
  strengths:
  - 'Effective data storytelling: descending sort + annotations + color emphasis creates
    a clear ranking narrative'
  - Cohesive blue monochromatic palette with intentional emphasis hierarchy (top/default/bottom)
  - Clean code structure using seaborn's hue semantic for conditional bar coloring
    — idiomatic pattern
  - All font sizes explicitly configured for the target 4800×2700 resolution
  - 'Spec fully satisfied: consistent bar widths, value labels, color highlighting,
    adequate spacing'
  weaknesses:
  - The lightest emphasis bar (#C0D6E4 for 'bottom') nearly disappears against the
    white background — needs slightly more contrast
  - bbox_inches='tight' trims the canvas to 4678×2582 instead of the target 4800×2700,
    causing uneven margins
  - Middle-range bars (134, 95, 73, 62) could use slightly more varied values to better
    demonstrate the full range of a bar chart
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 8 product categories
    sorted in descending order by sales. The tallest bar (Electronics, 218 units)
    is rendered in dark navy blue (#306998), the shortest bar (Books, 41 units) in
    a very light blue-gray (#C0D6E4), and the remaining 6 bars in a consistent medium
    blue (#7BAFD4). Bold value labels appear above each bar. Two arrow annotations
    highlight the top seller ("Top seller — 218 units" in dark navy) and lowest performer
    ("Lowest — 41 units" in muted gray). The title reads "bar-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    in medium weight. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" and the y-axis "Sales
    (units)". Top and right spines are removed. A subtle y-axis grid with low alpha
    is visible behind the bars.
