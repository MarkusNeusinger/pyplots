review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent decision boundary visualization with clear class separation using make_moons
    data
  - Comprehensive legend showing class regions, correctly classified points, and misclassified
    points with distinct markers
  - Accuracy metric displayed prominently in upper-left corner adds value
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot for training points overlay with appropriate styling
  - Clean color scheme with blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) provides good contrast
    and accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (Feature X1/X2 rather than describing the specific feature
    dimensions)
