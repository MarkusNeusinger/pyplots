review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including threshold lines with
    dashed styling
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types (:Q, :N)
  - Biologically realistic data generation with correlation between fold change and
    significance
  - Good use of Unicode subscripts in axis labels (Log₂, Log₁₀)
  - Proper color scheme distinguishing up-regulated (red), down-regulated (blue),
    and non-significant (gray)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use Altair interactive selection features for highlighting genes by category
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (e.g., using orange instead of
    red)
