review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Fourier series implementation for Andrews curves transformation
  - Clear visual separation between iris species demonstrating the clustering capability
  - Proper data normalization using StandardScaler as recommended in spec
  - Clean, declarative Altair code with appropriate encoding types
  - Title format follows the required spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern with
    informative subtitle
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.4) for overlapping curves as recommended
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could benefit from a semi-transparent background for better contrast against
    the curves
  - Yellow color (#FFD43B) could be slightly less bright for better visibility on
    white background
  - Could add tooltips to enable interactive exploration of individual observations
