review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of file system storage hierarchy as a realistic, relatable data
    scenario
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme using blue and yellow tones
  - Clean circle packing implementation with proper size proportionality
  - Effective use of Plotly shape and annotation features for custom visualization
  - Interactive hover functionality adds value to the HTML output
  - Labels clearly show category names and sizes in MB
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra prefix before the required format
  - Leaf-level nodes (individual files) are not visible in the rendered output
  - Helper functions violate the KISS principle (should be flat script structure)
  - Some minor text overlap between subcategory and category labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circle packing chart visualizing file storage
    hierarchy. There are 4 main category circles arranged in a 2x2 grid pattern: **Documents**
    (blue, 520 MB), **Media** (yellow, 1070 MB), **Projects** (blue, 500 MB), and
    **System** (yellow, 280 MB). Each category contains nested subcategory circles
    with labels and values (e.g., Reports 180, Photos 340, Videos 450). The title
    reads "Storage Analysis · circlepacking-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top.
    Colors alternate between blue (#306998/#4B8BBE) and yellow (#FFD43B) for categories,
    with lighter shades for subcategories. White borders clearly separate hierarchy
    levels.'
