review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of area-based size scaling as spec requires
  - Size legend clearly communicates bubble size meaning with three reference values
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.6) and edge colors to distinguish overlapping
    bubbles
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Proper font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without contextual units despite code
    comments mentioning company metrics
  - Size distribution appears somewhat random rather than showing interesting patterns
    across the X-Y space
  image_description: The plot shows a bubble chart with approximately 50 data points
    displayed as semi-transparent blue circles (#306998) with darker blue edges (#1a3d5c).
    The bubbles vary significantly in size, representing a third variable. The X axis
    ranges from ~10 to 100, labeled "X Value", and the Y axis ranges from ~10 to 100,
    labeled "Y Value". There is a clear positive correlation between X and Y values.
    A size legend in the upper left corner shows three reference bubble sizes (100,
    250, 500) with title "Size Value". The title reads "bubble-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. A subtle dashed grid (alpha ~0.3) is visible
    in the background. The bubbles use alpha=0.6 transparency which allows overlapping
    bubbles to be distinguished.

        comment: Bubble sizes are well-adapted with good alpha (0.6) for 50 points,
          though some bubble overlap in the lower-left region makes individual bubbles
          harder to distinguish

        comment: Uses ax.scatter with proper size scaling and edge colors. Basic but
          correct matplotlib usage. Could leverage colormap or additional matplotlib
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
