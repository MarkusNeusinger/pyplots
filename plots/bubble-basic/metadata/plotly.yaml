review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title and axis labeling with proper units following spec format exactly
  - Well-implemented size legend with representative market share values (5%, 15%,
    30%)
  - Professional business context (company metrics) matching spec applications
  - Area-based bubble scaling as spec recommends (normalized size calculation)
  - Clean, readable code structure with good transparency (0.6) for overlapping bubbles
  - Rich hover templates showing all three variables
  weaknesses:
  - Size legend bubbles in Plotly appear slightly misaligned visually (all same visual
    size in legend due to scaling)
  - Could use color gradient based on a fourth variable to showcase Plotly color mapping
    capabilities
  - Grid lines at 0.1 alpha are barely visible - could be slightly more prominent
    (0.2-0.3)
