review:
  strengths:
  - All three MACD components (MACD line, signal line, histogram) clearly displayed
  - 'Correct color coding: green for positive histogram, red for negative histogram'
  - Zero reference line present as dashed gray line for crossover identification
  - Standard MACD parameters (12, 26, 9) documented in legend
  - Clean, readable code with proper EMA calculations
  - Good use of date_range for realistic trading day simulation (business days freq=B)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use annotations to highlight specific crossover signals (buy/sell points)
  - Histogram bar width could be slightly wider for better visibility at this data
    density
  - Color accessibility could be improved by using a non-red/green palette for histogram
    (e.g., blue/orange)
  image_description: The plot displays a MACD technical indicator chart with three
    components over approximately 6 months of trading data (July 2024 to January 2025).
    The MACD line (blue, linewidth 2.5) shows the difference between 12-day and 26-day
    EMAs, oscillating between approximately -2.7 and +1.2. The Signal line (yellow/gold,
    linewidth 2.5) follows as a smoothed 9-day EMA of MACD. The histogram bars show
    the MACD-Signal difference, colored green (#2ECC71) for positive values and red
    (#E74C3C) for negative values, with alpha=0.7 transparency. A gray dashed zero
    reference line marks the center. The title correctly displays "indicator-macd
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in large font. Axis labels "Date" and "MACD Value"
    are clearly visible. The legend is positioned in the upper left. X-axis dates
    are rotated 45 degrees for readability. Grid lines are subtle with alpha=0.3.
