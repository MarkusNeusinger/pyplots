review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features implemented (270-degree layout,
    concentric rings, sector divisions, ring fills, dual-encoding with color + shape)
  - 'Realistic and thoughtful data: 25 real-world technology items with plausible
    ring/sector assignments that tell a coherent innovation strategy story'
  - Good use of Altair interactive capabilities (hover selection, conditional sizing,
    tooltips) with HTML export alongside static PNG
  - Subtle ring tinting with graded opacity adds visual depth and separates time horizons
    effectively
  weaknesses:
  - 'Label overlaps in several areas: Edge Computing/FinOps Tools merge, Neuro-symbolic
    AI/AGI Frameworks crowd at right edge, AI Code Review/Vision Models too close
    — increase angular/radial separation or reduce item label font to gain spacing
    then increase label offset'
  - Item label fontSize of 14pt is slightly small for the 3600x3600 canvas — increasing
    to 16-18pt would improve readability
  - Bottom portion of canvas (below ring labels, above legend) has significant empty
    space that reduces layout balance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree radial innovation radar chart
    on a square canvas. Four concentric rings represent time horizons: Adopt (innermost,
    darkest blue tint), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost, lightest tint). Four angular
    sectors divide the arc: AI & ML (right, blue markers), Cloud & Infra (upper right,
    orange markers), Data Engineering (upper left, green markers), and Security (lower
    left, purple markers). Each of the 25 technology items is plotted as a colored
    marker with a nearby text label. Marker shapes encode rings: circles for Adopt,
    diamonds for Trial, triangles for Assess, squares for Hold. Spoke lines separate
    sectors, arc lines mark ring boundaries, and subtle blue ring fills decrease in
    opacity outward. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold) appear in the bottom
    gap of the 270-degree arc. A two-row legend at the bottom shows Sector colors
    and Ring shapes. The title reads "radar-innovation-timeline · altair · pyplots.ai"
    at the top.'
