review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format following the exact spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, realistic data simulation with weekly patterns and upward trend demonstrating
    area chart utility
  - Proper semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.4) as recommended in spec
  - Good font sizing following the library guidelines (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt
    ticks)
  - Correct output dimensions (4800x2700 via 1600x900 scale=3)
  - HTML output also generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., "Date (January 2024)" instead of
    just "Date")
  - Missing hover template customization which is a key Plotly strength
  - Could benefit from range slider or zoom capabilities to showcase Plotly interactivity
