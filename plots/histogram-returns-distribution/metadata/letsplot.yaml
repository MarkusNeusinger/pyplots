review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: histogram with density normalization,
    normal curve overlay, statistics text box, and tail highlighting'
  - Good use of geom_label for statistics annotation with proper positioning
  - Color scheme effectively distinguishes normal range from tail regions
  - Proper density normalization allows histogram and normal curve to be comparable
  - Fat tail simulation creates realistic financial returns distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines that would improve readability
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like hover tooltips or interactive
    capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily financial returns with
    a density axis (0-0.42). The histogram bars are colored in two distinct colors:
    blue (#306998) for the "Normal Range (±2σ)" and red (#DC2626) for "Tail (beyond
    ±2σ)" regions. The x-axis shows "Daily Returns (%)" ranging from approximately
    -8 to 7. A black dashed line overlays the histogram showing the fitted normal
    distribution curve. Two vertical red dotted lines mark the ±2σ thresholds (approximately
    at -2.8% and +2.9%). A statistics box in the upper-right shows: Mean: 0.038%,
    Std Dev: 1.426%, Skewness: -0.04, Kurtosis: 4.32. A legend in the upper-right
    identifies the two colors. The title reads "histogram-returns-distribution · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai".'
