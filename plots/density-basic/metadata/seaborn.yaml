review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot with fill and rugplot combination for statistical
    visualization
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles with proper structure
  - Bimodal test score data effectively demonstrates distribution characteristics
  - Perfect title format and appropriate axis labels with units
  - Good visual design with subtle grid, appropriate transparency, and readable text
    sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Bimodality in data could be more pronounced - currently appears as a shoulder
    rather than two distinct peaks
  - Grid could use slightly lower alpha (0.2 instead of 0.3) for even more subtle
    appearance
