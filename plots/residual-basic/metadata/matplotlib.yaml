review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including y=0 reference line,
    transparency, and smoothed trend line
  - Symmetric y-axis range around zero provides excellent visual balance for residual
    interpretation
  - Realistic data with heteroscedasticity and outliers demonstrates actual regression
    diagnostic patterns
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper layering via zorder
  - Good use of matplotlib styling with white edge colors on markers for better visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use "Fitted Values (units)" if a specific
    context was established)
  - Legend includes "Zero Reference" which adds visual clutter - the horizontal line
    is self-explanatory
  - Moving average implementation is manual rather than using scipy or statsmodels
    LOWESS for more accurate smoothing
  image_description: 'The plot displays a residual plot with "Fitted Values" on the
    x-axis (ranging from approximately 10 to 90) and "Residuals" on the y-axis (ranging
    from approximately -25 to +25, symmetric around zero). Blue circular markers with
    white edges and moderate transparency (alpha ~0.6) represent individual residual
    points. A horizontal black reference line at y=0 clearly indicates where residuals
    equal zero. A yellow/gold smoothed trend line (moving average) runs through the
    data, hovering near zero and showing slight deviations. The y-axis is symmetric
    around zero as recommended. The legend in the upper right corner shows three items:
    "Zero Reference", "Residuals", and "Trend (Smoothed)". A subtle dashed grid aids
    readability. The title follows the required format: "residual-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai". The data shows realistic heteroscedasticity with variance increasing
    slightly at higher fitted values, and several clear outliers are visible (around
    -22 and +25).'

          could leverage more matplotlib features like axhspan for confidence bands
