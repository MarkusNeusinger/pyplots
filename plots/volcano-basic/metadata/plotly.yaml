review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of volcano plot with all required threshold lines and
    color coding
  - Proper use of Plotly hover templates showing gene name, fold change, and p-value
  - Clean three-color scheme (gray/blue/orange) that is colorblind accessible
  - Appropriate marker sizing and alpha transparency for the data density
  - Gene annotations with arrows for top significant hits
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend includes threshold line entries (p = 0.05, log2FC = 1.0) which adds visual
    clutter; threshold lines are self-explanatory from context
  - Some overlap in the dense central gray point cluster could benefit from slightly
    smaller markers or more transparency
  - Could utilize more Plotly-specific features like updatemenus or rangeslider for
    enhanced interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a volcano plot with approximately 500 data
    points representing simulated gene expression data. The x-axis shows "log₂ Fold
    Change" ranging from approximately -4 to 6, and the y-axis shows "-log₁₀(p-value)"
    ranging from 0 to about 3.5. Points are colored in three categories: gray for
    "Not Significant" (majority of points clustered in the center), blue (#306998)
    for "Down-regulated" genes (left side, above thresholds), and orange (#D35400)
    for "Up-regulated" genes (right side, above thresholds). Dashed threshold lines
    are clearly visible: horizontal line at p = 0.05 (~1.3 on y-axis) and vertical
    lines at log2FC = ±1. Three top significant genes are labeled with arrows (Gene_374,
    Gene_346, Gene_236). The legend is positioned in the upper-left with a semi-transparent
    white background. The overall layout uses the plotly_white template with subtle
    gridlines.'

          data or range sliders
  verdict: APPROVED
