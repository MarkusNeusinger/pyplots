review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological realism with chromosome-specific significant peaks mimicking
    real GWAS patterns (MHC region on chr6)
  - Clean visual design with alternating chromosome colors and clear significance
    thresholds
  - Proper handling of dense data with appropriate marker size and transparency
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Yellow highlighting of significant SNPs provides excellent visual emphasis
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis grid could be styled more subtly (current alpha=0.3 is slightly prominent)
  - Significant SNPs highlighting uses raw matplotlib instead of seaborn; could use
    a second scatterplot call for consistency
  image_description: 'The Manhattan plot displays simulated GWAS data with ~10,000
    SNPs across 22 chromosomes. The x-axis shows chromosome positions with labels
    1-22 centered beneath each chromosome''s region. The y-axis shows -log₁₀(p-value)
    ranging from 0 to ~12. Points are colored with alternating blue (#306998) and
    light blue/gray (#8B9DC3) for adjacent chromosomes. Three distinct significant
    peaks are visible: a major peak on chromosome 6 reaching -log₁₀(p) ≈ 12 (highlighted
    in yellow), a moderate peak on chromosome 11 reaching ≈ 9, and a smaller peak
    on chromosome 2 reaching ≈ 8. Yellow markers with black edges highlight SNPs above
    the genome-wide significance threshold. Two horizontal threshold lines are shown:
    a red dashed line at y=7.3 (genome-wide significance, p < 5×10⁻⁸) and a gray dotted
    line at y=5 (suggestive threshold, p < 1×10⁻⁵). The legend is positioned in the
    upper right. The plot has a clean appearance with only y-axis gridlines and top/right
    spines removed.'

        comment: Good use of seaborn's scatterplot with palette, but falls back to
          matplotlib for significant point highlighting rather than using seaborn
          throughout
  verdict: APPROVED
