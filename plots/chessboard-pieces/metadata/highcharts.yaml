review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts heatmap with annotations for chess piece rendering
  - Proper chess board orientation with h1 as light square
  - Clean traditional chess board color scheme
  - Well-chosen Scholar's Mate position demonstrates visualization effectively
  - Square 3600x3600 format appropriate for chess board
  - Unicode chess symbols render clearly at 72px
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - White outline pieces appear slightly thinner than black filled pieces
  - Minor inconsistency in position comments vs actual Scholar's Mate sequence
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x8 chess board with traditional brown
    (#B58863) and cream (#F0D9B5) alternating square colors. The board shows the Scholar''s
    Mate position - a famous four-move checkmate. White pieces (outline Unicode symbols)
    occupy the bottom of the board with the back rank pieces on row 1, pawns on row
    2, with key moved pieces: bishop on c4, pawn on e4, and the queen on f7 delivering
    checkmate. Black pieces (filled Unicode symbols) are positioned at the top with
    back rank on row 8, pawns on row 7, and knights on c6 and f6. The title "Scholar''s
    Mate · chessboard-pieces · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold
    text. Column labels (a-h) appear at the bottom, row labels (1-8) on the left side.
    The h1 square is correctly light-colored per chess standards. Pieces are centered
    within their squares using 72px font size and are clearly visible.'
