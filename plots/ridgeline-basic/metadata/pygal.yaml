review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ridgeline plot using pygal XY chart with filled polygons
  - Beautiful seasonal color gradient that intuitively conveys temperature patterns
  - Proper KDE computation implemented inline without functions, maintaining KISS
    principle
  - Good overlap between ridges (~60%) creating characteristic mountain-ridge appearance
  - Clean month labels on Y-axis as specified, positioned at ridge baselines
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical grid lines slightly prominent; could use lower alpha for subtler appearance
  - Does not leverage distinctive pygal features like built-in interactivity or tooltips
    in the HTML output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ridgeline visualization of monthly temperature
    distributions. There are 12 semi-transparent, overlapping density curves stacked
    vertically, one for each month (January at top, December at bottom). The curves
    use a seasonal color gradient: cold months (Jan, Feb, Dec) in blue, spring months
    transitioning through cyan/teal and green, summer months (Jun-Aug) in yellow/orange,
    and fall months cycling back through green to blue. The X-axis shows "Temperature
    (°C)" ranging from -10 to 40. Month labels (Jan through Dec) are displayed on
    the Y-axis. The title reads "Monthly Temperature Distribution · ridgeline-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". The layout shows good overlap (~60%) between ridges, creating
    the characteristic mountain-ridge appearance. Background is white with subtle
    vertical grid lines.'

        comment: Uses pygal.XY with fill=True creatively to simulate ridgeline, but
          pygal doesn't have native ridgeline support. This is a clever workaround
          using polygon construction, but doesn't showcase distinctive pygal features
          like built-in chart types or interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
