review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme using seaborn light_palette() to create cohesive
    color families per region
  - Clean visual separation with white edges between segments
  - Well-organized dual legend system clearly distinguishing inner (regions) and outer
    (categories) rings
  - Center text effectively communicates total budget
  - Labels on inner ring include both region names and values for quick reference
  - Realistic business scenario (regional budget allocation) makes the visualization
    immediately understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is primarily used for styling/palettes rather than native plot functions
    (pie charts are matplotlib-native)
  - Inner ring labels at fontsize=13 could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - Category legend only shows blue shades which may cause slight confusion as each
    region has different color shades for the same categories
  image_description: The plot displays a nested donut chart showing regional budget
    allocation. The inner ring shows 4 regions (North America $120M in dark blue,
    Europe $95M in yellow, Asia Pacific $105M in teal, Latin America $50M in gray).
    The outer ring displays expense categories (Salaries, Marketing, Operations, R&D)
    with color gradients from dark to light shades matching each region's parent color.
    The center shows "Total Budget $370M" in bold. Two well-organized legends appear
    on the left side - one for regions (inner) and one for categories (outer). The
    title "donut-nested · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold. The
    plot uses a square 12x12 figure with white background, white edge separations
    between segments, and labels on the inner ring segments showing region names and
    values.
