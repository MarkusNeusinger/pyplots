review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including zero reference line,
    ±2σ threshold bands, and outlier highlighting
  - Clean separation of normal points (blue) and outliers (red) using color differentiation
  - Realistic house price prediction scenario with appropriate heteroscedasticity
    pattern
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with custom styling and stroke patterns for reference
    lines
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is too small to read clearly at the rendered size
  - Axis tick label font size could be larger for better readability on the 4800x2700
    canvas
