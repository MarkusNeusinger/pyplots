review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's layering capability to combine confidence bands with
    stacked areas
  - Clear visualization of increasing uncertainty over time (solar bands widen)
  - Proper title format with informative subtitle
  - Good color palette using Python Blue (#306998) as primary
  - Correct cumulative stacking of both central values and confidence bands
  weaknesses:
  - The two blue shades (Hydro and Wind) could be more visually distinct
  - No grid lines to help read values from the Y-axis
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing renewable energy
    consumption forecast from 2020-Q2 to 2024-Q4. Three energy sources are visualized:
    Hydro (dark blue, bottom layer), Wind (medium blue, middle layer), and Solar (yellow/gold,
    top layer). Each series has a lighter-shaded confidence band around it representing
    the 90% prediction interval. The bands use semi-transparent fills (approximately
    25% opacity) that create a layered appearance where uncertainty regions are visible
    without obscuring the main data. The Y-axis shows "Energy Consumption (TWh)" ranging
    from 0 to 500, and the X-axis shows quarterly time periods formatted as YYYY-QN.
    A legend in the upper right identifies the three energy sources with colored circles.
    The title "area-stacked-confidence · altair · pyplots.ai" is at the top with a
    subtitle "Renewable Energy Consumption Forecast with 90% Confidence Bands". The
    stacking order is consistent: Hydro at the bottom (stable around 120 TWh), Wind
    in the middle (moderate growth), and Solar on top (strongest growth with widening
    uncertainty bands).'
