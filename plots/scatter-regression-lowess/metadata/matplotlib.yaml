review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of LOWESS smoothing on complex non-linear data (sine +
    quadratic + noise)
  - LOWESS curve is visually distinct with contrasting yellow color and thick line
    (linewidth=4)
  - Appropriate smoothing bandwidth (frac=0.3) as recommended in spec
  - Marker transparency (alpha=0.6) shows data density while keeping LOWESS curve
    visible
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - All text elements properly sized for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could be "Measurement Index (samples)" or similar)
  - Data context is generic "Measurement Index" / "Response Value" - could be more
    domain-specific
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 200 blue data points (#306998)
    with white edges and moderate transparency (alpha 0.6). A thick yellow/gold LOWESS
    curve (#FFD43B, linewidth 4) smoothly traces through the data, capturing the non-linear
    pattern. The data shows a relatively flat region from x=0-5, followed by an accelerating
    upward trend from x=5-10. The title "scatter-regression-lowess · matplotlib ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis is labeled "Measurement Index" (0-10),
    Y-axis is labeled "Response Value" (approximately -1 to 17.5). A legend in the
    upper left identifies "Data points" and "LOWESS fit". A subtle dashed grid (alpha
    0.3) aids readability.
