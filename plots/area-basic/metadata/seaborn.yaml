review:
  strengths:
  - Gradient fill using imshow clipped to PathPatch creates a polished vertical gradient
    effect that elevates the visual quality significantly
  - Viral post annotation with curved arrow provides effective data storytelling and
    visual interest
  - Realistic website traffic data with weekly seasonality patterns and an upward
    trend makes the chart immediately comprehensible
  - All font sizes explicitly set to specification requirements (title 24pt, labels
    20pt, ticks 16pt)
  - 'Good use of seaborn-specific features: sns.light_palette(as_cmap=True), sns.set_theme
    with context/rc, sns.despine'
  weaknesses:
  - The gradient fill implementation using imshow+PathPatch is somewhat over-engineered
    for a basic area chart — a simpler approach using ax.fill_between with solid alpha
    and seaborn color utilities could achieve similar effect with cleaner code and
    stronger seaborn idiom alignment
  - Could benefit from one additional annotation or visual cue (e.g., a subtle label
    for the weekend dip pattern or an average line) to push data storytelling to the
    highest tier
  - The y_max multiplier of 1.12 creates slight excess vertical whitespace above the
    spike peak
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart of daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 data points). The line is drawn in Python Blue (#306998)
    with a linewidth of 3, and the area below the curve is filled with a vertical
    gradient that transitions from near-white at the bottom to a soft blue near the
    line (alpha 0.5). A clear weekly cyclical pattern is visible with dips on weekends
    (approximately 3,000-4,000 visitors) and peaks mid-week (5,000-7,000). An upward
    trend is evident across the month. A prominent traffic spike around January 18
    reaches approximately 10,300 visitors and is annotated with "Viral post" in bold
    dark text with a curved arrow pointing to the peak. The title reads "area-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top in large font. X-axis labels show weekly Monday
    dates (Jan 01, Jan 08, Jan 15, Jan 22, Jan 29) rotated 30 degrees. Y-axis shows
    "Visitors (count)" with thousands separators. Top and right spines are removed.
    Subtle horizontal gridlines are present on the y-axis. The layout is well-proportioned
    with the chart filling most of the canvas.
