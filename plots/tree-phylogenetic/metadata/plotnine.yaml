review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering of geom_segment
    for tree branches
  - Well-designed clade color scheme that effectively differentiates evolutionary
    groups
  - Scale bar with proper units (substitutions/site) as required by specification
  - Clean, publication-quality layout using theme_void appropriate for tree diagrams
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny based on real evolutionary relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra text ("Primate Phylogeny") before the spec-id; should
    be just "tree-phylogenetic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
  - Some clade colors (Homininae, Gorillini, Hominini) are identical yellow, making
    it hard to distinguish these clades in the legend
