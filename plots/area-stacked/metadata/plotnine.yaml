review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper geom_area stacking
  - Data ordered by average size (largest at bottom) as recommended in spec
  - Clear, readable text at all sizes with proper font sizing for high-resolution
    output
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with appropriate growth trends
  - Good color palette that is both visually appealing and distinguishable
  - Proper date handling with scale_x_date and formatted quarterly labels
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units like (thousands) for clarity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing website traffic
    sources over 24 months (January 2023 to January 2025). Four colored areas are
    stacked: Social Media (red) at the bottom, Referral (green), Direct (yellow),
    and Organic Search (blue) at the top. The y-axis shows "Monthly Visitors" ranging
    from 0 to approximately 65,000. The x-axis shows "Month" with quarterly date labels.
    The title reads "area-stacked · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold. A legend labeled
    "Traffic Source" appears on the right side. The chart uses a minimal theme with
    subtle gridlines and has good visual balance.'
