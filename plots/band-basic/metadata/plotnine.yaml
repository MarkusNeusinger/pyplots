review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_ribbon + geom_line combination
  - Heteroscedastic uncertainty (band widens over time) is a realistic forecasting
    pattern
  - Clean, minimal theme with well-tuned text sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper 95% CI calculation using 1.96 standard errors
  - Title correctly follows the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (days)" or "Predicted Value (units)")
  - Data could show both narrowing and widening uncertainty regions for better feature
    coverage
  image_description: The plot shows a band plot with a semi-transparent light blue
    (#306998 with alpha 0.3) filled region representing a 95% confidence interval.
    A dark blue central trend line runs through the middle of the band. The x-axis
    shows "Time" ranging from 0.0 to 10.0, and the y-axis shows "Predicted Value"
    ranging from approximately 3 to 12. The title reads "Model Forecast with 95% Confidence
    Interval · band-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The confidence band widens as
    time increases (heteroscedastic uncertainty), which is realistic for forecasting
    scenarios. The background uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines. Text
    is clearly readable at all sizes.
