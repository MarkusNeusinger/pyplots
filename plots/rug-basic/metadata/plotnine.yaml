review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing three distinct clusters plus outliers, perfectly
    demonstrating rug plot capabilities
  - Clean, minimal theme that lets the data speak - appropriate removal of y-axis
    elements
  - Correct title format and proper axis labeling with units
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.7) for overlapping tick marks
  - Realistic response time scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Rug tick marks could be slightly more prominent (larger size) to better utilize
    the high-resolution canvas
  - Large empty space above the rug is inherent to standalone rug plots but creates
    an unbalanced visual
  image_description: 'The plot shows a rug plot displaying response time data as vertical
    tick marks along the bottom x-axis. The title "rug-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in black text. The x-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)"
    and shows values from approximately 100 to 850 ms. Blue tick marks (#306998 color)
    are positioned at the bottom of the plot area, clearly showing three clusters:
    a dense cluster around 100-200ms (fast responses), a moderate cluster around 250-400ms
    (medium responses), and a sparse cluster around 400-550ms (slow responses), plus
    4 isolated outliers between 600-850ms. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle
    vertical grid lines and no y-axis elements, which is appropriate for a pure rug
    plot. The overall layout is clean with good whitespace balance.'

        comment: Good horizontal use but the plot area is mostly empty space above
          the rug (by design for rug plots, but could benefit from slightly taller

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_rug(), theme_minimal(),
          and theme customization. Good use of element_blank() to hide y-axis elements.
          Could have demonstrated additional plotnine features like faceting or combining
          with geom_density().
  verdict: APPROVED
