review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent progressive visualization with opacity gradient and marker size progression
  - Clear start and end point indicators with annotations
  - Full animation implementation with play/pause/reset controls and timeline slider
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Creates both static (PNG) and interactive (HTML) outputs leveraging Plotly strengths
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is quite faint - could be 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - The static PNG could benefit from more visual stages of progression beyond just
    the gradient
  image_description: 'The plot displays a progressive line chart showing monthly sales
    data ($K) from January 2021 to December 2023. The visualization uses a blue color
    scheme (#306998) with a gradient effect - earlier data points appear lighter (low
    opacity) while recent points are darker and more prominent. Markers increase in
    size from ~8px at the start to ~20px at the end, creating a visual progression
    effect. The starting point (Jan 2021 at ~$102K) is marked with a subtle outlined
    circle and "Start" label below. The final point (Dec 2023 at ~$174K) features
    a prominent marker with a yellow/gold border (#FFD43B) and a "Latest" annotation
    with an arrow pointing down to it. The plot shows an overall upward trend with
    seasonal fluctuations (roughly annual cycles). The title "line-animated-progressive
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Axes are clearly labeled: "Date"
    on x-axis with 6-month tick intervals (Jan/Jul format) and "Monthly Sales ($K)"
    on y-axis. The background is white with subtle gray gridlines (alpha ~0.1).'
