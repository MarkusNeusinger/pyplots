review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent radar chart with proper polar/spider chart implementation using Highcharts
    AreaSeries
  - Perfect colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with 25% fill opacity for overlap
    visibility
  - Comprehensive employee performance comparison showing contrasting profiles (technical
    vs soft skills)
  - Well-implemented hexagonal polygon gridlines at 20-point intervals as specified
  - Professional layout with good canvas utilization and well-placed legend
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis labels could include a unit context like Performance Score (0-100)
    though current implementation is acceptable
  image_description: 'The radar chart displays a hexagonal spider/web chart with 6
    axes: Communication (top), Technical Skills (upper-right), Teamwork (lower-right),
    Problem Solving (bottom), Leadership (lower-left), and Creativity (upper-left).
    Two filled polygons represent Employee A (blue #306998) and Employee B (yellow
    #FFD43B), each with ~25% transparency allowing overlap visibility. Employee A
    shows higher values for Technical Skills (~95) and Problem Solving (~90), while
    Employee B excels in Communication (~90) and Teamwork (~95). The chart has polygon-interpolated
    gridlines at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 intervals. The title "radar-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The legend is centered at the bottom
    with circle markers for both employees.'
