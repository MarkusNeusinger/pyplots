review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of scatter matrix using plotnine facet_grid approach
  - 'Clean color scheme using Python branding colors (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B)
    plus complementary coral'
  - Proper use of KDE on diagonal cells with geom_density overlaid on scatter data
  - Good transparency (alpha=0.7) handles point density well for 150 data points
  - Variable strip labels are rotated properly (angle=0 for y-axis) for readability
  - Realistic iris-like data demonstrates all key features of a scatter matrix
  - Title follows exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Uses warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") which could hide legitimate issues
  - Some data transformation loops add complexity (though necessary for facet approach)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter matrix (pairplot) for iris-like
    data with four variables: Petal Length (cm), Petal Width (cm), Sepal Length (cm),
    and Sepal Width (cm). The diagonal cells show kernel density estimates (KDE) for
    each variable. Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots for each variable pair. Data
    is color-coded by Species with three groups: setosa (blue/Python Blue #306998),
    versicolor (yellow/Python Yellow #FFD43B), and virginica (coral/salmon #E07A5F).
    The title "scatter-matrix · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top
    in bold. Variable names are displayed along the top edge (columns) and right edge
    (rows) as strip labels. A legend showing Species with colored markers is positioned
    on the right side. The plot has a clean minimal theme with subtle gridlines and
    good use of transparency (alpha=0.7) for the scatter points.'

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics with ggplot, facet_grid,
          geom_point, geom_density, and theming system. The layered approach is idiomatic.
          Could have explored additional plotnine features.
  verdict: APPROVED
