review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizontal bar chart with proper sorting by importance
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper layering (zero_line, bars, error_bars)
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity showing feature name, mean importance,
    and std dev
  - Sequential blue color gradient effectively emphasizes high-importance features
  - Error bars clearly visible and properly positioned
  - Realistic housing price ML scenario with plausible feature names and importance
    values
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines that would help readers trace values across the chart
  - Could benefit from adding .interactive() for zoom/pan capabilities on the HTML
    version
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart with 15 housing price
    model features sorted by permutation importance (highest at top). Location Score
    (~0.142) and Square Footage (~0.128) are the most important features, shown with
    darker blue bars. The color gradient uses a sequential blue palette ("blues" scheme),
    with bars transitioning from dark blue (high importance) to very light blue (near-zero
    or negative importance). Horizontal error bars extend from each bar showing variability
    across shuffles. A vertical dashed reference line at x=0 distinguishes positive
    from negative importance. Two features (Basement Area and Pool Presence) show
    small negative importance values. The x-axis is labeled "Mean Decrease in Model
    Score" and y-axis is labeled "Feature". The title correctly uses the format "bar-permutation-importance
    · altair · pyplots.ai".
