review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using ggbunch to compose the 4x4 matrix layout
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity on scatter points
  - Realistic iris-like synthetic data with meaningful correlations between species
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar
  - Alpha blending helps with point overlap visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing linked brushing/selection which is the core feature of an interactive
    SPLOM - lets-plot has limited support for this
  - No axis labels showing variable names on the matrix edges (critical for SPLOM
    interpretation)
  - Yellow color has poor contrast on white background; consider a darker alternative
  - Legend in static export shows only dots without clear species labels association
  image_description: The plot displays a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) for iris-like
    data with three species (Setosa in blue, Versicolor in yellow, Virginica in red).
    The diagonal cells show stacked histograms displaying the distribution of each
    variable (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) broken down by
    species. Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots comparing pairs of variables with
    points colored by species. The title "scatter-matrix-interactive · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend at the bottom shows the three species
    with their colors. The color palette uses blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), and
    red (#DC2626). Each subplot has axis ticks but no axis labels within the grid.
    Points have alpha transparency for overlap handling.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, ggbunch for composition, tooltips for hover.
          However, lets-plot does not natively support linked brushing across subplots.
