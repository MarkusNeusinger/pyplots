review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with proper nesting and containment
  - Smart use of square figure format (12x12) appropriate for circular visualization
  - 'Colorblind-safe palette with good visual hierarchy (root: muted blue, departments:
    bright yellow, teams: light blue)'
  - Proper area-based sizing using sqrt scaling for accurate visual perception
  - Clean implementation of painter's algorithm (drawing larger circles first)
  - Realistic organizational data that makes the visualization immediately understandable
  - Well-positioned legend that doesn't interfere with the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Team-level circles lack labels (only circles with radius > 30 get labels), making
    it hard to identify specific teams
  - Could benefit from showing team names at least for the larger team circles (e.g.,
    Backend at 35 employees)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a circle packing chart with a company organizational
    hierarchy. There is one large light blue root circle labeled "Company" in the
    center. Inside this root circle are four yellow department circles arranged in
    quadrants: "Engineering" (upper left), "Product" (upper right), "Sales" (lower
    left), and "Operations" (lower right). Each department circle contains 3-4 smaller
    light blue team circles representing individual teams. The title "circlepacking-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. A legend in
    the upper right shows "Company (Root)" in blue, "Departments" in yellow, and "Teams"
    in light blue. The circles are all properly nested without overlapping, and sizing
    appears proportional to values.'
