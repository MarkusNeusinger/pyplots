review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean sorted descending layout makes frequency comparison intuitive
  - Realistic electronics product category scenario with weighted probability distribution
  - Value labels on top of each bar enhance readability without cluttering
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive pygal features (e.g., custom tooltips with percentage,
    value_formatter showing both count and percentage)
  - Color variety could be added to distinguish high vs low frequency categories
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product category
    frequencies. Six blue bars (#306998) represent different electronics categories:
    Smartphone (142), Laptop (130), Tablet (74), Smartwatch (62), Desktop (48), and
    Headphones (44). The bars are sorted in descending order by count. Each bar has
    its count value displayed on top. The title "bar-categorical · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" and y-axis is labeled
    "Count (Frequency)". Horizontal grid lines (dotted, subtle) help read values.
    White background with clean layout.'
