quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of categorical counting with pandas value_counts()
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color choice
  - Data labels on bars enhance readability
  - Proper sorting by descending count as noted in spec
  - Good use of subtitle to provide context
  - Interactive HTML version also generated for web viewing
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title is partially cut off at the bottom of the image despite marginBottom/spacingBottom
    settings
  - Image height is 2561px instead of the specified 2700px (browser viewport issue)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical column/bar chart with a white background.
    The title "bar-categorical · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold
    black text, with a subtitle "Product Category Purchase Frequency" below it. Six
    blue (#306998) bars represent different product categories: Electronics (130),
    Clothing (93), Books (86), Home & Garden (78), Sports (58), and Toys (55). Each
    bar has a data label showing its count value. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category"
    and shows all category names clearly. The y-axis is labeled "Count" and ranges
    from 0 to 140 with gridlines. The bars are sorted in descending order by count.
    The bars have slightly rounded corners (borderRadius: 4).'

        comment: Title at 48px, axis titles at 36px, labels at 32px - all highly readable.
          Slight deduction as tick labels could be slightly larger.
