review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data choice: real-world technology radar inspired by ThoughtWorks,
    with plausible adoption stage assignments for 28 technologies across 4 domains'
  - Effective use of Highcharts chart.renderer API for custom SVG overlays (concentric
    circles, sector dividers, ring labels, sector headers)
  - Good color palette with 4 distinguishable, colorblind-safe sector colors and subtle
    ring background fills
  - Clean interactive HTML version (plot.html) alongside the static PNG export
  - Correct title format and well-structured legend with category colors
  weaknesses:
  - Label overlap in the Adopt ring is the most significant issue — 7+ items cluster
    near the center with overlapping text labels that reduce readability
  - The spec suggests using 180 or 270 degree layout to leave room for legend and
    reduce label crowding, but the implementation uses full 360 degrees which contributes
    to the overlap problem
  - Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold) are placed only along the top axis with
    low opacity (0.55) — they could be more prominent or placed at multiple angles
    for better readability
  - Data labels at 20px with y-offset of -20 are not sufficient for the crowded inner
    rings — needs smarter label placement with varying offsets or angular jittering
  image_description: 'The plot displays a technology innovation radar chart on a light
    gray (#fafafa) background. Four concentric dashed circles represent adoption stages:
    Adopt (innermost), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost), with subtle blue-tinted
    fills that decrease in opacity outward. Four sectors divide the circular space
    with thin radial lines: AI & ML (blue), Cloud & DevOps (orange), Security (green),
    and Data Engineering (purple). 28 technology items are plotted as colored circle
    markers with white borders, each labeled with its technology name in gray text
    with white outlines. Sector headers appear in bold colored text near the outer
    edge. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold) appear in italic colored text near
    the center-top axis. A vertical legend on the right side with a white rounded-corner
    box lists the four sector colors. The title "radar-innovation-timeline · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold text, with a subtitle below. Notable
    label crowding occurs in the inner Adopt ring where multiple items overlap.'
