review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of asymmetric error bars with visible caps and appropriate
    thickness
  - Excellent use of fill_between to show confidence region - enhances visual understanding
  - Well-chosen realistic business scenario with monthly sales data
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good color choice and overall visual balance
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size (15) could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Legend could better explain what asymmetric bounds represent (the fill region
    is not explained)
  image_description: The plot displays a clean asymmetric error bar visualization
    with 8 data points representing monthly sales data (Jan-Aug). Each point is shown
    as a solid blue (#306998) circle marker with thick vertical error bars extending
    asymmetrically above and below. The error bars have visible horizontal caps at
    both ends. A subtle light blue filled region connects all error bounds, showing
    the confidence interval range across months. The title "errorbar-asymmetric ·
    matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. The x-axis shows
    months, y-axis shows "Sales (thousands USD)" ranging from 0 to 120. A legend in
    the upper left explains "Median with 10th-90th percentile". The grid is subtle
    with dashed lines and low opacity.

        comment: Uses standard errorbar function correctly but fill_between is a nice
          touch; could leverage more matplotlib-specific features like custom error
          bar styling or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
