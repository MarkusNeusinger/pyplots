review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes and white background boxes
    for counts
  - Set2 palette provides strong colorblind accessibility
  - Clean equilateral triangle arrangement with proper spacing
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Accurate calculation of all region counts (exclusive, pairwise, triple)
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.4) for visualizing overlaps
  - Informative subtitle providing data context
  weaknesses:
  - 'Data inconsistency: subtitle states 150 respondents but set totals sum to 240
    (should fix subtitle to reflect actual respondent count or adjust set sizes)'
  - Redundant legend that duplicates inline labels without adding value
  - Corner whitespace could be reduced for better canvas utilization
