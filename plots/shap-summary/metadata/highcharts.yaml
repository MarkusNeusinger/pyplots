review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of SHAP summary plot using scatter series with color-coded
    bins
  - Well-chosen realistic context (house price prediction) with meaningful feature
    names
  - Proper sorting of features by mean absolute SHAP value (most important at top)
  - Clear visual separation using vertical line at x=0
  - Good use of jittering to reduce point overlap
  - Correct title format and professional subtitle
  - Properly saves both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Blue-red color scheme, while conventional for SHAP, is not optimal for colorblind
    accessibility (consider viridis or plasma alternatives in future)
  - All features show similar linear correlation patterns - more diverse SHAP distributions
    (e.g., some features with non-linear effects, clustered values) would better demonstrate
    the plot type capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a SHAP summary visualization with 10 features
    (House Size, Bedrooms, Location Score, Bathrooms, Age, Garage Spaces, Lot Size,
    School Rating, Crime Rate, Distance to City) ordered vertically by importance.
    Each feature row contains scattered dots representing individual samples, positioned
    horizontally by their SHAP values. A blue-to-red color gradient indicates feature
    values (low=blue, high=red), with a diverging color scale clearly visible. A vertical
    black line at x=0 separates positive and negative SHAP impacts. The title reads
    "shap-summary · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Feature Importance and
    Impact on Model Predictions". The legend on the right shows "Feature Value" with
    three representative bins (0.0-0.1, 0.4-0.5, 0.9-1.0). The x-axis shows SHAP values
    ranging approximately from -1 to 10. Points are appropriately jittered vertically
    to reduce overlap.
