quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves using lets-plot ggplot2
    grammar of graphics
  - Proper use of geom_step for survival curves (not smooth lines) as required for
    KM plots
  - 95% confidence intervals correctly implemented using Greenwood formula and displayed
    as ribbons
  - Censored observations clearly marked with plus symbols along the curves
  - Good color differentiation between Treatment and Control groups
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with appropriate sample sizes and hazard rates
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated as expected for interactive library
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of flat KISS structure required by code standards
  - Legend shows colored boxes instead of step-line representations
  - Missing optional median survival time annotation mentioned in spec notes
