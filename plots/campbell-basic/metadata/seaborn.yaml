review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with operating range shading and differentiated critical
    speed markers (in-range vs outside)
  - 'Complete spec compliance with all required features: 5 modes, 3 engine orders,
    critical speed markers, proper labels'
  - Publication-quality design with custom palette, despined axes, subtle grid, and
    direct mode labels
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper critical speed interpolation using sign-change
    detection
  - Realistic rotordynamics data with varied mode behaviors (increasing, decreasing,
    sinusoidal frequency dependence)
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on raw matplotlib for engine orders, critical speed markers, and
    custom legend — seaborn distinctive features are underutilized
  - Right-side direct labels for 1st Torsional and Axial modes are close together,
    risking visual crowding at some resolutions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram plotting Frequency (Hz)
    on the Y-axis against Rotational Speed (RPM) on the X-axis. Five natural frequency
    mode curves are shown: 1st Bending (blue), 2nd Bending (orange), 1st Torsional
    (green), Axial (purple), and 3rd Bending (cyan). Three dashed grey engine order
    lines (1x, 2x, 3x) radiate from the origin with increasing slope. Critical speed
    intersection markers appear as red circles — larger dark-red markers for intersections
    within the shaded operating range (2800–4200 RPM) and smaller pinkish markers
    outside it. The operating range is highlighted with a light peach/orange vertical
    band and labeled "Operating Range" at the bottom. Direct mode labels in matching
    colors appear on the right side of each curve. A comprehensive legend at the top
    center uses 3 columns to identify all elements. The title reads "campbell-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in medium-weight font.'
