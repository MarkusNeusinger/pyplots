review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data design: four distinct distribution shapes (normal, tight, wide,
    bimodal) showcase the full power of violin plots'
  - Path effects on quantile lines ensure legibility against colored bodies — a thoughtful
    detail
  - Coordinated annotation with matching color and arrow guides the viewer to the
    bimodal insight
  - Custom palette with edge color hierarchy adds depth and professional polish
  - Yellow median line is immediately distinguishable from white quartile lines
  weaknesses:
  - Blue-green color pair may be slightly ambiguous for deuteranopia
  - Default matplotlib font family used throughout — a custom sans-serif font could
    elevate the aesthetic further
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes representing test score
    distributions across four schools: Lincoln HS (steel blue, #306998), Roosevelt
    Acad. (muted green, #5BA58B), Jefferson HS (soft purple, #7A6FB5), and Hamilton
    Prep (warm orange, #D4853F). Each violin has darker edge colors matching its fill.
    Inside each violin, white horizontal lines mark Q1 and Q3, while a brighter yellow
    line marks the median. Path effects (dark stroke behind lines) make quartile markers
    legible against the colored bodies. Lincoln HS shows a broad normal distribution
    centered ~75; Roosevelt Acad. shows a tight cluster around ~85; Jefferson HS has
    the widest spread centered ~63 reaching down to ~30; Hamilton Prep shows a distinctive
    bimodal shape with two bulges (~70 and ~88). An italic annotation in brown reads
    "Two distinct performance groups" with an arrow pointing into Hamilton''s violin.
    Top and right spines are removed, a subtle y-axis grid (alpha=0.2) is visible,
    and the title reads "violin-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format.
    Axis labels are "School" (x) and "Test Score (points)" (y).'
