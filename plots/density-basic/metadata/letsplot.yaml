quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper layering
  - Excellent bimodal data generation showing both main distribution and high achievers
  - Proper use of theme customization for text sizing and grid styling
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scaling for 4800x2700 output
  - Good color choice with appropriate alpha for fill transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Test Score (points)" or "Density (probability)")
  - Test score values exceeding 100 are unrealistic for typical grading scales
  - Could benefit from a rug plot to show individual observations as suggested in
