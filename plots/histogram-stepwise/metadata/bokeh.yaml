review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram using manual coordinate calculation
    for the step function appearance
  - Clean comparison of two distributions without visual overlap issues (outline-only
    approach)
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue and yellow)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears small relative to other text elements despite having label_text_font_size
    set
  - Could demonstrate more variety in the distributions (different spreads or shapes)
  image_description: The plot shows two step histograms (outline only, no fill) comparing
    temperature distributions from two sensors. The blue line represents "Sensor A"
    with a distribution centered around 50°C, and the yellow/gold line represents
    "Sensor B" centered around 65°C. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from
    approximately 15 to 100, and the y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to about 56.
    The title reads "histogram-stepwise · bokeh · pyplots.ai" in the top-left. A legend
    in the top-right corner identifies the two sensors. The background is white with
    subtle dashed grid lines. Both distributions show the characteristic step function
    appearance with horizontal segments at count levels connected by vertical segments.

        comment: Shows two overlapping distributions for comparison as suggested in
          spec, demonstrates the advantage of step histograms for comparing distributions;
          minor deduction as distributions could show more variety (e.g., different
          spreads)

        comment: Uses basic Bokeh line plotting and export features; could leverage
          more Bokeh-specific features like hover tools or better interactivity in
          the HTML output
