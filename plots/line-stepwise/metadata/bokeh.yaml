review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step line implementation with manual coordinate transformation for post
    step style
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic CPU usage scenario that naturally demonstrates stepwise behavior
  - Good visual clarity with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use Bokeh native step line mode (line with step_mode parameter) which
    would be more idiomatic
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance the interactive HTML version
  - Markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at the target resolution
  - Small random noise in data slightly contradicts the discrete state changes concept
    from the spec
