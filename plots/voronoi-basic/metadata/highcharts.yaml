review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of Voronoi partitioning with clearly visible cells
    and seed points
  - Proper clipping to bounding box using Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm
  - Good use of Highcharts polygon and scatter series for layered visualization
  - Colorblind-conscious palette with diverse colors
  - Clean title format matching specification requirements
  - Interactive HTML export alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function violates KISS principle (though arguably necessary for polygon
    clipping complexity)
  - Some adjacent cells have similar colors which slightly reduces visual distinction
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (lower alpha)
  image_description: The plot displays a Voronoi diagram with 20 seed points partitioning
    a 100×100 coordinate space. Each Voronoi cell is filled with a distinct semi-transparent
    color (including blue, yellow, purple, cyan, brown, orange, red, pink, green,
    gray, and others) with dark gray borders separating adjacent cells. The seed points
    are rendered as black circles with white borders, clearly visible within their
    respective cells. The title "voronoi-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Spatial partitioning based on proximity to
    seed points" below it. The X-axis is labeled "X Coordinate" (0-100) and the Y-axis
    is labeled "Y Coordinate" (0-100), both with grid lines at intervals of 10. The
    entire bounding box is filled with Voronoi cells clipped to the visible region.
