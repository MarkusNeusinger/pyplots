review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent adherence to spec requirements: semi-transparent fill, gridlines, clear
    labels'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Perfect title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  - Realistic website visitor data with natural trend and variation
  - Good use of fill_between with matching line plot on top
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels missing units (e.g., Daily Visitors could include count)
  - Did not implement optional gradient fill from bottom to line for visual appeal
  - Basic matplotlib usage without leveraging distinctive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart with a blue filled area
    (#306998 color) showing daily website visitors over a 30-day period. The x-axis
    is labeled "Day of Month" ranging from 1 to 30, and the y-axis shows "Daily Visitors"
    ranging from 0 to approximately 8000. The title follows the correct format: "area-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The area is filled with semi-transparent blue (alpha
    ~0.4) with a solid blue line on top (linewidth 3). A subtle dashed grid (alpha
    0.3) helps with value estimation. The data shows an upward trend with natural
    variation - starting around 5000 visitors and trending upward to around 6500-7000
    by day 30, with visible day-to-day fluctuations adding realism.'

        comment: Uses fill_between correctly but no gradient fill (mentioned in spec
          notes as optional enhancement), no use of matplotlib-specific features like
          color gradients or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
