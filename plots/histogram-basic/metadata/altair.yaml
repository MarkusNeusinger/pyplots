review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code with proper declarative grammar
  - Good data choice — bimodal height distribution shows histogram strengths
  - 'Thoughtful visual refinements: subtle dashed gridlines, bar stroke edges, removed
    view border'
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features present
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the bimodal distribution (primary group at 170 cm + taller
    subgroup at 185 cm) is never annotated or highlighted — this is the most interesting
    feature of the data and should be called out'
  - The plot could benefit from annotations marking the two distribution peaks or
    a vertical rule/text label explaining the subgroups
  - Could push aesthetic sophistication further with mean/median lines, better color
    gradients, or more distinctive styling
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of human height measurements in
    centimeters. Bars are rendered in a dark blue (#306998) with thin darker stroke
    edges (#1e4a6e). The x-axis is labeled "Height (cm)" spanning from approximately
    144 to 200, and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency" ranging from 0 to about 45.
    The title reads "histogram-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The
    distribution is roughly bell-shaped with a primary mode around 170 cm and a visible
    secondary bump around 184–186 cm, reflecting the bimodal data generation (400
    samples at μ=170 + 100 at μ=185). Subtle dashed horizontal gridlines appear on
    the y-axis with low opacity. The chart border is removed. The overall layout is
    clean with good canvas utilization.
