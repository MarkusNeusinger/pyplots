review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation using pygal XML filter to draw custom packed
    bubbles since pygal lacks native packed bubble chart
  - Clean packing algorithm that places circles without overlap and keeps them centered
  - Good color palette with four distinct group colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Proper area-based scaling using sqrt for accurate visual perception
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  - Correct title format and legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Value labels show only dollar amounts without category names - larger circles
    could fit abbreviated labels
  - Some smaller circles have cramped or small value labels
