review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-proportioned rectangles and clear frequency
    labels
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Classic Titanic dataset provides an intuitive real-world example of categorical
    association
  - Good use of matplotlib patches for custom mosaic construction
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with good contrast
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Spec recommends using statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot but implementation uses
    manual patches approach
  - Legend placement in upper-right could be better integrated
  - Shade variations within survival categories (3 blues, 3 yellows) may cause confusion
    about what they represent
  image_description: 'The mosaic plot displays Titanic passenger survival data across
    three classes (First, Second, Third). The visualization uses a rectangular area
    divided into columns by passenger class, where column widths are proportional
    to total passengers in each class. Within each column, two stacked rectangles
    show "Survived" (blue shades: #306998, #4A90C2, #6EB5E0) and "Did Not Survive"
    (yellow/gold shades: #FFD43B, #E8C547, #D4A84A). Rectangle heights represent conditional
    survival proportions within each class. Frequency counts are clearly displayed
    in white bold text inside each cell: First class (136 survived, 64 died), Second
    class (87 survived, 93 died), Third class (119 survived, 381 died). The title
    follows the required format "Titanic Passenger Survival by Class · mosaic-categorical
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper right identifies the color coding
    for "Survived" and "Did Not Survive". Axis labels clearly indicate "Passenger
    Class" (x-axis) and "Survival Status" (y-axis). The plot effectively shows the
    stark survival rate differences: First class ~68%, Second ~48%, Third ~24%. The
    overall layout is clean with rounded rectangle corners and white edge highlighting.'
