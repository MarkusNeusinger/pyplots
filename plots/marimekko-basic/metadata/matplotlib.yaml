review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Marimekko concept with proportional bar widths
    and stacked segments
  - Clear value labels on larger segments with smart color contrast (white on dark
    blue, black on light colors)
  - Professional appearance with Python signature colors and colorblind-safe palette
  - Region totals displayed below each bar provide useful context
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside plot creates empty space in upper right corner; could
    be positioned inside the plot area
  - The y-axis label is clear but the plot would benefit from a subtitle explaining
    the width interpretation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Marimekko chart with 4 variable-width bars
    representing global regions (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America).
    Bar widths are proportional to each region''s total market size—Asia Pacific is
    widest ($500M) while Latin America is narrowest ($120M). Each bar is vertically
    divided into 4 stacked segments representing product lines: Electronics (Python
    blue #306998), Apparel (Python yellow #FFD43B), Home & Garden (green #4DAF4A),
    and Sports (purple #984EA3). The y-axis shows percentage share (0%-100%) labeled
    "Share within Region". Value labels (e.g., "$120M", "$200M") appear on larger
    segments with white text on blue backgrounds and black text on lighter colors.
    Region names with total market sizes appear below each bar. A legend titled "Product
    Lines" sits outside the plot to the upper right. The title correctly follows the
    format: "marimekko-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Good use of ax.bar with bottom parameter for stacking, ax.text for

          transforms
  verdict: APPROVED
