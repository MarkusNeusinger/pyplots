review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spectrogram visualization with clear chirp signal and tone burst demonstration
  - Perfect use of viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe
  - Proper dB scale on colorbar with appropriate floor value (-80 dB)
  - Good NFFT (256) and overlap (200) parameters for reasonable time-frequency resolution
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle
  - Signal combination (chirp + burst + noise) effectively demonstrates time-varying
    frequency content
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more matplotlib-specific features such as adding a time-domain
    plot of the signal above the spectrogram
  - The burst signal at 500 Hz overlaps visually with the chirp in a way that could
    be clearer with different timing
  image_description: The plot displays a spectrogram showing time-frequency representation
    of a signal. The x-axis shows "Time (s)" ranging from 0 to approximately 2 seconds,
    and the y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" ranging from 0 to 2000 Hz. The plot uses
    the viridis colormap (purple-blue-green-yellow gradient) where brighter yellow
    indicates higher power/frequency values. A clear diagonal line (chirp signal)
    sweeps from approximately 100 Hz at t=0 to 1000 Hz at t=2s. There's also a visible
    horizontal burst around 500 Hz between t=0.8s and t=1.2s overlapping with the
    chirp. The background shows noise at roughly -60 to -70 dB/Hz (blue-purple tones).
    A colorbar on the right indicates "Power/Frequency (dB/Hz)" ranging from -80 to
    approximately -20 dB/Hz. The title correctly shows "spectrogram-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai".

        comment: Uses matplotlib's built-in ax.specgram() which is good, but doesn't
          leverage additional matplotlib features like adding annotations, custom
          colorbar formatting, or secondary plots (e.g., time domain signal above
          spectrogram)
  verdict: APPROVED
