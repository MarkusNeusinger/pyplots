review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent small multiples approach to show animation frames as static grid
  - Consistent color assignment per company allows visual tracking across years
  - Realistic tech market cap data with compelling narrative (NVIDIA rise)
  - Values displayed on bars improve readability
  - Proper use of pygal HorizontalBar with custom styling
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels (company names) not visible in subplots - should appear beside each
    bar
  - X-axis tick labels are truncated and overlap in several panels
  - Heavy reliance on PIL/cairosvg for final composition rather than native pygal
    output
  - No legend in static output makes color-company mapping unclear without y-axis
    labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x2 grid (small multiples layout) showing
    tech company market cap evolution from 2019-2024. Each panel represents one year
    with horizontal bars sorted by value. Eight companies are shown: Apple (blue),
    Microsoft (yellow), Alphabet (blue), Amazon (orange), Meta (blue), Tesla (red),
    NVIDIA (green), and Samsung (dark blue). Bar values are displayed in the middle
    of each bar in "$XB" format. The main title at top reads "bar-race-animated ·
    pygal · pyplots.ai" in black. Each subplot has the year as title and "Market Cap
    (Billion USD)" as x-axis label. The ranking changes are visible across years -
    notably NVIDIA rises dramatically from 8th place in 2019 to 1st place by 2024.
    Colors remain consistent for each company across all frames, allowing visual tracking.'
