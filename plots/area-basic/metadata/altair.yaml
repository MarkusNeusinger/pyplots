review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent weekly pattern simulation showing realistic website traffic with weekday
    peaks and weekend dips
  - Clean declarative Altair code following the library's grammar of graphics philosophy
  - Good use of opacity (0.4) and line styling to create visual depth
  - Proper use of temporal encoding (:T) for dates
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units (e.g., Daily Visitors (count))
  - Could add tooltip showing exact values for interactive version carried to static
    aesthetics
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 days). The area is filled with a semi-transparent blue color
    (#306998) with a darker blue line along the top edge. The title "area-basic ·
    altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in black text. The X-axis shows "Date"
    with date labels (2024, Wed 03, Fri 05, etc.), and the Y-axis shows "Daily Visitors"
    ranging from 0 to approximately 8,500. Dashed gridlines are visible throughout.
    The data shows a clear weekly pattern with dips on weekends (Saturday/Sunday)
    and higher values on weekdays, plus an overall upward trend from ~6,000 to ~7,500
    visitors.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative grammar with `.encode()`, `.properties()`,
          `.configure_axis()`, and `.interactive()` for HTML output. Could leverage
          more Altair-specific features like tooltips in the static version.
  verdict: APPROVED
