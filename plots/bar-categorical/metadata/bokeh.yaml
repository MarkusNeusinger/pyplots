review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean implementation of categorical counting from raw data as spec requires
  - Good sorting by count descending for clear visualization
  - Professional color scheme with subtle border styling
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool to display exact counts on hover (Bokeh's key interactive feature)
  - Could benefit from value labels on top of bars for static PNG output
