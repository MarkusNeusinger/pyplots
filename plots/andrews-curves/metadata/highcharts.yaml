review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clear cluster separation visible - Setosa distinctly separated from Versicolor/Virginica
  - Proper use of transparency (0.5 opacity) to show overlapping curve density
  - Well-implemented Andrews curve transformation following Fourier series formula
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  - Normalized data using StandardScaler as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function andrews_curve() deviates from pure KISS structure (minor)
  - Y-axis label f(t) could be more descriptive for general audience
  image_description: The plot displays Andrews curves for the Iris dataset with three
    species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) shown in different colors. The x-axis
    represents t (radians) ranging from -3 to 3, and the y-axis represents f(t) ranging
    from approximately -5 to 6. Blue curves represent Setosa, yellow/gold curves represent
    Versicolor, and purple curves represent Virginica. The curves show distinctive
    wave patterns that help distinguish species - Setosa curves (blue) tend to have
    lower amplitude and cluster together, while Versicolor (yellow) and Virginica
    (purple) show more overlap but with distinguishable patterns. A vertical legend
    is positioned in the upper right corner with a white background. The title reads
    "Iris Species · andrews-curves · highcharts · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle
    and visible. Transparency is applied to the curves allowing overlapping patterns
    to be visible.
  verdict: APPROVED
