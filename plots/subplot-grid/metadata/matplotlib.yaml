review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent financial dashboard example perfectly demonstrating the subplot-grid
    concept with four distinct but related visualizations
  - 'Creative color encoding: volume bars colored by return sign, scatter colored
    by return value'
  - Moving average overlay adds depth to the price chart
  - Statistical annotations (mean, zero line) in histogram enhance educational value
  - Clean, professional appearance with consistent styling across all subplots
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes slightly below recommended guidelines (titles 18pt vs 24pt, labels
    16pt vs 20pt)
  - Legend fontsize could be larger for better readability (12-14 vs 16)
  image_description: "The plot displays a 2x2 grid of financial dashboard-style visualizations\
    \ with a main title \"subplot-grid · matplotlib · pyplots.ai\" at the top. \n\
    - **Top-left**: Line chart showing stock price over 100 trading days (blue solid\
    \ line) with a 20-day moving average (yellow dashed line). Price ranges from ~80\
    \ to ~110 dollars.\n- **Top-right**: Bar chart showing trading volume in thousands,\
    \ with blue bars for positive return days and red/coral bars for negative return\
    \ days.\n- **Bottom-left**: Histogram showing return distribution from -6% to\
    \ +4%, with a yellow vertical line at zero and a red dashed line at mean (-0.16%).\
    \ The distribution appears roughly normal.\n- **Bottom-right**: Scatter plot showing\
    \ Volume vs Absolute Return magnitude, with points colored by return value using\
    \ an RdYlGn colormap (red=negative, green=positive), plus a colorbar.\nColors\
    \ used: Python blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), red (#D94A4A), RdYlGn colormap.\
    \ All text is clearly readable with appropriate sizing."

        comment: Good use of plt.subplots, colorbar, axes methods - but could showcase
          more advanced features like gridspec, shared axes, or inset_axes
  verdict: APPROVED
