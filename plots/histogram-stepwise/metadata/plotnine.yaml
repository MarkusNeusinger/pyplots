review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram using geom_step with manually computed
    bin edges
  - Perfect demonstration of overlaying multiple distributions for comparison (key
    application from spec)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper figure sizing (16x9) and text scaling for 4800x2700 output
  - Good color contrast between the two distributions
  - Realistic and neutral data scenario (server performance comparison)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement inside the plot area could potentially overlap with data in some
    cases; consider placing outside
  - Manual histogram computation instead of exploring plotnine native histogram capabilities
