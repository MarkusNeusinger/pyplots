review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of interactive features: zoom, pan, reset button, and
    HTML-formatted tooltips'
  - Clean color scheme with good visual hierarchy and white cell borders
  - Realistic and engaging data scenario (website analytics)
  - Proper title format and comprehensive axis labeling
  - Smooth hover effects with brightness adjustment and border highlighting
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw JavaScript/HTML approach instead of highcharts-core Python library
  - Colorbar legend is positioned quite far from the main heatmap
  - Some rows have similar color patterns reducing visual diversity
  image_description: The plot displays a heatmap showing website page views by category
    (20 categories on Y-axis) and month (12 months on X-axis). The title "heatmap-interactive
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle explaining the data
    and interaction instructions ("Website Page Views by Category and Month (thousands)
    — Click and drag to zoom, Shift+drag to pan"). The color scheme uses a gradient
    from light cream/white (low values around 0-20) through yellow and orange (mid-range
    values 40-80) to dark blue (high values 100-160). Each cell represents page views
    in thousands, with clear white borders between cells providing visual separation.
    The Y-axis shows 20 page categories (Homepage, Products, Services, About Us, Contact,
    Blog, FAQ, Support, Pricing, Careers, News, Events, Resources, Docs, Tutorials,
    API, Downloads, Partners, Investors, Legal) and the X-axis shows all 12 months
    (Jan through Dec). A vertical color legend on the right side labeled "Views (K)"
    shows the scale from 0 to 160. The layout is well-balanced with appropriate margins
    on all sides. All text is clearly legible with good font sizing for the 4800x2700
    resolution.
