review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn PairGrid for creating the scatter matrix
  - Clear documentation noting seaborn static limitation for interactive features
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between species
  - Appropriate use of KDE on diagonal to show univariate distributions
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Subtitle text is small and positioned too close to the title, reducing visual
    clarity
  - Scatter marker size (s=150) may be slightly large for 150 data points, causing
    some overlap
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (alpha=0.2 would be better than 0.3)
  - Cannot implement core interactive features (brushing, linked selection) per spec
    requirements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) using the
    Iris dataset with four variables: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and
    Petal Width (all in cm). The diagonal cells contain KDE (kernel density estimation)
    plots showing the univariate distribution of each variable, with semi-transparent
    fills in blue (#306998 for setosa), yellow (#FFD43B for versicolor), and green
    (#4DAF4A for virginica). Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots of pairwise relationships
    between variables, with circular markers featuring white edge highlighting. A
    legend on the right side displays the three species categories. The title "scatter-matrix-interactive
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle noting that
    interactive features require other libraries. Gridlines are visible with dashed
    styling at reduced opacity. The layout is square format with good proportions.'
