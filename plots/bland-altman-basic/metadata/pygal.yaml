review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic blood pressure measurement scenario matching the spec
    example
  - Clean implementation with proper Bland-Altman calculations (mean, SD, LoA at ±1.96
    SD)
  - Legend effectively displays calculated values for mean bias and limits of agreement
  - Good color scheme with distinct colors for measurements, mean line, and LoA boundaries
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle/invisible - should have alpha around 0.2-0.4 for visibility
  - LoA values should be annotated directly on the plot as spec states - currently
    only shown in legend
  - Tick label font size could be larger for better readability on 4800x2700 canvas
