review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world economics example (advertising diminishing returns) that
    naturally demonstrates polynomial regression
  - R² value (0.936) and polynomial equation prominently displayed as spec requires
  - Confidence band adds statistical context beyond minimum requirements
  - Strong color contrast between blue points (#306998) and yellow curve (#FFD43B)
  - 'Proper lets-plot idioms: ggplot grammar, ggsize(1600,900) with scale=3, theme
    customization'
  weaknesses:
  - The geom_ribbon confidence band renders with dark border lines at the edges, which
    appears as two additional gray curves surrounding the yellow polynomial line -
    this is visually distracting
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with polynomial regression showing
    the relationship between advertising spend (x-axis, in thousands $) and sales
    revenue (y-axis, in thousands $). Blue scatter points (#306998) are distributed
    following a curved pattern showing diminishing returns. A bright yellow polynomial
    regression curve fits through the data. A light blue confidence band surrounds
    the curve. The R² value (0.936) is prominently displayed in the upper right, along
    with the polynomial equation (y = -0.046x² + 3.789x + 21.45). The title "scatter-regression-polynomial
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with
    subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: The confidence band border (dark gray line at edges of ribbon) is
          visually distracting; appears as additional curves rather than subtle shading
          boundary. No legend needed for this plot type
