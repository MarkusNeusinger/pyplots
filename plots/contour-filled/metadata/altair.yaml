review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent discrete color banding implementation using 12 levels with proper binning
    to achieve filled contour appearance
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized data generation
  - Good use of viridis colormap which is colorblind-accessible
  - Creative use of mark_rect() with explicit x2/y2 bounds to create seamless gridded
    visualization
  - Added contour line overlay attempt using white point markers along level boundaries
  - Appropriate resolution (80x80 grid) provides smooth visual appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Contour line overlay is too subtle (size=3, opacity=0.4) to effectively show level
    boundaries - should be more prominent with larger size or higher opacity
  - The discrete color banding is not as visually distinct as traditional filled contours
    - consider using fewer levels or higher contrast between bands
  - Colorbar title shows Intensity in rendered image which is generic - the code shows
    f(x, y) but this appears not to render correctly
