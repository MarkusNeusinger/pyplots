review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended by spec
  - Smart sorting by improvement magnitude reveals patterns effectively
  - 'Clean color scheme using Python colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that are
    colorblind-safe'
  - Proper use of geom_segment for connecting lines with subtle gray color
  - Good text sizing following letsplot guidelines (title 24, axis titles 20, text
    16)
  - Y-axis grid disabled to reduce visual clutter for horizontal chart
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned far from data; could be integrated closer using legend_position
  - All data shows positive improvements only; including some negative or zero changes
    would demonstrate the plot type's full capability
