review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data transformation approach using melt() to create long-format data
    suitable for Altair declarative API
  - Clean normalization implementation allowing fair comparison across all dimensions
  - Good use of opacity (0.6) for handling 150 overlapping lines
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between species
  - Correct title format and professional axis labeling with units
  - Appropriate chart sizing (1500x850 with 3.0 scale factor) for target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Altair distinctive interactive features (tooltips, brush selection,
    or click interactions) that would make the parallel coordinates plot more exploratory
  - Dashed grid lines add visual noise in a line-heavy parallel coordinates visualization;
    a cleaner background would improve readability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization with
    four vertical axes representing Iris flower measurements: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal
    Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). Each axis shows normalized
    values from 0 to 1. Three species are color-coded: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor
    (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica (pink/coral #E85D75). 150 lines (50 per species)
    traverse across all four axes, with transparency (0.6 opacity) allowing overlapping
    patterns to be visible. The title "parallel-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center in gray. A legend on the right identifies the species with colored
    line markers. A subtle dashed grid (0.3 opacity) provides reference. The species
    show distinct clustering patterns: Setosa (blue) has notably lower Petal Length
    and Petal Width values, while Virginica (pink) tends toward higher values on those
    dimensions.'

        comment: Legend is well-placed on the right; however, the grid uses gridDash
          which creates visual noise in a parallel coordinates plot where the lines
          are the focus

  verdict: APPROVED
