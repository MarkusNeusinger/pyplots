review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world data scenario showing energy mix by country with meaningful
    variation
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Clean percentage labels positioned within each bar segment
  - Well-balanced layout with good use of canvas space at 4800x2700
  - Proper normalization of values to 100% even though input data already sums to
    100
  - Legend placement at bottom with 3-column layout is clean and non-intrusive
  weaknesses:
  - Nuclear segment shows limited variation (1-8% across all countries) - more diversity
    would better demonstrate the chart type
  - Font sizes in the library rules suggest smaller values (title_font_size=28) but
    implementation uses much larger (60) - while readable, it deviates from guidelines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing energy mix
    by country. Six countries are shown on the x-axis (USA, Germany, China, Brazil,
    Japan, India). Each bar is divided into three colored segments: blue (Fossil Fuels),
    yellow (Nuclear), and green (Renewable). All bars reach 100% height, with percentage
    labels displayed within each segment. The title "bar-stacked-percent · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis shows "Percentage (%)" from 0% to 100%,
    and the x-axis shows "Country". A legend at the bottom identifies the three energy
    sources. The chart clearly shows varying energy compositions - Brazil has the
    highest renewable share (81%), while Japan has the highest fossil fuel dependency
    (88%).'

        comment: Shows variety in proportions across countries. Brazil's high renewable
          vs Japan's high fossil creates good contrast. Nuclear segment is consistently
          small, could show more variation.
