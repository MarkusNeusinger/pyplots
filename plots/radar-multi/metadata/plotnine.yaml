review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using plotnine grammar of graphics by
    converting polar to Cartesian coordinates
  - Clean polygon layering with appropriate transparency (alpha=0.2) allowing overlap
    visibility
  - Well-structured gridlines (dashed circles) and spokes for reference
  - Good color choices with Python Blue and Yellow plus complementary colors
  - Realistic product comparison scenario with 6 meaningful attributes
  - Proper polygon closure by repeating first point
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed set - though data is deterministic, best practice is to include
    np.random.seed(42)
  - Color palette includes red and green which can be problematic for red-green colorblind
    users
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart comparing 4 products
    across 6 attributes (Support, Durability, Quality, Price, Design, Features). Four
    distinct colored polygons are shown: blue (Product A), yellow (Product B), red
    (Product C), and green (Product D). Each polygon is filled with ~0.2 alpha transparency,
    allowing overlapping areas to be visible. Circular dashed gray gridlines indicate
    value levels. Axis labels are positioned around the perimeter of the chart. The
    title "radar-multi · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend on the
    right identifies each product by color with marker symbols. Points are clearly
    marked at each vertex with connecting lines outlining each polygon.'

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot, aes, geom_polygon, geom_line,
          geom_point, geom_text) effectively. Creative workaround for radar chart
          by converting to Cartesian coordinates since plotnine doesn't have native
          polar coordinates. Could use more advanced theming.
  verdict: APPROVED
