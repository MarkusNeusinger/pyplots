review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of filled contours with custom colorscale transitioning from transparent
    white to yellow to blue
  - Smart combination of density contours with scatter point overlay provides context
    as recommended in spec
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate the plot purpose of finding density
    patterns
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output (scale=3)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Variable, Y Variable) rather than tied to a realistic
    context
  - Grid lines are too subtle (alpha 0.1) - consider alpha 0.2-0.3 for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density contour visualization with three
    distinct clusters. The colorscale transitions from transparent/cream at low density
    through yellow (#FFD43B) at medium density to dark blue (#306998/#1a3d5c) at high
    density. Three cluster centers are visible: one at approximately (2, 3), another
    at (5, 5), and a third at (7, 2.5). Semi-transparent scatter points are overlaid
    showing the underlying data distribution. The title "contour-density · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Axis labels "X Variable" and "Y Variable"
    are clearly displayed. A colorbar on the right shows the density scale from 0
    to ~45. The background is white with subtle grid lines.'

        comment: Uses Histogram2dContour which is Plotly-specific, but does not leverage
          Plotly's interactive features in the static output (hover tooltips would
          enhance HTML version)
  verdict: APPROVED
