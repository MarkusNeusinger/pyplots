review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with annotated mean/median, mode labels with arrows,
    and sample size — the viewer immediately understands the bimodal distribution
    pattern
  - 'Strong use of seaborn-distinctive features: rugplot for individual observations,
    separate kdeplot overlay, and set_theme with custom rc params'
  - Sophisticated visual design with custom theme, intentional color hierarchy (Python
    Blue primary, orange/green for statistics), and polished details (spine alpha,
    grid styling, facecolor)
  - Multimodal data generation that showcases histogram capabilities (central tendency,
    spread, bimodality, tail behavior)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  weaknesses:
  - Mean (74.8) and median (75.1) vertical lines nearly coincide, making them hard
    to distinguish visually — consider using data with greater mean/median separation
    to better showcase both reference lines
  - The Secondary mode ~92 pts annotation arrow points to the upper-right corner area
    rather than clearly to the secondary peak bars, making it slightly disconnected
    from its target
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of exam scores for 500 students,
    using blue (#306998) bars with white edges across 30 bins spanning approximately
    30 to 110 points on the x-axis. A dark blue KDE density curve overlays the histogram
    via a twin y-axis (with hidden ticks/labels). A subtle rug plot along the x-axis
    shows individual observations. Two vertical reference lines mark the mean (74.8,
    orange dashed) and median (75.1, green dash-dot), each with labeled annotation
    boxes. Arrow annotations call out the primary mode (~72 pts) and secondary mode
    (~92 pts). The title reads "histogram-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" and a sample
    size note "n = 500 students" appears in the upper right. The y-axis is labeled
    "Frequency (count)" and x-axis "Exam Score (points)". Top and right spines are
    removed, with a light gray grid on the y-axis only. The bimodal distribution is
    clearly visible with the larger peak around 70-75 and a secondary peak around
    90-95.
