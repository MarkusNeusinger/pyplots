review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive implementation of all spec requirements including efficient frontier,
    special portfolios, and Capital Market Line
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource for all data, ColorBar
    for Sharpe ratio legend, interactive tools'
  - Viridis colormap for Sharpe ratio is colorblind-accessible and visually effective
  - Text sizing appropriately scaled for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (portfolio_return, portfolio_risk, neg_sharpe_ratio) which
    violates the KISS structure guideline
  - Legend overlaps with data area in the top-left corner, reducing readability of
    some points
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. A scatter plot shows approximately 300 random portfolios colored
    using the Viridis colormap to indicate Sharpe ratio values (ranging from ~0.35
    to ~0.5 as shown by the colorbar on the right). The efficient frontier curve is
    rendered as a solid blue line (#306998) curving from the lower-left to upper-right.
    Two key portfolios are highlighted: a yellow star marking the Minimum Variance
    Portfolio (at approximately 0.05 risk, 0.04 return) and a red diamond marking
    the Maximum Sharpe Portfolio (at approximately 0.05 risk, 0.055 return). A dashed
    purple Capital Market Line extends from the risk-free rate tangent point through
    and beyond the efficient frontier. The title "frontier-efficient · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. X-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation)" ranging from 0 to
    ~0.25, Y-axis shows "Expected Return" ranging from ~0.02 to ~0.14. The background
    is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines.'
