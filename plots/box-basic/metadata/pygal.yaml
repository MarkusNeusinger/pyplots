review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choice with realistic salary distributions across departments
  - Proper use of Tukey box mode for standard box plot visualization
  - Clean implementation of outliers in Engineering and Sales departments
  - Good color palette that is accessible and visually distinct
  - Correct title format and proper axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box size is small relative to the large chart dimensions, making it less
    prominent
  - Outlier markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at this resolution
