review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of overlapping effect using grouping: false in plot
    options'
  - Colorblind-safe palette (yellow, purple, blue) with good transparency (0.55 alpha)
  - Clear, realistic data scenario with meaningful sample sizes in legend
  - Proper bin alignment across all three distributions
  - Good subtitle adding context to the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box is slightly isolated in upper right corner; could be positioned closer
    to the chart area
  - Y-axis label Frequency (Count) is slightly redundant
  - Image height is 2561px instead of target 2700px
