review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Campbell Diagram structure with all essential elements (mode curves, EO
    lines, critical intersections)
  - 'Strong visual hierarchy: solid colored modes vs dashed gray EO lines vs red diamond
    critical speeds'
  - Physically realistic turbine rotor scenario with proper mode naming conventions
  - Clean, well-organized code following the Highcharts Python library patterns
  - Thoughtful color palette and typography choices elevate the design above defaults
  - Critical speed intersection calculation is mathematically correct using sign-change
    detection
  weaknesses:
  - Engine order lines are somewhat faint (gray dashed against white) — could use
    slightly darker color or thicker lines for better visibility
  - Natural frequency curves are nearly flat, reducing visual drama; slightly more
    pronounced gyroscopic effects would make the diagram more visually interesting
    and educational
  - No on-chart labels for engine order lines (only legend) — the spec suggests labeling
    1x, 2x, 3x directly on the lines
  - LineSeries imported from series.area module instead of series.line — functionally
    works but not idiomatic
  - Interactive HTML and PNG export could be more concise
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram for a turbine rotor. The
    title reads "campbell-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in dark bold text, with
    a subtitle "Natural Frequencies vs Rotational Speed — Turbine Rotor" in lighter
    gray. The X-axis shows Rotational Speed from 0 to 6k (RPM) with 1k tick intervals,
    and the Y-axis shows Frequency (Hz) from 0 to 110 with 10 Hz tick intervals. Four
    natural frequency mode curves are plotted as solid colored lines: 1st Bending
    (dark blue, ~18-23 Hz, gently rising), 2nd Bending (green, ~42-45 Hz, gently falling),
    1st Torsional (purple, ~62-64 Hz, nearly flat with slight rise), and Axial (orange,
    ~77-78 Hz, nearly flat with slight decline). Three dashed gray diagonal engine
    order lines (1x, 2x, 3x) originate from the origin with increasing slopes. Red
    diamond markers indicate critical speed intersections where engine order lines
    cross mode curves. The legend is positioned in the upper-right corner with a floating
    white background and thin border, listing all series. The background is white
    with subtle dotted gridlines. Overall layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
