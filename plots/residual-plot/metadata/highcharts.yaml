review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts plotLines for zero line and threshold bands with clear
    labels
  - Good outlier detection and visual differentiation using diamond markers and contrasting
    color
  - Realistic housing price prediction context makes the residual analysis intuitive
  - Proper colorblind-safe palette (blue/red-orange instead of red-green)
  - Interactive HTML version generated alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis range extends too far (-100k to +100k) when data only reaches about ±60k,
    creating wasted vertical space
  - Threshold line labels (+2σ, -2σ, Zero Line) overlap with some data points and
    could be positioned at the right edge instead
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for the plot line labels to improve readability
