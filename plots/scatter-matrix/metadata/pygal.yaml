review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using PIL composite to build a scatter matrix from individual
    pygal charts
  - Excellent use of pygal.Histogram for diagonal cells showing univariate distributions
  - Good transparency handling (opacity=0.55) makes overlapping points distinguishable
  - Clean Iris-like dataset with visible positive and negative correlations
  - Proper title format following pyplots convention
  - Variable labels positioned on both left (rotated) and bottom edges as per spec
  - Square 3600x3600 format is appropriate for matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis tick labels within cells are somewhat small relative to the overall image
    size
  - Could benefit from subtle grid lines within scatter cells for reference
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter matrix visualization using the
    Iris-like dataset variables: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal
    Width. The title "scatter-matrix · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    in dark text. Each diagonal cell shows a histogram with blue bars representing
    the univariate distribution of that variable. Off-diagonal cells display scatter
    plots with blue dots (approximately dots_size=7) showing pairwise relationships
    between variables. The scatter points have good transparency (opacity ~0.55),
    making overlapping points distinguishable. Variable names appear as rotated labels
    on the left edge and horizontal labels along the bottom. The cells have a light
    gray (#f8f8f8) background. Clear correlation patterns are visible: positive correlations
    between Sepal Length, Petal Length, and Petal Width; negative correlation between
    Sepal Width and the others. The overall layout uses a 3600×3600 square format.'
