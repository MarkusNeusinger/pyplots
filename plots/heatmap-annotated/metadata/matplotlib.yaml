review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent automatic text contrast algorithm (white on dark, black on light backgrounds)
  - Realistic financial correlation matrix with meaningful relationships (Revenue-Profit
    positive, Profit-Expenses negative)
  - Perfect 2-decimal formatting for correlation coefficients
  - Clean square layout appropriate for symmetric matrices
  - Proper diverging colormap (RdBu_r) centered at zero
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic ("Variables" instead of "Financial Metrics")
  - Grid linewidth=2 is slightly heavy; alpha or linewidth=1 would be more subtle
  - Does not leverage advanced matplotlib features like matshow() or custom Normalize
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8×8 annotated correlation heatmap showing
    relationships between financial metrics: Revenue, Profit, Expenses, Growth, Risk,
    ROI, Debt, and Assets. The heatmap uses a diverging RdBu_r colormap (red for positive,
    blue for negative correlations) with values ranging from -1.0 to 1.0. Each cell
    contains a bold numerical annotation with 2 decimal places. Text color automatically
    contrasts with the background—white text on dark cells (high |correlation|), black
    text on light cells (low |correlation|). The diagonal shows 1.00 values (self-correlation)
    in dark red. A vertical colorbar on the right labeled "Correlation Coefficient"
    shows the value scale. X-axis labels are rotated 45° for readability. White grid
    lines separate cells cleanly.'
