review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent distribution variety demonstrating violin plot capabilities (normal,
    bimodal, skewed)
  - Clear colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Proper use of Highcharts PolygonSeries to create violin shapes with KDE
  - Includes median markers and IQR boxes as spec requires
  - Realistic test score scenario with appropriate data ranges
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Clean separation of violin shapes with no overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning at bottom overlaps slightly with x-axis title - could be better
    placed
  - The IQR boxes are very thin (box_width=0.05) and could be slightly wider for better
    visibility
  - Grid lines could be even more subtle (currently alpha=0.15, could use 0.1)
