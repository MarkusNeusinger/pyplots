review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular layout algorithm distributing seats proportionally across
    8 concentric rows
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and legend with seat counts
  - Good visual hierarchy with white-edged seat markers
  - Appropriate figure sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Majority threshold line at y=0 is misleading - it should either be removed or
    show where 201 seats falls visually in the arc arrangement
  - Marker size (s=120) slightly small for 400 data points at this resolution; s=150-180
    would improve visibility
  - Color palette includes blue and purple which may be difficult to distinguish for
    deuteranopia colorblindness
