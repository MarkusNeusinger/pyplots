review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic gene expression data scenario with proper biological context
    (tumor vs. normal, functional gene groups)
  - Clean implementation of clustered heatmap using scipy hierarchical clustering
    with Ward's method
  - Proper use of diverging colormap (RdBu_r) centered on zero for expression data
  - Well-organized code with gridspec for professional dendrogram + heatmap layout
  - Clear visual distinction between sample groups and gene clusters in the final
    visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit x-axis and y-axis labels (could add Samples and Genes labels)
  - Could add row/column color bars to annotate gene functional groups and sample
    types as suggested in spec
  - Tick label fontsize (14pt) slightly below the recommended 16pt for optimal legibility
    at full resolution
