review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of parallel coordinates from scratch using matplotlib
    primitives
  - Proper normalization to [0,1] range for fair comparison across dimensions
  - Clear color coding with colorblind-safe palette (Python blue, yellow, green)
  - Informative axis labels showing both dimension name and original value range
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.5) for overlapping lines
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper right overlaps some data lines; consider placing it
    outside the plot area or in a less obstructed corner
  - Line width of 2 could be increased to 2.5-3 for better visibility at full 4800x2700
    resolution
  image_description: 'The plot shows a parallel coordinates visualization with 4 vertical
    axes representing Iris dataset features: Sepal Length (4.3-7.9 cm), Sepal Width
    (2.0-4.4 cm), Petal Length (1.3-6.6 cm), and Petal Width (0.1-2.5 cm). Each observation
    is represented as a line connecting normalized values (0-1) across all axes. Three
    species are color-coded: Setosa (blue, #306998), Versicolor (yellow, #FFD43B),
    and Virginica (green, #4CAF50). The title reads "parallel-basic · matplotlib ·
    pyplots.ai". Lines use alpha=0.5 for transparency. A legend in the upper right
    identifies the species. The plot clearly shows the clustering patterns - Setosa
    (blue) has distinctly low petal length and width values, while Versicolor and
    Virginica show more overlap but are still distinguishable.'

        comment: Grid is horizontal only (y-axis) which is appropriate, but legend
          could be better positioned - currently in upper right which overlaps some
          data lines
