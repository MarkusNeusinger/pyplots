review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal dumbbell chart with proper before/after comparison visualization
  - Data sorted by improvement magnitude reveals patterns effectively
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with separate DataFrames for segments
    and points
  - Good use of categorical ordering to maintain sort order on y-axis
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Connecting lines appropriately thin and subtle as specified
  - Well-sized figure (16x9) with appropriate text sizes for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Missing np.random.seed(42) for reproducibility (even though data is deterministic,
    it is a code standard)
  - Horizontal grid lines removed but vertical grid lines kept - for a horizontal
    dumbbell chart, horizontal grid lines would help read values more easily
