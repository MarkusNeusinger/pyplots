review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent differentiation between critical speeds inside vs outside operating
    range using marker shape, size, opacity, and annotation styling — creates strong
    visual hierarchy
  - Sophisticated end-of-line label de-collision algorithm prevents overlap at the
    right edge
  - Rotated engine order labels with white background boxes are elegant and readable
  - Operating range shading with dotted boundaries is tasteful and informative
  - Linear interpolation for finding exact intersection points is mathematically sound
  - Comprehensive two-column legend covers all visual elements without cluttering
  weaknesses:
  - Right-edge mode labels for Axial and 1st Torsional are vertically close despite
    de-collision logic — the minimum gap could be slightly larger
  - Legend font size (11pt) is smaller than the recommended 16pt in library rules,
    though appropriate given 9 legend entries
  - Imports from three separate matplotlib submodules (lines, patches, ticker) adds
    minor verbosity
  image_description: The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with 5 natural frequency
    mode curves (1st Bending in dark blue, 2nd Bending in orange, 1st Torsional in
    cyan, Axial in purple, 3rd Bending in brown) plotted against rotational speed
    from 0 to 6,000 RPM on the x-axis and frequency from 0 to 120 Hz on the y-axis.
    Three dashed gray engine order lines (1x, 2x, 3x) extend diagonally from the origin
    with rotated labels on white background boxes. A light blue shaded band marks
    the operating range (2,500-4,500 RPM) with dotted vertical boundary lines and
    an italic "Operating Range" label at the bottom. Critical speed intersections
    outside the operating range appear as semi-transparent red circles, while those
    inside appear as larger red diamond markers with annotated mode labels in red-bordered
    boxes connected by arrow lines. End-of-line mode labels in bold matching colors
    appear at the right edge with vertical de-collision. The title reads "campbell-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in medium weight. A two-column legend in the upper-left
    distinguishes all element types. Top and right spines are removed, subtle grids
    are applied, and the x-axis uses thousand separators.
