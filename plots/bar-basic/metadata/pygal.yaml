  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - 'Strong color hierarchy: leader bar highlighted in Python Blue with muted tones
    for others provides clear visual emphasis'
  - Idiomatic pygal usage with per-bar color dictionaries, rounded bars, and value
    formatter
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario with good value variation across categories
  - Full spec compliance including correct title format and all requested features
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization could be improved — notable empty space around the plot area,
    bars could be wider
  - No annotations or callout text to strengthen the data storytelling beyond the
    color highlight
  - Some unnecessary chart configuration options (dots_size, inner_radius, stroke)
    that do not apply to bar charts add code verbosity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 7 bars representing
    quarterly website traffic by marketing channel. The X-axis is labeled "Channel"
    with categories: Organic Search, Direct, Social Media, Email, Referral, Paid Ads,
    and Affiliates. The Y-axis is labeled "Visits (Q4 2025)" with ticks at 0, 30,000,
    60,000, 90,000, 120,000, and 150,000. The leading bar (Organic Search, 142,500)
    is highlighted in a darker Python Blue (#306998), while the remaining 6 bars are
    rendered in a muted light blue (#A8C4D8). Each bar has a comma-formatted value
    label displayed on top. The title reads "bar-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" centered
    at the top. Background is white with subtle horizontal grid lines. Bars have slightly
    rounded corners and consistent spacing. The data is non-monotonic, providing good
    visual variation.'
