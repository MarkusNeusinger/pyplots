review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using XY chart to construct violin shapes manually
  - Good KDE implementation using Silverman's rule for bandwidth selection
  - Excellent color contrast between violin fills and swarm points
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  - Realistic experimental scenario with appropriate data ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears despite show_legend=False, causing redundancy with x-axis labels
  - Swarm point colors in the rendered image don't match the intended stroke_style
    colors
  - Some swarm points overlap rather than spreading horizontally to avoid overlap
    as specified
  image_description: 'The plot displays a violin plot with overlaid swarm points showing
    reaction times (ms) across 4 experimental conditions (Control, Low Dose, Medium
    Dose, High Dose). Each violin is rendered with a semi-transparent fill in distinct
    colors: light blue for Control, light orange for Low Dose, light yellow for Medium
    Dose, and light cyan for High Dose. Swarm points are overlaid in contrasting colors
    (green, purple, pink, and brown/dark red respectively). The title "violin-swarm
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)"
    ranging from ~50 to ~650, and the X-axis shows "Experimental Condition" with category
    labels. The violins show different distribution shapes with varying central tendencies.
    A legend appears at the bottom showing the four conditions. The plot uses horizontal
    grid lines for reference.'
