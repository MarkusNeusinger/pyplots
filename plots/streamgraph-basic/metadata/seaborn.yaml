review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of centered baseline streamgraph algorithm
  - Beautiful color scheme combining Python branding colors with colorblind-safe palette
  - Realistic data with seasonal patterns and trends that demonstrate the visualization
    effectively
  - Clean separation between layers using white edge lines
  - Well-executed seaborn styling with despine and subtle grid
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between for core plotting rather than native seaborn functions
    (acceptable since seaborn lacks native streamgraph support)
  - Missing smooth interpolation/spline curves - uses linear interpolation between
    points rather than flowing curves as suggested in spec notes
