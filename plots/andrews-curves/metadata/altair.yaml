  strengths:
  - Correct Fourier series implementation for Andrews curves transformation
  - Clear visual separation between iris species demonstrating the clustering capability
  - Proper data normalization using StandardScaler as recommended in spec
  - Clean, declarative Altair code with appropriate encoding types
  - Title format follows the required spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern with
    informative subtitle
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.4) for overlapping curves as recommended
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could benefit from a semi-transparent background for better contrast against
    the curves
  - Yellow color (#FFD43B) could be slightly less bright for better visibility on
    white background
  - Could add tooltips to enable interactive exploration of individual observations
  image_description: 'The plot displays Andrews curves for the Iris dataset with 150
    observations transformed into Fourier series curves. Three iris species are color-coded:
    Setosa in yellow/gold (#FFD43B), Versicolor in blue (#306998), and Virginica in
    olive green (#6B8E23). The x-axis shows "t (radians)" ranging from approximately
    -π to π (-3.4 to 3.2), and the y-axis displays "Andrews Curve Value" ranging from
    about -4 to 6. The title follows the required format: "Iris Classification · andrews-curves
    · altair · pyplots.ai" with a descriptive subtitle. The legend is positioned in
    the upper right corner. The curves demonstrate clear visual separation between
    species, with Setosa (yellow) forming a distinct cluster near y=0, while Versicolor
    and Virginica show overlapping wave patterns at higher amplitudes.'

        comment: Curves are visible with appropriate opacity (0.4). strokeWidth=2
          works well for the data density. Very slight difficulty distinguishing individual
          curves in dense regions.

        comment: Blue, yellow, and olive green provide reasonable distinction. Yellow
          on white background could be slightly challenging in some contexts.

        comment: No visible grid (which is acceptable for this plot type), legend
          is well-placed but could benefit from a background for better contrast.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding with detail for grouping curves,
          proper mark_line with opacity. Could leverage more Altair-specific features
          like tooltips or interactive selection.
