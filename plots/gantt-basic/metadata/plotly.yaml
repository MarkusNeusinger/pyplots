review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly.express px.timeline for Gantt chart creation - the right
    tool for the job
  - Clear visual hierarchy with tasks sorted by start date and y-axis reversed for
    natural top-to-bottom reading
  - Today marker line with annotation provides practical project tracking reference
  - Color-coded categories with custom colorblind-safe palette
  - Clean implementation with proper font sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic software development project scenario with believable task dependencies
    and overlaps
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided, leveraging Plotly interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha=0.1) - increasing to 0.2-0.3 would improve readability
  - No hover customization to show task details in interactive version
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart titled "Software Development
    Project · gantt-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" with 12 horizontal bars representing
    project tasks. The x-axis shows "Timeline (2025)" with dates from Jan 12 to Apr
    20, formatted as "Mon DD". The y-axis is labeled "Project Tasks" with task names
    including Requirements Analysis, System Design, Database Design, UI/UX Design,
    Backend Development, Frontend Development, API Integration, Unit Testing, Integration
    Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Documentation, and Deployment & Launch. Five
    categories are color-coded: Planning (dark blue #306998), Design (yellow #FFD43B),
    Development (teal #4ECDC4), Testing (coral/salmon #FF6B6B), and Deployment (light
    green #95E1A3). A red dashed vertical line labeled "Today" marks Feb 20. The legend
    is positioned horizontally at the top. Tasks are sorted by start date with overlapping
    bars clearly showing concurrent activities.'
