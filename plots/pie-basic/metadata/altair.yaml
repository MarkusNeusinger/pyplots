review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with theta encoding for pie chart
  - Clean layered approach combining pie slices and text labels
  - Good colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue
  - Tooltips add interactivity value to HTML output
  - Well-proportioned square format suitable for pie charts
  - White stroke separation enhances visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing exploded slice for emphasis on key category (mentioned in spec notes)
  - Title could include a descriptive subtitle for context
  - Pie chart slightly off-center due to legend placement
  image_description: 'The pie chart displays a "Budget allocation by department" scenario
    with 6 department slices. The dominant slice is Engineering (Python Blue, #306998)
    at 35.0%, followed by Marketing (teal, 20.0%), Operations (coral, 18.0%), Sales
    (coral/pink, 15.0%), HR (yellow, 7.0%), and R&D (light teal, 5.0%). Percentage
    labels are positioned outside each slice in bold black text. A legend titled "Department"
    is placed on the right side listing all categories. White strokes separate the
    slices clearly. The title "pie-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top. The chart uses a square format with good proportions.'
