review:
  strengths:
  - 'All five previous review issues addressed: diverse distributions, four distinct
    colors, ColumnDataSource, HoverTool, tightened y-range'
  - Full spec compliance with all required features (quartile markers, mirrored density,
    median line)
  - Excellent data quality with skewed, bimodal, and normal distributions demonstrating
    violin plot strengths
  - Clean, idiomatic Bokeh code with ColumnDataSource and interactive HTML export
  - Strong visual refinement with removed chart junk, subtle grid, and currency formatting
  weaknesses:
  - All violins have equal visual weight — no emphasis on the most interesting distributions
    (Sales skew, Support bimodality)
  - Title styling could be more sophisticated (no color differentiation, font weight,
    or subtitle)
  - Uniform alpha (0.7) across all violins misses an opportunity for visual hierarchy
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes arranged horizontally for
    departments: Engineering (steel blue #306998), Marketing (orange #E8943A), Sales
    (teal #2A9D8F), and Support (coral #E76F6F). Each violin shows a mirrored KDE
    density profile with a white inner box (Q1-Q3), a bold black median line, and
    whiskers extending to 1.5xIQR with small caps. Engineering is a symmetric normal
    shape centered around ~$85k. Marketing is symmetric normal centered ~$65k with
    a thin KDE tail extending low. Sales is distinctly right-skewed with a sharp peak
    extending to ~$150k, reflecting the exponential commission-based distribution.
    Support shows a clear bimodal shape with two bulges around ~$42k and ~$62k representing
    junior/senior tiers. The y-axis is formatted as USD currency ($20,000-$140,000+)
    with subtle dashed gridlines at alpha 0.2. The x-grid is removed, tick marks are
    removed, axis lines are light gray (#cccccc), and the outline is removed. Title
    "violin-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is displayed top-left at 36pt. All text is
    clearly readable with explicit font sizes (28pt labels, 22pt ticks).'
