review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between segments
  - Clear percentage labels within each segment making exact values readable
  - Professional title format and informative subtitle
  - Well-structured legend placement at bottom
  - Realistic market share scenario that clearly demonstrates the 100% stacking concept
  - Good use of Highcharts native percent stacking feature
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis has too many tick marks (every 2%) creating visual clutter; consider using
    10% or 20% intervals
  - Grid could be more subtle with wider spacing for cleaner appearance
