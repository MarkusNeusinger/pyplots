review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using pygal XY chart to simulate a chord diagram
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction
  - Proper bidirectional flow data representing realistic migration patterns
  - Clean legend placement at the bottom with all continents identified
  - Chord thickness proportional to flow magnitude as specified
  - Title follows the exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Not a true chord diagram - uses lines connecting points rather than arcs on circle
    perimeter
  - Pygal lacks native chord diagram support so this is an approximation
  - SVG post-processing to inject labels adds unnecessary complexity
  - Node markers on the perimeter are very small and hard to see
