review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper rebasing logic using geometric Brownian motion
  - Excellent use of seaborn lineplot with hue parameter for automatic legend handling
  - Good color palette choice with distinct, accessible colors
  - Reference line at 100 clearly indicates starting point
  - Proper date formatting with rotated labels
  weaknesses:
  - sns.set_style() is called after plt.subplots(), which may not fully apply the
    style to the figure
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features (e.g., sns.set_context() for scaling)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-line chart comparing rebased stock
    prices for four symbols (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, SPY) over approximately one year (Jan
    2024 to Jan 2025). The chart uses a white grid background with four distinct colored
    lines: blue for AAPL, red/orange for GOOGL, green for MSFT, and yellow for SPY.
    A horizontal gray dashed reference line at y=100 marks the starting point. The
    title "line-stock-comparison · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis
    is labeled "Rebased Price (Start = 100)" and ranges from approximately 80 to 160+.
    The x-axis shows dates with rotated labels. A legend in the upper left identifies
    all four symbols. The lines show varying performance with SPY (yellow) showing
    the strongest gains, followed by GOOGL, AAPL, and MSFT showing the weakest relative
    performance ending below the starting point.'
