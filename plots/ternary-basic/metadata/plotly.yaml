review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native Scatterternary for ternary diagrams
  - Clean, well-proportioned layout with proper margins
  - Hover template provides useful interactive tooltips with formatted percentages
  - Font sizes perfectly scaled for 4800x2700 output
  - White marker outlines improve point visibility in overlapping areas
  - Realistic soil science context (sand/silt/clay classification)
  - Proper normalization ensures compositions sum to 100%
  weaknesses:
  - Data is purely random without meaningful patterns - could show soil type clusters
    (sandy, silty, clayey regions)
  - Library features underutilized - could add color encoding by a fourth variable
    or use marker size variation
  - Slight marker overlap in dense central regions of the triangle
