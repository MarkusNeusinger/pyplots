review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout using gggrid with proper 70/30 height ratio as specified
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/orange) applied consistently across both panes
  - Human-readable volume labels (3.9M, 6.1M, 8.3M) improve readability
  - Clean implementation of candlesticks using geom_segment for both wicks and bodies
  - Proper ggplot2 grammar of graphics style leveraging lets-plot strengths
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function format_volume() violates KISS principle (code should be flat script)
  - Crosshair cursor mentioned in comments but only available in HTML output, not
    PNG
  - Minor visual gap between the two panes could be tighter
