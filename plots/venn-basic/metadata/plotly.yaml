review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly graph_objects for custom shape drawing with go.Scatter
    fill=toself
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors (blue, yellow, green) at appropriate
    transparency
  - All 7 Venn regions labeled with counts and descriptive text for exclusive regions
  - Proper mathematical calculation of exclusive region sizes
  - Outputs both static PNG and interactive HTML leveraging Plotly interactivity capability
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining the data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Square format (1200x1200 scaled to 3600x3600) deviates from recommended 1600x900
    landscape in library rules (minor, justified for this plot type)
