review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layering to compose error bars from rule + tick marks
    for caps
  - Clean demonstration of asymmetric error bars (Treatment C and D show different
    upper/lower bounds)
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good font sizing throughout (18pt labels, 22pt titles, 28pt main title)
  - Subtle dashed grid that does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates unnecessary whitespace at bottom since all values
    are above 20
  - No tooltip added for interactivity (Altair strength not fully utilized)
