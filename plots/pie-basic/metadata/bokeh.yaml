review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - 'All spec requirements implemented: percentage labels on slices, distinct colors,
    legend, and explosion effect on the largest slice'
  - Smart color contrast handling (dark text on yellow slice, white text on darker
    slices)
  - Clean pie chart appearance with hidden axes/grid and white slice borders
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with appropriate category names
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears relatively small compared to the large canvas size; legend text
    could be scaled up for better readability at full resolution
  - Code uses manual loops instead of ColumnDataSource which is more idiomatic Bokeh
