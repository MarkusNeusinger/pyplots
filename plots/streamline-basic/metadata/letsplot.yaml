review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with proper layering of geom_path,
    color scales, and theming
  - Color gradient from blue to yellow effectively communicates field strength magnitude
  - Clean integration using scipy solve_ivp for streamline computation produces smooth,
    continuous paths
  - Good visual balance with appropriate line width and alpha for visibility
  - Proper output at scale=3 for high-resolution PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function velocity_field violates KISS principle (should inline the calculation
    or use lambda)
  - Title format adds descriptive prefix instead of using exact spec-id format
  - Could benefit from arrow indicators to show flow direction along streamlines
  image_description: The plot displays a vortex flow field with 8 concentric circular
    streamlines centered at the origin. The color gradient transitions from dark blue
    (inner, low field strength ~0.5) through gray to golden yellow (outer, high field
    strength ~2.5). The streamlines are smooth, closed circles representing the rotational
    vector field u=-y, v=x. The title "Vortex Flow Field · streamline-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Axes range from -3 to 3 on both X Position
    and Y Position. A colorbar legend on the right shows "Field Strength" values.
    The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle grid lines.
