review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of clustered heatmap using pure plotnine grammar of graphics
  - 'Creative solution: manually constructing dendrograms with geom_segment since
    plotnine lacks native clustermap'
  - Proper use of scipy hierarchical clustering with Ward method
  - Diverging color scheme correctly centered at zero with Python-branded colors
  - Clean visual layout with well-proportioned dendrograms relative to heatmap
  - Realistic gene expression scenario demonstrating clear clustering patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Sample labels at bottom could be slightly larger for better readability at full
    resolution
  - Code is necessarily complex due to manual dendrogram coordinate calculation
