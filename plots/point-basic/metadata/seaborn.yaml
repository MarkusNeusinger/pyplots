review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation for category label readability as recommended
    in spec
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-sized points and error bars with caps
  - Helpful reference line showing overall mean with legend explanation
  - Good use of varying confidence interval widths to demonstrate uncertainty differences
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars drawn manually with matplotlib errorbar instead of using seaborn native
    confidence interval features
  - All confidence intervals are symmetric around estimates; real-world CIs are often
    asymmetric
