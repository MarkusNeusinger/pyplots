review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wind rose using manual polygon geometry in plotnine
  - Clean color progression from cool (calm) to warm (strong winds) following meteorological
    convention
  - North correctly positioned at top (90 degrees in mathematical coordinates)
  - Well-organized code with clear data structure and meaningful comments
  - Appropriate use of categorical ordering for legend consistency
  - Good gridline design with dashed style and appropriate transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Frequency percentages positioning could be improved - labels are slightly offset
    and may be confusing
  - Small innermost wedge segments are harder to visually distinguish due to their
    size
  image_description: The plot displays a wind rose chart with 8 directional spokes
    (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) arranged in a polar layout with North at the top.
    Each spoke contains stacked colored wedge segments representing wind speed bins.
    The colors progress from dark blue (0-5 m/s, calm winds) through light blue (5-10
    m/s), green (10-15 m/s), yellow (15-20 m/s), to orange (20+ m/s, strong winds).
    The SW direction shows the longest spokes, indicating prevailing winds from that
    direction. Concentric dashed gridlines at 5%, 10%, and 15% frequency are visible,
    with percentage labels positioned near the N spoke. The title "windrose-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend on the right side labeled
    "Wind Speed" shows all 5 speed categories with their colors and units (m/s). Direction
    labels (N, NE, E, etc.) are positioned outside the chart in bold black text. The
    background is clean white.

        comment: 'Title is clear at ~24pt, direction labels are bold and readable,

        comment: Wedges are clearly visible with good alpha (0.9), white borders separate
          segments well. Small gaps between adjacent direction wedges aid readability.
          Minor deduction for very small innermost wedge segments being slightly harder
          to distinguish.

        comment: Color progression from blue→green→yellow→orange is colorblind-friendly
          (avoids pure red-green differentiation). Sequential color scheme is intuitive.

        comment: '"Frequency (%)" label is present and italicized. Wind speed legend
          includes units (m/s). However, this is a polar plot without traditional

        comment: Uses plotnine grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_polygon + geom_line
          + geom_text + theme). Manual polygon construction is necessary since plotnine
          lacks native coord_polar. Shows good understanding of the library but the
          workaround is complex.
  verdict: APPROVED
