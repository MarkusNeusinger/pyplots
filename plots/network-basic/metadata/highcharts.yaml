review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts networkgraph module with force-directed layout algorithm
  - Colorblind-safe palette distinguishes 4 community groups effectively
  - Node degree-based sizing adds meaningful visual encoding
  - Cross-group bridge connections demonstrate network connectivity patterns
  - Clean inline JS embedding for headless Chrome rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Network graph occupies only ~25-30% of canvas; should scale up significantly to
    fill more space
  - 'Title format incorrect: should be "network-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" without
    "Social Network" prefix'
  - Missing legend to explain what the 4 colors represent (group membership)
  - Some node labels appear detached or nodes are barely visible (Leo, Eve, Mia appear
    as floating text)
