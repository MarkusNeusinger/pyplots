review:
  strengths:
  - Creative static representation of drilldown concept using side-by-side bar groups
  - Good use of section headers to simulate breadcrumb navigation
  - Value labels on bars provide precise comparison capability
  - Clean readable color scheme with Python-themed colors
  - Proper hierarchical data structure with parent-child relationships
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels Americas and Asia Pacific appear slightly crowded/touching
  - Large gap between the two bar groups creates visual imbalance - consider reducing
    offset or using faceting
  - Legend is completely hidden - a minimal legend could help explain color scheme
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static drilldown visualization with two
    groups of bar charts side-by-side. On the left side, there are 4 bars representing
    "All Regions" (Americas: 720, Asia Pacific: 713, Europe: 610, MEA: 220) with distinct
    colors (blue, blue, yellow, orange). On the right side, there are 4 bars showing
    the "Americas" breakdown by country (Brazil: 85, Canada: 120, Mexico: 65, USA:
    450) in various blue shades. The title "bar-drilldown · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed in blue at the top. Section headers "1. All Regions" and "2. All
    > Americas" appear above each group with yellow highlight boxes. The Y-axis shows
    "Sales ($ millions)" and value labels appear above each bar. The layout uses a
    clean minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_bar, geom_text, geom_segment, scale_fill_manual,
          theme customization. Good but not exceptional plotnine usage.
