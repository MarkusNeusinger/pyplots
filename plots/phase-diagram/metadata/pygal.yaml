review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of phase space concepts with both damped and undamped
    trajectories
  - Clean visual distinction between the spiral (damped) and closed loop (limit cycle)
    behaviors
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color scheme (blue and yellow)
  - Proper mathematical implementation of damped harmonic oscillator using Euler integration
  - Good use of pygal custom styling for large canvas rendering
  weaknesses:
  - The equilibrium point marker at origin is quite small and could be more prominent
  - The undamped oscillator trajectory shows some numerical drift (not a perfect ellipse
    due to Euler method)
