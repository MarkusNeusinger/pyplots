  strengths:
  - Full spec compliance with all required features (quartile markers, mirrored density,
    median line)
  - Realistic salary-by-department data with meaningful distribution differences across
    categories
  - Strong visual refinement (removed grids, subtle y-grid, no outlines, cleaned tick
    marks, light axis lines)
  - Perfect code quality with clean KISS structure and reproducible seed
  - Dual PNG+HTML output leveraging Bokeh strengths
  weaknesses:
  - All four distributions are symmetric normal - does not showcase violin plot key
    advantage of revealing distribution shape (skewness, multimodality)
  - Color palette uses only two hue families making within-pair categories hard to
    distinguish
  - Does not use ColumnDataSource as recommended by Bokeh best practices
  - HTML output lacks HoverTool, missing opportunity for Bokeh interactive strengths
  - Y-axis range extends well below data range creating wasted vertical space
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes arranged horizontally across
    departments: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Support. The violins alternate
    between two color families — steel blue (#306998, #4B8BBE) for Engineering and
    Sales, and golden yellow (#FFD43B, #FFE873) for Marketing and Support — all at
    0.7 alpha. Each violin shows a mirrored KDE density profile with a white inner
    box (Q1–Q3), a bold black median line, and whiskers extending to 1.5×IQR with
    small caps. The y-axis is formatted as USD currency ($20,000–$140,000) with dashed
    subtle gridlines. Engineering is centered highest (~$85k), Sales is widest (~$70k,
    std=20k), Marketing is mid-range (~$65k), and Support is the narrowest and lowest
    (~$50k). The title "violin-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears top-left. Background
    is white with no x-grid, no outline, and light gray axis lines.'
