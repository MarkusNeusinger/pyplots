review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with proper colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow)
  - Clear differentiation between raw data (semi-transparent) and rolling average
    (bold)
  - Proper title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Realistic temperature data with seasonal trend that effectively demonstrates the
    rolling average concept
  - Rolling average properly shorter than raw data due to window requirements
  - Well-sized text elements for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis grid line alpha at 0.3 is slightly too prominent (0.2 would be more subtle)
  - Raw temperature line could be slightly thicker (current 3px) for better visibility
    against the rolling average
