review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with proper histnorm=probability
    density normalization
  - KDE overlay adds valuable context and follows spec suggestion for reference curve
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color choices with high contrast between histogram and density curve
  - Proper use of scipy.stats.gaussian_kde for smooth density estimation
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity is slightly too subtle (0.1) - could be 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - Bimodal distribution could be more visually distinct to better showcase density
    histogram capabilities
  - Could add hover templates to enhance Plotly interactive features
