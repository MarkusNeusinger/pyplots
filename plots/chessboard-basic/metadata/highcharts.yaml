review:
  strengths:
  - Correct chess convention with h1 as light square
  - Classic cream/brown color scheme is visually appealing and colorblind-safe
  - Clean algebraic notation labels (a-h, 1-8)
  - Proper 1:1 aspect ratio for square proportions
  - Square borders enhance visual clarity
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Selenium export setup adds complexity (though necessary for Highcharts PNG export)
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features for enhanced interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a classic 8x8 chess board rendered as a heatmap
    with alternating cream (#F0D9B5) and brown (#B58863) squares. The title "chessboard-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold text. Row labels (1-8) are
    positioned on the left Y-axis, and column labels (a-h) are at the bottom X-axis.
    The chess convention is correctly followed with h1 (bottom-right corner) being
    a light/cream square and a1 (bottom-left) being a dark/brown square. Each square
    has a dark gray border (#333333) for clear delineation. The board maintains a
    proper 1:1 square aspect ratio. The legend is appropriately disabled since the
    color encoding is self-explanatory.
