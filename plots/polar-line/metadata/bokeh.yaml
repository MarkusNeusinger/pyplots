review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent simulation of polar coordinates in Bokeh (which lacks native polar support)
    using manual Cartesian conversion
  - Clean, readable hour labels around the perimeter with good spacing
  - Appropriate data scenario (wind speed pattern) that naturally fits polar/cyclical
    visualization
  - Good color contrast between the two series (blue/yellow)
  - Properly closed loops connecting back to starting point
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis label for radial dimension (could add Wind Speed m/s text annotation)
  - Radius labels (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) positioned only on positive X-axis could be more
    prominent
