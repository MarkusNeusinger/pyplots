review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of custom ternary coordinate system with proper Cartesian
    transformation
  - Manual KDE computation using Scott's bandwidth rule is well-implemented
  - Clean polygon-based density visualization with proper masking for triangle bounds
  - Sophisticated grid line construction parallel to all three edges
  - Uses lets-plot's ggplot2 grammar effectively with layer composition
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more prominent (currently quite subtle at alpha=0.3)
  - Spec mentions contour lines at key density levels as a consideration - not implemented
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density diagram for sediment composition
    (Sand/Silt/Clay) inside an equilateral triangle. The triangle has a blue (#306998)
    outline with vertex labels "Sand" at bottom-left, "Silt" at bottom-right, and
    "Clay" at top. The density heatmap uses the viridis colormap, transitioning from
    dark purple (low density ~1) through blue/teal to yellow/green (high density ~3+).
    Three distinct density clusters are visible: one near the Sand vertex (bottom-left),
    one near the Silt vertex area (center-bottom-right showing high yellow density),
    and one near the Clay vertex (top). Subtle gray grid lines at 20%/40%/60%/80%
    intervals are visible beneath the density layer. A vertical colorbar labeled "Density"
    appears on the right side. The title "Sediment Composition · ternary-density ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold blue text. The overall
    layout uses a 16:9 aspect ratio with clean whitespace.'
