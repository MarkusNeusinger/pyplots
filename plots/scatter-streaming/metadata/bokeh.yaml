review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of streaming data through opacity and size gradients
  - Clear highlighting of newest points with ring markers
  - Realistic sensor data scenario (temperature vs humidity)
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text is quite small relative to the large canvas size
  - Could leverage Bokeh actual streaming/callback features for HTML output
  - The oldest points (alpha=0.15) may be slightly too faint
  image_description: The plot displays a streaming scatter plot showing simulated
    sensor data with Temperature (°C) on the x-axis (range ~20-22.5) and Relative
    Humidity (%) on the y-axis (range ~55-59). The visualization effectively demonstrates
    a streaming data effect through an opacity gradient where older points appear
    lighter/more transparent (faded light blue) and newer points appear darker/more
    opaque (solid blue). Point sizes also increase from older to newer points. The
    5 most recent points are highlighted with distinctive blue ring markers and labeled
    in a legend as "Newest Points" in the top-left corner. The title "scatter-streaming
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in blue at the top. The background is a light gray
    (#fafafa) with dashed gray grid lines. The data shows a random walk pattern typical
    of sensor readings with cumulative drift.
