review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of LineCollection for gradient color-encoded path showing trail
    progression
  - Clear start/end point markers with distinct colors (green circle, red square)
    and white edge highlights
  - Direction arrows placed at intervals effectively indicate travel direction
  - Good use of viridis colormap which is colorblind-safe
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis displays offset notation (-1.223e2) instead of full longitude values, which
    reduces readability
  - No geographic basemap included for spatial context as mentioned in spec notes
  image_description: The plot displays a hiking trail route path visualization with
    coordinates in the San Francisco Bay Area (approximately 37.71-37.79 latitude,
    -122.40 to -122.33 longitude). The path is rendered as a continuous line with
    color gradient from dark purple (start, value 0) through blue, teal, green to
    yellow (end, value ~149), using the viridis colormap to show trail progression.
    The winding path forms an interesting figure-eight-like pattern with multiple
    curves, simulating a realistic hiking trail. A large green circle marker indicates
    the start point in the upper-left area, while a red square marker shows the end
    point in the upper-right portion. Five direction arrows placed along the path
    indicate the travel direction. The colorbar on the right shows "Trail Progress"
    ranging from 0 to ~149. The title reads "map-route-path · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. Axes are labeled "Longitude" (x-axis) and "Latitude" (y-axis) with
    appropriate tick marks. A subtle dashed grid with low opacity provides visual
    reference. The x-axis uses scientific notation offset (-1.223e2) for longitude
    values.
