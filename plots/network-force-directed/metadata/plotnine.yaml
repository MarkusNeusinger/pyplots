review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout algorithm implementation that creates clear cluster
    separation
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics to layer edges then nodes
  - Appropriate distinction between internal edges (solid) and bridge edges (dashed)
  - Node sizing by degree effectively highlights more connected individuals
  - Clean professional appearance with well-chosen color palette
  - Realistic team collaboration scenario that demonstrates the plot type well
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra context; should be just spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
  - Edge thickness does not vary by weight as suggested in spec notes
  - Internal edge alpha (0.4) is quite low making some connections hard to see
