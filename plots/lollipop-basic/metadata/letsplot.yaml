review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimalist lollipop chart that perfectly matches the spec requirements
  - Excellent use of geom_segment + geom_point combination for the lollipop effect
  - Data sorted by value improves readability as recommended in spec
  - Well-chosen realistic business context (product category sales)
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  - Removed x-axis gridlines for cleaner look
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis gridlines could be more subtle (add alpha or lighter color)
  - Could demonstrate more lets-plot specific features like interactive tooltips
