review:
  strengths:
  - Implements proper maze generation algorithm (Kruskal's with union-find)
  - Correctly creates concentric ring structure with varying sector counts
  - Uses appropriate square aspect ratio (3600x3600) for circular maze
  - Good code organization with clear comments
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Entry gap on outer perimeter and goal at center as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Wall lines are too thin for print-friendly output as specified in requirements
  - Entry marker (small blue triangle) is barely visible and positioned oddly
  - Goal marker (red circle) is very small and hard to see at the center
  - Legend placement is poor and distracts from the maze visualization
  - The rendering appears as connected line segments rather than solid walls
  - XY chart approach creates jagged-looking arcs rather than smooth curves
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circular maze with 7 concentric rings. The
    maze walls are rendered in dark gray/black lines forming both circular arcs (ring
    walls) and radial walls dividing sectors. The maze shows a complex network of
    passages created using Kruskal''s spanning tree algorithm. At the center, there
    is a small red circle indicating the goal. On the right side at the outer edge,
    a small blue triangle marker points inward to indicate the entry point. The title
    "maze-circular · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend in the
    top-left corner shows three items: Walls (dark), Entry (blue), and Goal (red).
    The background is white, and the overall layout is centered on the square canvas.'

          for this type of visualization - primarily designed for charts, not maze
