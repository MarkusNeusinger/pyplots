review:
  strengths:
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with politically neutral party names
  - Legend displays party names with seat counts clearly
  - Title includes helpful context about total seats and majority threshold
  - Good canvas sizing and overall layout proportions
  weaknesses:
  - Does NOT render individual seats as dots - shows solid arc segments instead of
    the specified individual dots or segments per seat
  - Majority threshold line from code is not visible in the output
  - The XY chart approach with seat positions does not produce the expected parliament
