review:
  strengths:
  - Clean hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Intelligent label visibility logic that hides labels for narrow rectangles to
    prevent overlap
  - Good color scheme with Python-themed colors (blue/yellow) that are colorblind-safe
  - Proper horizontal orientation with root at top as specified
  - Well-structured code using stack-based traversal instead of recursion
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be more descriptive (e.g., "Hierarchy Level" instead of just "Level")
  - Some empty space at the bottom of the canvas could be better utilized
  - Several level 3 labels are hidden (Reports, Contracts, Letters, Receipts, 2024,
    2023, Movies, DataViz, Frontend, Backend) - while this prevents overlap, it reduces
    information density
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal icicle chart representing a file
    system hierarchy. At the top is a large dark blue rectangle labeled "root" (level
    0). Below it are three yellow rectangles for "Documents", "Media", and "Projects"
    (level 1), sized proportionally to their values. Level 2 shows light blue rectangles
    for subfolders: Work, Personal (under Documents), Photos, Videos (under Media),
    and Python, Web (under Projects). The deepest level 3 shows gray rectangles for
    items like Clips and ML (visible labels), while many level 3 labels are hidden
    due to narrow widths. White borders separate all rectangles. A legend on the right
    shows levels 0-3 with corresponding colors. The title "icicle-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears in the top left.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_rect and geom_text, scale_fill_manual,
          but icicle isn't a native lets-plot chart type so it's manually constructed
  verdict: APPROVED
