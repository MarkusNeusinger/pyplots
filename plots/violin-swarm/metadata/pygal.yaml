review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using pygal XY chart to manually construct violin
    shapes with KDE
  - Clean swarm point positioning algorithm that spreads points within violin boundaries
  - Good use of pygal Style customization for proper sizing and colors
  - Semi-transparent violins allow swarm points to remain visible
  - Appropriate data scenario (reaction times) with realistic values
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions instead of flat KISS structure (compute_kde and compute_swarm_positions)
  - Could use more contrasting colors between violins and swarm points for better
    differentiation
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes with overlaid swarm points
    representing reaction times across experimental conditions (Control, Treatment
    A, Treatment B, Treatment C). The violins are rendered in a light blue color (#306998
    with transparency) showing kernel density estimation. Darker blue dots (#1a4d75)
    are overlaid as swarm points within each violin, horizontally spread to avoid
    overlap. The Y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 100
    to 500ms. The X-axis displays "Experimental Condition" with four category labels.
    The title follows the required format: "violin-swarm · pygal · pyplots.ai". Background
    is white with subtle horizontal guide lines. Each condition shows different distribution
    shapes - Control is centered around 320ms, Treatment A around 280ms, Treatment
    B around 250ms, and Treatment C around 290ms with visible spread variation.'
