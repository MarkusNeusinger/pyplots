review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text readability with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Clean, professional design with removed top/right spines and subtle grid
  - Value labels above bars enhance data communication
  - Realistic product sales scenario with plausible dollar amounts
  - Proper use of matplotlib Axes API (ax.bar, ax.annotate, ax.set_*)
  weaknesses:
  - Data is sorted in descending order which is less visually interesting than a mixed
    arrangement showing natural category variation
  - Could use matplotlib FuncFormatter for y-axis tick labels to show dollar signs
    consistently
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product sales
    by category. Six steel-blue bars (#306998) represent different product categories:
    Electronics ($45,200), Clothing ($32,800), Home & Garden ($28,500), Sports ($21,300),
    Books ($18,900), and Toys ($15,600). Each bar has a dollar-formatted value label
    positioned above it. The y-axis shows "Sales ($)" ranging from 0 to ~45,000, and
    the x-axis shows "Product Category". The title follows the correct format: "bar-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The plot has a clean design with subtle horizontal
    grid lines, no top/right spines, and consistent bar widths with adequate spacing.'
