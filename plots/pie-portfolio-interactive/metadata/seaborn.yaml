review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent nested donut design showing both detail (assets) and summary (categories)
    views
  - Smart use of sns.light_palette() to create cohesive color shades within categories
  - Informative annotations showing asset name, value, and percentage
  - Professional center text showing total portfolio value
  - Well-crafted legend with category summaries and holding counts
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is primarily used for theming (sns.set_theme, sns.set_context, sns.light_palette)
    rather than plotting - the actual visualization uses matplotlib ax.pie()
  - Annotations are all positioned on the right side, creating visual imbalance
  - The interactive aspect (hover, drill-down) is only described in text, not functional
    in static PNG
  image_description: 'The plot displays a nested donut chart (two concentric rings)
    representing a $1M portfolio allocation. The outer ring shows 9 individual asset
    holdings with their percentage allocations (ranging from 5% to 28%), while the
    inner ring displays 3 aggregated asset classes: Equities (50%, blue), Fixed Income
    (35%, yellow), and Alternatives (15%, teal). The center shows "Portfolio $1000K".
    Annotation boxes on the right side connect to larger holdings (≥6%) showing asset
    name, dollar value, and percentage. A legend at the bottom shows asset class summaries
    with holding counts. Colors use consistent shading within each category - various
    blues for equities, yellows for fixed income, and teals for alternatives. The
    title follows the correct format "pie-portfolio-interactive · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    An italic note at the bottom describes hover/click interactivity.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme() and sns.set_context() for styling, sns.light_palette()
          for color generation - good seaborn usage, but core visualization uses matplotlib
          ax.pie()
