review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme with Python-branded blue and yellow colors plus red baseline
  - Clear comparison between two classifiers with AP scores displayed in legend
  - Proper baseline reference line showing random classifier performance
  - Good use of pygal XY chart type for continuous data plotting
  - Clean white background with subtle grid lines enhances readability
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions violate KISS principle (no functions/classes allowed per code
    standards)
  - Legend placement in top-left corner is isolated from the plot area
  - Curves are smooth lines rather than stepped lines as recommended in spec for threshold-based
    visualization
  - Font sizes in style definition are quite large but render smaller than expected
    in final output
