review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adaptation of bar race to static small multiples format as per spec
    notes
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper use of facet_wrap
  - Consistent color palette across all time periods for tracking companies
  - Value labels well-positioned outside bars with clear formatting ($XXB)
  - Proper title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  - Realistic tech company revenue scenario with varied growth trajectories
  weaknesses:
  - Excessive vertical whitespace between top and bottom row of facets (panel_spacing=0.4
    is too large)
  - Bar ordering within facets uses reorder(company, revenue) which orders by global
    revenue, not per-facet revenue - companies are not properly sorted within each
    year panel
  - figure_size in theme is overridden by explicit width/height in save() call - redundant
    specification
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2×2 small multiples layout showing tech
    company revenue across four time periods (Year 2018, Year 2020, Year 2022, Year
    2024). Each panel contains horizontal bars representing 8 tech companies (TechCorp,
    NetSys, DataFlow, CloudBase, AppStream, ByteWorks, DigiCore, CodeLab), sorted
    by revenue within each year. Bars are color-coded consistently across all panels:
    TechCorp (Python Blue), DataFlow (Yellow), CloudBase (Steel Blue), NetSys (Mulberry),
    CodeLab (Orange), AppStream (Vermilion), ByteWorks (Dark Purple), DigiCore (Yellow-Green).
    Value labels (e.g., "$154B", "$222B") appear at the end of each bar. The title
    "Tech Company Revenue Race · bar-race-animated · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is bold
    and centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Revenue (Billions USD)" with subtle
    gridlines. Gray strip backgrounds label each year panel.'

        comment: Title is bold 24pt, strip text 20pt, axis labels 18pt, tick labels

          vertical space between top row and bottom row (panel_spacing=0.4 is too
