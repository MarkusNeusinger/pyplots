review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper time series decomposition
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with appropriate random seed
  - Good application of plotnine grammar of graphics with facet_wrap for stacked panels
  - Proper theme customization with readable font sizes and subtle grid lines
  - Realistic airline passenger scenario with 12 years of monthly data showing clear
    patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are severely overlapping/compressed in the Original and Residual
    panels, making values hard to read
  - Excessive vertical whitespace between panels due to panel_spacing_y combined with
    the facet layout
  - Unnecessary numbering prefix in component labels adds visual clutter
