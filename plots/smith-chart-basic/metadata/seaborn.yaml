review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart grid with mathematically correct constant
    R circles and constant X arcs
  - Good use of color coding to distinguish chart elements (resistance circles, reactance
    arcs, impedance locus, VSWR circle)
  - Realistic RF engineering scenario with antenna-like impedance behavior
  - VSWR 3:1 circle is a useful optional feature from the spec
  - Clean, readable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Frequency labels overlap at the 1.0 GHz and 2.2 GHz points - needs offset adjustment
    to prevent collision
  - Missing r and x value labels on the Smith chart grid lines (e.g., r=0.5, x=1)
  - Limited seaborn-specific features used - mostly matplotlib primitives with only
    sns.lineplot for the locus
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart with a unit circle boundary (blue)
    containing constant resistance circles (blue, varying sizes centered along the
    horizontal axis) and constant reactance arcs (gold/yellow, curving from the right
    side). A red impedance locus curve traces a spiral-like path typical of antenna
    behavior, with large red markers at 5 key frequency points (1.0 GHz, 2.2 GHz,
    3.6 GHz, 4.8 GHz, and 6.0 GHz) labeled in bold dark text. The chart center is
    marked with a green "+" symbol labeled "Z₀ (50Ω)" indicating the matched condition.
    A dashed purple VSWR 3:1 circle is shown with annotation. The legend in the upper
    left explains the four main elements. Axes are labeled "Real(Γ)" and "Imag(Γ)"
    with tick marks from -1.0 to 1.0. Title correctly shows "smith-chart-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai".
