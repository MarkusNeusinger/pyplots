review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent pyramid visualization with clear symmetric layout
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Well-styled text sizes appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Subtle dashed grid styling enhances readability
  - Center line at x=0 provides good visual reference
  - HTML output generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned far from the data in top right corner
  - Could add HoverTool for enhanced interactivity showing exact values
  - Center line implementation uses hardcoded y-range that may not adapt well
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid showing age distribution
    by gender. Blue bars (#306998) represent Male population extending leftward from
    the center, while coral pink bars (#E8888C) represent Female population extending
    rightward. Nine age groups (0-9 through 80+) are displayed on the y-axis labeled
    "Age Group". The x-axis shows "Population (thousands)" with a symmetric range
    from -100 to 100. A vertical center line at x=0 provides visual separation. The
    title "pyramid-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at top left. A legend in the
    top right corner identifies Male and Female. The pyramid shape clearly emerges
    with the 30-39 age group having the largest bars on both sides, tapering towards
    80+.
