review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of seaborn heatmap to render circular maze as a 2D grid
  - Algorithmically sound maze generation using Kruskal's algorithm (guarantees exactly
    one solution)
  - Clear visual markers for entry point and goal with intuitive labeling
  - High resolution figure (36x36 inches) with appropriate wall thickness
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Wall edges appear slightly pixelated due to grid-based rendering (inherent limitation
    of heatmap approach)
  - Output DPI is 100 instead of 300 (minor)
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle rendered using a seaborn
    heatmap. The maze consists of 7 concentric rings divided into 12 sectors, with
    dark gray/black walls on a light gray background. At the center is a gray circular
    goal area marked with a yellow star (★). On the right side of the outer perimeter,
    there is a clear entry opening with a blue circular marker and a "START" label
    in a white box with blue border. A legend in the bottom-left corner explains the
    Entry Point (blue circle) and Goal (Center) markers. The title "maze-circular
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold text.

        comment: Title at 36pt and START label at 24pt are clearly readable. Legend

        comment: Maze walls are clearly visible with consistent thickness. Wall definition
          could be slightly sharper.

        comment: Black walls on white background with yellow star and blue start marker
          provide excellent contrast.

        comment: Maze is well-centered with balanced margins. Legend positioned in
          bottom-left is acceptable but creates slight asymmetry.
