review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Correct ECDF implementation using step function with shape=hv
  - Clean, professional visual design with well-balanced layout
  - Proper y-axis range [0, 1] as required by spec
  - Good use of Plotly white template and subtle grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Value is generic - could use more descriptive context
  - Data scenario is generic normal distribution - could represent a real-world context
  - Could leverage Plotly interactivity features more (hover tooltips showing exact
    percentiles)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) with a clean, professional appearance. The title "ecdf-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark blue text. The x-axis is labeled "Value"
    and ranges from approximately 10 to 90, while the y-axis is labeled "Cumulative
    Proportion" and correctly ranges from 0 to 1. The ECDF is rendered as a blue step
    function line (color #306998) with appropriate thickness, showing the characteristic
    S-shaped curve of a normal distribution. The plot uses a white background with
    subtle gray grid lines. The layout is well-balanced with appropriate margins.'
