review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Renko chart algorithm with proper reversal logic (2-brick reversal requirement)
  - Clean implementation of bullish/bearish brick separation
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with scaled font sizes
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines
  weaknesses:
  - Legend label text (24pt) appears small in the final render despite being scaled
  - Could add HoverTool to show brick details on hover for better interactivity
  - No tooltips showing brick price range on hover
  image_description: The plot displays a Renko chart showing price movements using
    uniform-sized bricks. Green bricks represent bullish (upward) price movements
    while red bricks represent bearish (downward) movements. The chart starts around
    $100, rises to approximately $107, then experiences a significant downtrend to
    around $78, followed by choppy price action oscillating between $78-$90. The title
    "renko-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is positioned at the top left. The X-axis is
    labeled "Brick Number" (ranging from 0 to 50) and the Y-axis is labeled "Price
    ($)" (ranging from 75 to 105). A legend in the top left shows "Bullish" (green)
    and "Bearish" (red). The background is a light gray (#FAFAFA), and subtle dashed
    grid lines are visible. Bricks are properly separated with small gaps.
