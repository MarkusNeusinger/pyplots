review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic employee performance scenario across
    departments
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - 'Shows box plot features well: outliers, varying distributions, different spreads'
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Boxes are not visually grouped by department - appears as 9 sequential
    boxes instead of 3 groups of 3 side-by-side boxes'
  - Legend is overly verbose with 9 entries; should show only the 3 subcategory colors
    with department grouping visible from x-axis labels
  - Y-axis extends to 0 creating wasted space (data ranges ~40-110)
  - The grouped aspect of the specification is not achieved - pygal.Box() creates
    sequential boxes, not clustered groups
