review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to implementing map projections without geopandas - implements
    projection math directly
  - Excellent use of plotnine faceting (facet_wrap) for multi-panel comparison
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Clean color scheme with good visual hierarchy
  - Graticule lines add context without overwhelming the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Continent outlines are highly simplified/stylized - look more like geometric approximations
    than actual coastlines
  - Code uses multiple helper functions rather than flat KISS structure
  - Graticule lines appear segmented rather than smooth curves in Robinson/Mollweide
    projections
  - Antarctica appears unrealistically large due to the projection handling
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid comparing four cartographic projections:
    Equirectangular, Mercator, Robinson, and Mollweide. Each panel shows stylized
    continent shapes (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia,
    and Antarctica) rendered as blue polygons (#306998) with dark blue edges (#1a3a52)
    against a light blue background (#E8F4F8). Graticule lines (latitude/longitude
    grid) are visible as light steel blue (#B0C4DE) lines at 30-degree intervals.
    The title "map-projections · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in
    bold, with a subtitle explaining the comparison. Each facet panel has its projection
    name as a header in bold text on a light gray background. The Equirectangular
    panel shows equally-spaced grid lines forming rectangles. The Mercator panel demonstrates
    the characteristic polar distortion with Antarctica appearing as a massive band
    at the bottom. The Robinson and Mollweide panels show their curved graticule lines
    and more balanced global representation, though the continent shapes remain simplified
    throughout all panels.'
