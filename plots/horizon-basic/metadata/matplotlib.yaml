review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the horizon chart concept with proper band folding
    and color intensity encoding
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic server metrics scenario that perfectly matches the spec dashboard monitoring
    use case
  - Good use of matplotlib fill_between with alpha transparency for layered bands
  - Series labels positioned cleanly on the right side without cluttering the visualization
  - Legend clearly explains the 6-band color scheme
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes slightly below optimal (22pt title vs recommended 24pt, 14pt labels
    vs 16-20pt)
  - Series could show more dramatic variation to better demonstrate the horizon chart
    ability to highlight differences
  - Missing descriptive subtitle explaining what horizon charts do
