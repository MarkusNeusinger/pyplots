review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic wind patterns (prevailing SW/W directions
    using mixture distributions)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and legend configuration
  - Good use of custom Style for colors and font sizes
  - Appropriate choice of square canvas for polar chart
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Stacked layers not visible - only the outermost red (>12 m/s) layer
    shows; the cumulative stacking approach causes all layers to overlap completely,
    hiding the inner speed categories'
  - Wind rose should show distinct stacked segments for each speed category, but current
    implementation renders them as overlapping filled polygons where only the top
    layer is visible
  - Direction labels (N, NE, etc.) could be larger for better readability
