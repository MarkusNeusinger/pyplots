review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features (colorbar, Viridis, hexagonal
    binning)
  - Strong realistic data context with ride-share pickup scenario and three distinct
    clusters
  - All text sizes explicitly set for consistent legibility
  - 'Good visual refinement: removed grids/zeroline, subtle background, white hex
    borders'
  - Clean use of Plotly-specific features (hexagon2, hovertemplate, scaleanchor, HTML
    export)
  - Three clusters create natural visual hierarchy and focal points
  weaknesses:
  - Small white gaps visible between hexagons disrupt seamless tiled appearance
  - Design is polished but not publication-ready — needs more intentional typography
    or annotations
  - Heavy reliance on manual hex binning means most code is numpy not Plotly-native
  - Marker size calculation is complex and tightly coupled to figure dimensions
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization of ride-share
    pickup density across a metro area. Hexagons are colored using the Viridis colorscale,
    ranging from dark purple (0 pickups) to bright yellow (~250 pickups). Three distinct
    density clusters are visible: a high-density hotspot in the center-upper area
    (around coordinates 1, 3.5) shown in yellow/green, a moderate cluster on the left
    (around -4, 1) in green/teal, and a moderate cluster on the right (around 6, 1.5)
    in teal. The title "hexbin-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    X-axis is labeled "Distance East (km)" and Y-axis "Distance North (km)". A vertical
    colorbar on the right is titled "Pickups" with a range of 0-250. The background
    is light gray, grid lines are hidden, and hexagons have thin white borders separating
    them. The overall layout is clean with the plotly_white template.'
