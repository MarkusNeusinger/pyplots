review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart label hiding for narrow rectangles using transform_calculate
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: mark_rect, tooltips, layered charts with
    text overlay'
  - Realistic file system data with meaningful folder structure and plausible file
    sizes
  - Clean color progression by hierarchy level with good colorblind accessibility
  - Proper canvas utilization with 1600x900 dimensions scaled to target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (calc_value, calc_level, calc_positions) instead of flat
    KISS structure preferred by the style guide
  - Title uses regular periods instead of middle dot character (·)
  - Some level 3 rectangles are very narrow making the hierarchy less visible for
    small files
  - Color contrast between adjacent levels could be stronger for better visual distinction
