review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of funnel concept using centered rectangles with
    proportional widths
  - Clear labeling with stage names, absolute values, and percentages on each segment
  - Pleasing blue gradient color scheme that progresses naturally from dark to light
  - Clean removal of axes, grid, and legend for a polished funnel appearance
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - The sys.path manipulation workaround for import conflicts is not ideal (though
    necessary given file naming constraints)
  - Uses rectangular bars rather than true trapezoids, so it is technically a bar
    funnel rather than a classic funnel shape
  image_description: 'The plot displays a funnel chart with 5 horizontal rectangular
    bars stacked vertically, representing a sales funnel. The bars progressively narrow
    from top to bottom: "Awareness" (widest, dark blue #306998, showing 1,000/100%),
    "Interest" (medium blue, 600/60%), "Consideration" (lighter blue, 400/40%), "Intent"
    (even lighter, 200/20%), and "Purchase" (lightest blue, smallest bar, 100/10%).
    Each bar has white text centered showing the stage name, value with comma formatting,
    and percentage. The title "funnel-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold black text. The background is white with no axes, grid, or legend
    visible. The chart uses a blue gradient color scheme progressing from darker to
    lighter shades.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (geom_rect, aes, theme_minimal), but funnel is
