review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using plotnine cartesian coordinates with
    manual polar transformation
  - Clean use of Python blue and yellow colors for colorblind accessibility
  - Proper polygon closure by repeating the first point
  - Well-implemented circular gridlines and radial spokes for reference
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.25) allowing overlap visibility as specified
  - Category labels positioned clearly outside the chart
  - Realistic employee performance review scenario with 6 meaningful competency categories
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels could be slightly larger (14pt to 16-18pt) for better readability
    at full resolution
  - No value labels on gridlines (e.g., 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) to help readers gauge
    values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/spider chart comparing two employees
    (Alice and Bob) across six performance dimensions: Creativity, Leadership, Communication,
    Technical, Problem Solving, and Teamwork. The chart features a white background
    with dashed circular gridlines at regular intervals. Alice''s data is shown in
    Python blue (#306998) and Bob''s in Python yellow (#FFD43B). Both polygons are
    filled with transparency (~0.25 alpha), allowing overlapping areas to be visible.
    Each vertex is marked with a colored point, and the category labels are positioned
    around the outer edge of the chart. The legend is positioned to the right showing
    "Employee" with Alice (blue) and Bob (yellow). The title "radar-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.'

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot, aes, geom_polygon, geom_line,
          geom_point, geom_text, theme), but radar charts are not a native strength
          of plotnine - required manual coordinate transformation
  verdict: APPROVED
