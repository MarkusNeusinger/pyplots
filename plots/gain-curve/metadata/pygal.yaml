review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of cumulative gains chart with model curve and random baseline
  - Excellent color contrast (blue vs gray) for colorblind accessibility
  - Good custom styling with appropriate font sizes for large canvas (4800×2700)
  - Clean KISS code structure following linear flow pattern
  - Proper axis labels with percentage units
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate data sampling (every 2%) for smooth pygal rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner is outside the main plot area and appears
    isolated
  - Could add a Perfect Model reference line (vertical to 100% at positive rate, then
    horizontal) as mentioned in spec notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative gains chart on a white background
    at 4800×2700 pixels. The title "gain-curve · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top center in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled "Population Targeted (%)"
    ranging from 0 to 100, and the Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Gains (%)" also ranging
    from 0 to 100. Two lines are plotted: a blue "Model Gains" curve that shows the
    cumulative gains achieved by the model (starting steep then flattening), and a
    gray "Random Baseline" diagonal line representing random selection. The legend
    appears in the top-left corner showing "Model Gains" (blue) and "Random Baseline"
    (gray). Grid lines are visible with subtle gray coloring. The model curve clearly
    shows better-than-random performance as it consistently stays above the diagonal
    baseline.'
