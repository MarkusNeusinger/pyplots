review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation matching spec recommendation for readability
  - Clear reference line at null hypothesis with annotation
  - Well-sized markers (18) and error bars with visible caps (width=10)
  - Proper use of asymmetric error bars calculated from CI bounds
  - Clean clinical trial context that is realistic and neutral
  - Good font sizing hierarchy (title 32, labels 24, ticks 18-20)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in bottom-right could overlap with data; top-right or outside
    placement preferred
  - All treatment effects are positive; including one negative effect would better
    demonstrate full capability
  - Grid opacity at 0.1 is very subtle; 0.2-0.3 would improve readability
