review:
  strengths:
  - Clear community clustering with three distinct visual groups (Engineering blue,
    Marketing yellow, Sales coral)
  - Hub labels effectively highlight high-degree nodes without cluttering the visualization
  - Node sizes scale appropriately by connection count, making network structure immediately
    apparent
  - Proper force-directed layout algorithm implementation with visible inter-community
    bridge connections
  - Clean colorblind-accessible palette using distinct hues (blue, yellow, coral)
  weaknesses:
  - Some Hub labels overlap with nodes or other Hub labels in dense areas, reducing
    readability
  - The plot could utilize slightly more canvas area - there is unused whitespace
    on the left and right edges
  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph with 50 nodes
    organized into three distinct communities. The title "network-force-directed ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Three communities are visible: **Engineering**
    (dark blue nodes, right side), **Marketing** (yellow nodes, bottom-center), and
    **Sales** (coral/salmon red nodes, top-center). Nodes vary in size based on their
    connection count, with larger nodes indicating more connections. Gray edges connect
    related nodes, with dense intra-community connections and sparse inter-community
    bridges visible. "Hub" labels mark high-degree nodes throughout the graph. A legend
    titled "Teams" appears in the upper-left corner with a white background. The layout
    uses a clean white background with no axes or gridlines, appropriate for network
    visualization.'
