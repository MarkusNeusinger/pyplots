review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent calendar layout with weeks as columns and weekdays as rows
  - Realistic GitHub-style contribution data with weekday/weekend patterns
  - Clean green sequential colormap that is accessible and intuitive
  - Well-proportioned layout with proper cell spacing using white borders
  - All text is clearly readable at the target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Could use seaborn figure-level functions or additional styling features to better
    showcase the library
  image_description: The plot displays a calendar heatmap showing daily contributions
    over the year 2024. The visualization uses a green sequential colormap ("Greens")
    with white cell borders. Weekdays (Mon-Sun) are labeled on the y-axis, and months
    (Jan-Dec) are labeled on the x-axis. Each cell represents a day, with color intensity
    indicating the contribution count (0-15). The colorbar on the right shows "Daily
    Contributions" ranging from 0 to approximately 15. The title "heatmap-calendar
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The plot shows a clear pattern
    with higher activity (darker green) on weekdays and lower activity (lighter green)
    on weekends (Sat/Sun rows are noticeably lighter). The layout fills the canvas
    well with good proportions.
