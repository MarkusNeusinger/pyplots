review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper bar sizing and spacing between tasks
  - Smart use of geom_segment with square end markers for clean Gantt bar appearance
  - Professional color palette with 6 distinct phase colors
  - Well-structured realistic software development project data
  - Proper canvas sizing (1600x900 with scale=3) for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean week-based x-axis labeling making timeline easy to follow
  - Tasks logically sorted by start date for natural reading flow
  weaknesses:
  - Missing today marker (vertical reference line) which spec notes suggest
  - Blue and teal colors for Planning and Deployment phases could be more distinct
    for colorblind accessibility
  - Cleanup code for lets-plot-images folder adds unnecessary complexity
