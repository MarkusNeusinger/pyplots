review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.heatmap with custom colormap to create waffle chart effect
  - Perfect grid structure with clean white separators (linewidths=2)
  - Good color palette starting with Python Blue (#306998)
  - Correct square aspect ratio for waffle charts
  - Legend clearly shows categories with percentages
  - Realistic budget allocation example that demonstrates the chart type well
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the grid (large gap between chart and legend)
  - Grid fills top-to-bottom which is less intuitive than bottom-to-top (like filling
    a glass)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10x10 waffle chart (100 squares) representing
    budget allocation across 5 categories. The grid fills from the top-left corner,
    moving left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Colors used: Blue (#306998) for Housing
    (35 squares), Yellow (#FFD43B) for Food (25 squares), Green (#4CAF50) for Transportation
    (20 squares), Orange (#FF7043) for Utilities (12 squares), and Purple (#9C27B0)
    for Entertainment (8 squares). The title "waffle-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. A legend below the chart shows all categories with
    their percentages. White grid lines separate each square. The plot uses a square
    aspect ratio (12x12 inches) which is appropriate for waffle charts.'
