review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing diverse distributions (tight, wide, bimodal, outliers)
    that effectively demonstrates swarm plot capabilities
  - Clean implementation of median markers with proper legend explanation
  - Proper use of hue parameter with legend=False to avoid seaborn 0.14+ deprecation
    warnings
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  - Appropriate point size and alpha for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Performance Score (points)" or "Performance
    Score (0-100)")
  - Could leverage more seaborn features like sns.set_theme() for consistent styling
