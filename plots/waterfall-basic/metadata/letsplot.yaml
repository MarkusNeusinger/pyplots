review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent waterfall chart structure with proper floating bars and connector lines
  - Clear color coding distinguishes increases (green), decreases (red), and totals
    (blue)
  - Value labels are well-positioned and formatted (totals show full amount, changes
    show +/- prefix)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of geom_rect for precise bar positioning
  - Good financial scenario demonstrating all waterfall features
  weaknesses:
  - No gridlines present - subtle horizontal gridlines would help readers estimate
    values between labeled ticks
  - Could use more distinct colorblind-safe palette (e.g., blue/orange instead of
    green/red)
  image_description: 'The waterfall chart displays a quarterly financial breakdown
    from Starting Balance to Net Profit. The chart uses:

    - **Blue bars** (#306998) for totals (Starting Balance at $50,000 and Net Profit
    at $61,000)

    - **Green bars** (#22C55E) for increases (Product Sales +$35,000, Service Revenue
    +$18,000)

    - **Red bars** (#EF4444) for decreases (Operating Costs -$22,000, Marketing -$8,000,
    Taxes -$12,000)

    - **White value labels** centered on each bar with proper formatting (totals show
    $XX,XXX, changes show +/-XX,XXX)

    - **Dashed connector lines** between bars showing cumulative flow

    - **Title** at top: "waterfall-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"

    - **Y-axis** labeled "Amount ($)" with dollar formatting from $0 to $100,000

    - **X-axis** labels rotated 30 degrees for readability

    - **Legend** on right showing Change Type (Increase, Decrease, Total)'
