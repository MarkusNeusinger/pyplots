review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native bullet chart module with proper targetOptions
    configuration
  - Grayscale qualitative ranges follow spec recommendation for keeping focus on primary
    measure
  - Data labels display original values with units inside bars for precise reading
  - Multiple bullet charts stacked vertically for easy metric comparison
  - Good normalization approach allows comparing different-scale metrics on common
    0-100% axis
  - Clean separation of data definition and chart options
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend scoring limited since bullet charts do not typically use these elements
  - Vertical spacing between metrics could be tighter for more compact dashboard view
  - Y-axis title slightly small relative to 4800x2700 canvas
