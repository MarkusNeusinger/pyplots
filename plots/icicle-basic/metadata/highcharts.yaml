review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between directory categories
  - Realistic file system data with plausible file sizes and meaningful hierarchy
  - Good use of Highcharts treemap with sliceAndDice layout algorithm
  - Level-based styling with decreasing font sizes for deeper levels
  - Custom tooltips showing file sizes in KB
  - Legend provides clear category identification
  - Interactive standalone HTML version for exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Layout does not match true icicle chart structure (spec says root at top/left
    with children below/right in stacked rows/columns, but current layout has nested
    rectangles more like a treemap)
  - Root node Project Files appears in center-left rather than at top spanning full
    width
  - Some file labels are small and harder to read (e.g., validators.ts, icons.svg)
