review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and proper font hierarchy
  - Complete spec compliance with all required features (error bars, color gradient,
    reference line, sorted bars)
  - Realistic customer churn prediction scenario with sensible feature names
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotnine grammar of graphics idioms
  - Good color palette choice (yellow-blue) that is colorblind accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use Score Decrease or similar context)
  - Library features score is modest - could leverage more plotnine-specific features
  - Horizontal grid lines (panel_grid_major_y) show through bars which adds visual
    noise for a horizontal bar chart
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing permutation
    feature importance for a customer churn prediction model. The title "bar-permutation-importance
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. Features are listed on the
    y-axis (Contract Length at top down to Multiple Lines at bottom), sorted by importance.
    The x-axis shows "Mean Decrease in Model Score" ranging from 0.00 to approximately
    0.15. Bars are colored with a sequential gradient from yellow (low importance)
    to blue (high importance). Each bar has horizontal error bars showing variability.
    A vertical dashed gray reference line at x=0 distinguishes positive from negative
    importance values. The legend on the right shows the "Importance" color scale.
    The layout is clean with a minimal theme, subtle grid lines, and well-spaced elements.
