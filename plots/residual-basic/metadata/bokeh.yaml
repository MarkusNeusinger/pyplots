review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with custom
    formatting, and Span for reference line'
  - Proper scaling for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriately sized text (72pt title,
    48pt labels, 36pt ticks) and markers (size=40)
  - Realistic housing price regression scenario with meaningful outliers and subtle
    heteroscedasticity
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - The LOWESS/LOESS trend line mentioned in the spec notes as "consider adding" is
    not implemented (optional but would enhance diagnostic capability)
  - Feature coverage could show more pronounced heteroscedasticity pattern for better
    demonstration of this diagnostic feature
