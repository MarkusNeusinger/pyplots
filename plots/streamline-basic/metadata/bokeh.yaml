review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of streamline tracing using Euler integration with proper
    handling of bounds and speed thresholds
  - Beautiful color gradient from teal to yellow representing velocity magnitude -
    visually appealing and informative
  - Arrowheads at streamline ends clearly indicate flow direction
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled text elements
  - Clean, well-structured code that is easy to understand
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use "X Position (arbitrary units)" or similar)
  - Could demonstrate more varied flow patterns to showcase streamline capabilities
    beyond simple vortex
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's ColumnDataSource for data organization
  - No interactive features (hover tooltips showing velocity magnitude would enhance
    the Bokeh implementation)
