review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of Premier League standings as realistic bump chart scenario
  - Proper Y-axis inversion (rank 1 at top) as specified
  - Good use of layered charts combining lines and points for clarity
  - Python Blue (#306998) used as primary color per pyplots convention
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips exported alongside PNG
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (O, Q, N)
  weaknesses:
  - Brown and light gray colors for Man United and Tottenham could be more distinguishable
    for accessibility
  - Missing explicit reproducibility comment (data is deterministic but not annotated)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing Premier League team standings
    over 6 match weeks. The title "bump-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in large black text. The Y-axis shows "League Position" from 1 (top) to 6
    (bottom), correctly inverted. The X-axis shows "Match Week" with Week 1-6 labels
    rotated at approximately 45 degrees. Six teams are represented with distinct colors:
    Arsenal (blue), Chelsea (yellow), Liverpool (red/coral), Man City (green), Man
    United (brown), and Tottenham (light gray). Each team''s trajectory is shown with
    connected lines (stroke width ~4) and filled circular markers at each week. The
    legend is positioned on the right side. A subtle dashed grid helps track positions.
    The layout is clean with good proportions.'

          features like selections
  verdict: APPROVED
