review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between adjacent layers
  - Smooth cubic interpolation creates flowing curves as specified
  - Realistic music streaming data with seasonal variation and trends
  - Good use of pygal styling with custom font sizes for large canvas
  - Legend properly identifies all 5 genre categories
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Not a true streamgraph - baseline starts at y≈40, not centered around
    y=0. The specification requires symmetric baseline centered around the x-axis
    creating an organic river-like appearance - the invisible baseline layer technique
    does not achieve the symmetric/centered visual effect'
  - Title format incorrect - includes Music Streaming Trends prefix instead of just
