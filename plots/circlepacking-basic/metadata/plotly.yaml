review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of file system storage hierarchy as a realistic, relatable data
    scenario
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme using blue and yellow tones
  - Clean circle packing implementation with proper size proportionality
  - Effective use of Plotly shape and annotation features for custom visualization
  - Interactive hover functionality adds value to the HTML output
  - Labels clearly show category names and sizes in MB
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra prefix before the required format
  - Leaf-level nodes (individual files) are not visible in the rendered output
  - Helper functions violate the KISS principle (should be flat script structure)
  - Some minor text overlap between subcategory and category labels
