review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sorting implementation with proper reversal for pygal bottom-to-top
    rendering
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent theming at high resolution
  - Value labels centered in bars with proper currency formatting
  - Horizontal orientation is ideal for category labels as noted in spec
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Missing y-axis title to label the categories dimension
  - Data values could show more variation to better demonstrate sorting benefit
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing monthly sales
    by product category, sorted in descending order from top to bottom. The title
    "bar-sorted · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Eight categories are shown:
    Electronics ($4,850) at the top, followed by Clothing ($3,720), Home & Garden
    ($2,980), Sports ($2,450), Books ($1,890), Toys ($1,560), Beauty ($1,240), and
    Food ($980) at the bottom. All bars are rendered in Python Blue (#306998). The
    x-axis is labeled "Sales (USD)" with tick marks at $0, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000,
    and $4,000. Value labels are displayed centered within each bar with dollar formatting.
    Subtle vertical grid lines help with value reading. The layout is clean with good
    use of whitespace.'

        comment: Uses HorizontalBar, custom Style, print_values with value_formatter,
          truncate_label. Good use of pygal-specific features but could leverage more
          interactive SVG capabilities.
