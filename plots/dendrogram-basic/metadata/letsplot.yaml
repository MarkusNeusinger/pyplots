review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of dendrogram from scratch using geom_segment - creative
    solution since lets-plot does not have built-in dendrogram support
  - Clear hierarchical structure with proper Ward distance calculations using scipy
  - Good color threshold system distinguishing major clusters (blue) from subclusters
    (yellow)
  - Appropriate text sizing and angled labels prevent overlap
  - Realistic iris flower dataset demonstrates meaningful clustering results
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis extends into negative territory (to -2) when all distance values are non-negative;
    should start at 0 or slightly below label positions
  - X-axis label Sample is generic; could be more descriptive like Iris Samples or
    simply removed since individual labels are shown
