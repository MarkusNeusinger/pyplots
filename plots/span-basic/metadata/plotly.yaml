  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical and horizontal spans with realistic economic
    data
  - Uses plotly native add_hrect() and add_vrect() methods which are the idiomatic
    way to create spans
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Both span regions have clear text annotations explaining their purpose
  - Semi-transparent fills (0.25 opacity) allow underlying data and overlapping regions
    to remain visible
  - Realistic recession period scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g. Economic Index base=100 would be more informative)
  - HTML output could leverage plotly interactive features (hover info on spans, range
    slider) but these are optional enhancements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart with an Economic Index (y-axis,
    range ~85-120) plotted against Year (x-axis, 2005-2014). The data is shown as
    a blue line with circular markers (#306998 color). Two span regions are clearly
    visible:

    1. A **vertical span** (light blue, semi-transparent) marking the "Recession"
    period from approximately 2007.5 to 2009.5, with a text label in the top-left
    corner

    2. A **horizontal span** (light yellow, semi-transparent) marking the "Target
    Zone" between values 105-115, also labeled in the top-left corner


    The title "span-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The legend
    shows "Economic Index" in the bottom-left corner with a white background. The
    plot uses the plotly_white template with subtle gray gridlines. The overlapping
    region of both spans creates a greenish tint where they intersect.'

        comment: Uses plotly's add_hrect and add_vrect which are convenient but basic.
          Could have leveraged hover interactivity, animation, or range slider for
          the HTML output.
