  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required features (median, outliers, whiskers,
    per-category colors) implemented correctly
  - Strong data quality with realistic business scenario and varied distributions
    showing different means and spreads
  - All font sizes explicitly set for high-resolution rendering, ensuring clear legibility
    at 4800x2700
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good color variety across five departments
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations highlighting key insights (e.g., Design
    has highest median, Finance has widest spread, or mark specific outlier values)'
  - 'Visual refinement could be improved: consider removing axis spines, adjusting
    box spacing to better fill horizontal space'
  - The string replacement approach for injecting stemColor and fillColor is fragile
    — if the Highcharts API output format changes, these replacements will silently
    fail
  - Subtitle provides context but could be complemented with visual emphasis (e.g.,
    highlighting the department with best scores)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one for each department (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Design, Finance). Each
    box has a distinct semi-transparent fill color: Engineering in steel blue (#306998),
    Marketing in golden yellow (#FFD43B), Sales in muted purple (#9467BD), Design
    in cyan (#17BECF), and Finance in brown (#8C564B). The boxes show 75% opacity
    fills with dark outlines. Median lines are drawn in near-black (#1a1a1a) with
    prominent width. Whiskers extend as solid dark gray lines with 50% whisker caps.
    Outliers appear as red-orange circles (radius 10) — visible near Engineering (~57),
    above Marketing (~100), and above Sales (~100). The title "box-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at top in large bold text (64px), with a subtitle "Annual
    Performance Review Scores by Department" in gray (42px). The Y-axis is labeled
    "Score (out of 100)" with tick marks every 5 units from ~35 to 105. The X-axis
    shows department names with "Department" as the axis title. Background is white
    with very subtle horizontal gridlines (6% opacity). The overall layout is clean
    with good vertical space usage, though the horizontal distribution of boxes leaves
    some empty space on the right.'
