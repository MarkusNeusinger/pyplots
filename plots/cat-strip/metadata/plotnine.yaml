review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with clear title, axis labels, and tick marks all easily
    readable
  - Good use of geom_jitter with appropriate width parameter to show individual points
    without excessive overlap
  - Clean KISS code structure following the template exactly
  - Realistic product performance scenario with varied distributions showing different
    spreads and means
  - Proper use of theme_minimal() for a clean, professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme alternates blue/yellow by category but this does not convey meaningful
    information - could use a single color or gradient
  - Axis label Performance Score lacks units (e.g., Performance Score (%) or similar)
  - Some performance scores exceed 100 which may seem unrealistic for a typical percentage-based
    score
  image_description: The plot displays a categorical strip plot with four product
    categories (Product A, B, C, D) on the x-axis and Performance Score (ranging from
    ~45 to ~115) on the y-axis. Points are jittered horizontally to reduce overlap.
    Colors alternate between blue (#306998) for Products A and C, and yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Products B and D. The title "cat-strip · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is at the
    top. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines. Each category
    shows approximately 30 data points with different distributions - Product A has
    a tight cluster around 70-80, Product B shows more spread with higher values,
    Product C has a tight cluster around 65-75, and Product D shows the widest spread
    from ~45 to ~115.

        comment: Uses geom_jitter which is standard ggplot grammar, but doesn't leverage
          plotnine-specific features like faceting, statistical transformations, or
          more sophisticated scales
  verdict: APPROVED
