review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with the plasma colormap providing smooth, perceptually
    uniform color transitions
  - Well-designed mathematical surface showing multiple features (peaks, valley, ridge)
    that demonstrate contour capabilities
  - Properly sized text elements following library guidelines (24/20/16pt for title/labels/ticks)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data generation section
  - Overlaid white contour lines at matching 15 bins provide precise level identification
    as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) rather than having a concrete
    real-world context with units
  - Data context is mathematical rather than a real-world application scenario (e.g.,
    topographic elevation, temperature distribution)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization of a 2D scalar
    field with the plasma colormap from viridis. Two prominent peaks appear as bright
    yellow/orange concentric regions: a main peak at approximately (1.5, 1.5) and
    a secondary peak at (-1.5, -1.5). A subtle depression is visible at (1.5, -1.5)
    appearing as a slightly darker blue-purple region. A diagonal ridge connects features
    across the plot. The colors range from deep purple/blue (values near 0) through
    pink/magenta to bright yellow (values near 1). White contour lines are overlaid
    at 15 levels to help identify precise boundaries. The title "contour-filled ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, axis labels show "X Coordinate" and
    "Y Coordinate", and a vertical colorbar labeled "Value" displays the mapping from
    0 to 1.'
