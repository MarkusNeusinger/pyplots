review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine style=left-right parameter for true split violins
  - Inner boxplots add valuable statistical detail (quartiles and outliers visible)
  - Clear color contrast between blue and yellow for accessibility
  - Realistic employee training scenario with meaningful before/after comparison
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for all text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entry order (After Training first) does not match intuitive temporal order
    (Before should come first)
  - Boxplots are slightly narrow and could be more prominent
  - Distribution shapes are somewhat similar across departments - more varied shapes
    would better demonstrate the plot type capabilities
