review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of inverse normal CDF without scipy dependency (self-contained)
  - Clear visual demonstration of right skewness with data deviating above reference
    line
  - Proper scaling of theoretical quantiles to match sample mean and standard deviation
  - Good use of Altair layering to combine reference line and scatter points
  - Interactive tooltips enhance exploration of individual data points
  - Appropriate styling with Python blue color scheme and dashed yellow reference
    line
  weaknesses:
  - Point size (200) slightly large for 100 points; 150-180 would reduce overlap in
    dense regions
  - Axis labels could include context hint (e.g., Sample Quantiles (sorted values))
  - The manual inverse CDF implementation, while impressive, adds code complexity
  image_description: The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot with blue filled
    circular points (#306998, Python blue) against a light gray background. A yellow
    dashed diagonal reference line (y=x) runs from the lower left to upper right.
    The X-axis is labeled "Theoretical Quantiles" and Y-axis "Sample Quantiles", both
    ranging approximately from 10-90. The title "qq-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in a clear, readable font. Points generally follow the reference line
    through the center but deviate above it in the upper right region, clearly demonstrating
    the intended slight right skew in the data. The grid uses subtle dashed lines
    with low opacity. Point sizes are appropriate for the 100 data points.

        comment: Saves plot.png and plot.html correctly, but the manual inverse CDF
          implementation is overly complex when scipy.stats.norm.ppf would suffice
          (though this avoids scipy dependency)

        comment: Uses Altair's layering (reference_line + points), tooltips for interactivity,
          configure_axis/configure_view for styling. Could use more Altair-specific
          features like selections or conditional encoding.
  verdict: APPROVED
