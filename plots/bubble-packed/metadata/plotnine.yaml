review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of circle packing algorithm with force simulation for
    tight packing
  - Area-based scaling (sqrt) correctly used for accurate visual perception per spec
  - Colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette provides excellent accessibility
  - Smart label handling with full/truncated/abbreviated text based on circle size
  - Clean code structure with well-organized packing algorithm inline
  weaknesses:
  - Label truncation cuts off Engineering to Engineerin and Customer Service to Customer
    S which loses readability
  - No distinctive plotnine grammar of graphics features used - relies heavily on
    manual polygon construction
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart with 15 circles representing
    department budgets. Circles vary in size based on budget value, with Engineering
    (largest, blue) and R&D (blue) being most prominent, followed by Marketing (yellow/gold),
    Sales (yellow), and Operations (green). The circles are color-coded by four department
    groups: Tech (blue #0072B2), Business (yellow/gold #E69F00), Operations (green
    #009E73), and Support (purple/pink #CC79A7). Labels are displayed inside circles
    with white bold text - larger circles show full or truncated labels ("Engineerin",
    "Customer S"), while smallest circles show abbreviated labels. The circles are
    tightly packed without overlap. Title "bubble-packed · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top center in bold black text. A legend on the right identifies the
    four department groups.'

        comment: Title is 24pt bold, legend text clear. Some labels truncated but

        comment: Uses geom_polygon for circles which is a workaround since plotnine
          doesn't have native circle/bubble packing. This is creative but not a distinctive
          plotnine feature.
  verdict: APPROVED
