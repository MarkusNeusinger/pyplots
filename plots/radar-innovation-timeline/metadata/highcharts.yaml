review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 270° radial layout with all spec features implemented (concentric rings,
    sector divisions, background fills, smart label placement)
  - Strong visual hierarchy through marker size variation by ring and semantic ring
    label colors (green-to-red adoption progression)
  - Realistic technology radar data with 29 plausible items across 4 sectors and 4
    rings
  - Creative use of Highcharts renderer API for custom SVG ring/sector overlays
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format, legend, and all required features
  weaknesses:
  - Some label crowding in the inner Adopt ring where multiple items cluster together
    (ML Feature Stores/LLM Code Review/Platform Engineering)
  - Duplicate ring labels at two angles (48° and 313°) add slight visual clutter
  - Does not use the Python highcharts-core API, constructing raw JS config instead
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Technology Innovation Radar on a square
    canvas with an off-white (#fafafa) background. It uses a 270° radial layout with
    4 concentric rings representing adoption stages: Adopt (innermost, largest markers),
    Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost, smallest markers). The rings have subtle blue
    gradient fills that decrease in opacity from inner to outer. Four angular sectors
    divide the space: AI & ML (top, blue #306998), Cloud & DevOps (left, orange #D4762C),
    Security (bottom-left, green #3C9150), and Data Engineering (bottom-right, purple
    #8C50A0). Each sector header is displayed in bold colored text along the outer
    edge. Ring labels appear in italic with semantic colors (green for Adopt, golden
    for Trial, orange for Assess, dark red for Hold) at two positions along the right
    side. 29 technology items are plotted as colored circles with white borders, with
    marker sizes decreasing from inner to outer rings. Each point has a text label
    positioned with alternating above/below offsets to reduce overlap. Dashed concentric
    circles mark ring boundaries, and straight lines from the center divide sectors.
    A vertical legend on the right shows the four sector categories. The title reads
    "radar-innovation-timeline · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Technology
    Innovation Radar — Items mapped by adoption stage and domain."'
