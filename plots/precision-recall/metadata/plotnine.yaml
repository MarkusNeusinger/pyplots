review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (Python blue for curve, yellow
    for baseline)
  - Proper use of stepped line style (geom_step with direction=vh) accurately representing
    threshold-based curve
  - Clean annotation box with white background improves readability of AP score
  - Comprehensive axis labels with clarifying terms in parentheses
  - Proper implementation of precision-recall calculation from scratch
  - Good use of imbalanced dataset (80/20 split) demonstrating real-world applicability
  weaknesses:
  - Missing iso-F1 contour curves mentioned in specification (optional but would enhance
    the visualization)
  - Annotation text positioning could conflict with curve at different data distributions
  - No formal legend element; relies solely on inline annotations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Precision-Recall curve on a white background
    with a subtle gray grid. The main curve is rendered in Python blue (#306998) using
    a stepped line style, starting at (0, 1.0) and descending as recall increases
    towards 1.0. A yellow dashed horizontal baseline is shown at y=0.21 representing
    the random classifier performance. Two text annotations are present: "Average
    Precision (AP) = 0.901" in bold blue text on a white semi-transparent rectangle
    in the upper-right area, and "Random Classifier (baseline = 0.21)" in yellow text
    just above the baseline. The title "precision-recall · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. X-axis is labeled "Recall (Sensitivity)" and Y-axis is
    labeled "Precision (Positive Predictive Value)". Both axes range from 0.0 to 1.0
    with tick marks at 0.2 intervals.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_step, geom_hline, annotate,
          theme customization; could leverage more plotnine-specific features like
          scale_color_manual or faceting
