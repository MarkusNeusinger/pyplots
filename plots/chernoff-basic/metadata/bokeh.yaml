review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual differentiation between sectors through color and facial expression
    patterns
  - Excellent business context with realistic company performance metrics
  - Proper normalization of data as spec requires
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool for interactivity'
  - Feature mapping subtitle explains what each facial feature represents
  - Well-organized 4x3 grid layout makes comparison easy
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned too far from the faces (at very top of plot)
  - Faces could be slightly larger to better utilize the canvas space
