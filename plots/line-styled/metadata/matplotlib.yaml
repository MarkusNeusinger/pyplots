review:
  strengths:
  - All four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot) are clearly visible
    and easily distinguishable
  - Added markers provide additional visual differentiation beyond line styles alone
  - Consistent line width across all series maintains visual harmony
  - Legend clearly maps styles to series names as required by the specification
  - The plot is well-suited for black-and-white printing - the different line styles
    would remain distinguishable without color
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., Performance Score (pts) or Relative Performance)
  - 'Blue color palette has two similar shades (#306998 and #4B8BBE) - while line
    styles make them distinguishable, more contrasting colors would improve color
    accessibility further'
