review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent elbow curve visualization with clear elbow point identification at k=4
  - Professional annotation with arrow pointing to the optimal cluster count
  - Thoughtful diminishing returns shaded region adds educational value
  - 'Color scheme (Python blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B) is visually appealing and
    brand-consistent'
  - Realistic inertia decay pattern that demonstrates the typical K-means behavior
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is defined but not displayed (ax.legend() call is missing), though the
    label parameter and axvspan label are set
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarify unitless nature of inertia
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-Means clustering on a
    16:9 landscape canvas with a white background. The X-axis shows "Number of Clusters
    (k)" ranging from 1 to 10, and the Y-axis shows "Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of
    Squares)" ranging from approximately 500 to 5000. A dark blue line (#306998) connects
    10 data points, each marked with yellow (#FFD43B) circular markers with blue borders.
    The curve shows the characteristic elbow shape with a sharp decline from k=1 to
    k=4, then a gradual decrease from k=4 onwards. The elbow point at k=4 is highlighted
    with a larger yellow marker and annotated with "Elbow Point (k=4)" in bold blue
    text with an arrow pointing to it. A subtle light blue shaded region spans from
    k=4 to k=10 indicating the "diminishing returns" zone. The title "elbow-curve
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A subtle dashed grid is visible
    in the background.

        comment: Shows elbow curve shape well with clear elbow point; slight deduction

        comment: Good use of annotations with arrowprops, axvspan for shading, marker
          customization. Could use more distinctive features like spines customization
          or secondary annotations.
  verdict: APPROVED
