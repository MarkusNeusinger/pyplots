review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of ridgeline plot using XY polygons in a library without
    native KDE support
  - Beautiful seasonal color gradient transitioning from blue (winter) to yellow (summer)
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with monthly temperature distributions
  - Proper overlap (60-70%) creates cohesive ridge appearance
  - Good canvas sizing at 4800x2700 with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Clean KISS code structure with inline KDE calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis displays numeric values (0-24) instead of month labels as required by specification
  - Bottom legend is redundant when Y-axis should already show month labels
  - Adjacent blue shades (Dec/Jan/Feb and Mar/Nov) are somewhat difficult to distinguish
