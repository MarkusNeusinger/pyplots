review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent candlestick construction using layered approach (wicks as mark_rule,
    bodies as mark_bar)
  - Clean declarative encoding with proper type annotations (:T for temporal, :Q for
    quantitative, :N for nominal)
  - Comprehensive tooltips showing all OHLC values with proper formatting
  - Good data generation showing realistic price movements with varying volatility
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Legend for Bullish/Bearish direction is not visible in the rendered output despite
    being configured in code
  - Color scheme uses red-green which is not ideal for colorblind accessibility
  - Missing interactive() method which is Altair signature feature for web-based exploration
