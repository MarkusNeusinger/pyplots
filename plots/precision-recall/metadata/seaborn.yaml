review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized fonts and stepped line visualization
  - Well-implemented comparison of two classifiers with different performance levels
  - Baseline reference line clearly shows random classifier performance at the positive
    class ratio
  - Realistic fraud detection scenario with appropriate 10% class imbalance
  - Good use of fill_between to show area under curves, enhancing visual distinction
  - Clean, maintainable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; primarily uses matplotlib drawing functions
  - Could benefit from a third classifier curve to show fuller performance spectrum
    (poor performer)
  image_description: The plot displays two precision-recall curves on a white gridded
    background. The blue curve (Model A, AP = 0.81) shows excellent classifier performance,
    starting at precision 1.0 and maintaining high precision through most recall values
    before declining. A semi-transparent light blue fill area extends beneath it.
    The yellow/gold curve (Model B, AP = 0.32) shows moderate performance with an
    initially high precision that quickly drops and fluctuates between 0.3-0.7 across
    recall values, with a yellow semi-transparent fill below. A horizontal gray dashed
    line at precision 0.10 represents the random classifier baseline. Both curves
    use stepped line styles. The title "precision-recall · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. Axis labels are "Recall (Sensitivity)" on x-axis and "Precision (Positive
    Predictive Value)" on y-axis. A well-formatted legend in the upper right shows
    all three elements with their AP/P values.

        comment: Uses sns.set_style("whitegrid") for styling but PR curves are drawn
          with matplotlib ax.step() and ax.fill_between(), not seaborn plot functions.
          Seaborn does not have a native PR curve function, so this is acceptable
          but not showcasing distinctive features.
  verdict: APPROVED
