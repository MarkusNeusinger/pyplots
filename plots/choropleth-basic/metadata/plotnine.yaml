review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation using geom_polygon for regions
  - Good use of sequential Blues colormap appropriate for continuous density data
  - Realistic European population density data with accurate values
  - Well-balanced layout with proper legend sizing and positioning
  - Appropriate removal of axes for map visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Country labels have minor overlap issues in the central Europe region (Netherlands/Belgium/Germany
    area)
  - Legend scale maximum (500) does not quite encompass the actual data maximum (Netherlands
    = 521)
  - Spec requests handling of missing data but implementation does not demonstrate
    this feature
