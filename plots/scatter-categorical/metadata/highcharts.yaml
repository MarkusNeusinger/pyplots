review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clear visual separation between categories with distinct patterns
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic plant growth study scenario with meaningful data
  - Good marker sizing with white borders for distinction
  - Both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Interactive HTML reuses the 4800x2700 chart JS literal instead of regenerating
    at smaller size, causing potential sizing issues
  - No alpha transparency on markers despite spec suggestion for overlapping points
  - Legend positioned at fixed pixel offset rather than responsive positioning
