review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of tile grid approach to represent geographic choropleth without
    requiring geopandas
  - YlGnBu color palette is colorblind-accessible and well-suited for sequential data
  - Clear, readable annotations with state codes and percentage values
  - Realistic GDP growth data scenario with appropriate value ranges
  - Good overall layout with subtitle explaining the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" without the extra
    descriptive text at the start
  - Missing data cells (PR, DC) with hatched pattern not visible in the output image
  - Layout has unused whitespace on the right side that could be better utilized
  - Subtitle text differs between code and image
