review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of vector field using geom_segment with arrow aesthetics
  - Color-coded magnitude provides additional data dimension as suggested in spec
    notes
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Rotation field pattern is clearly visible and mathematically correct
  - Good arrow scaling that preserves relative magnitudes while maintaining visibility
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or at least "(dimensionless)" notation for a mathematical
    field
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 grid of arrows representing a counter-clockwise
    rotation vector field (u = -y, v = x). The arrows are positioned on a coordinate
    system ranging from approximately -4 to 4 on both axes. Arrow colors encode magnitude
    using a gradient from blue (low magnitude near center) to yellow (high magnitude
    at edges). The title "quiver-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    Axis labels show "X Position" and "Y Position". A color legend labeled "Magnitude"
    shows values from 0 to 4. The arrows clearly demonstrate the circular flow pattern
    with smaller arrows near the origin and larger arrows at the periphery.

        comment: Uses geom_segment with arrow() which is valid but plotnine doesn't
          have a native quiver geom; this is a workaround approach rather than leveraging
          distinctive plotnine/ggplot2 features
  verdict: APPROVED
