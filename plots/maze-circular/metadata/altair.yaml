review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation algorithm using Kruskal's algorithm with proper union-find
  - Clean print-friendly black/white aesthetic
  - Correct title format
  - Good wall structure with clear passages
  - Reproducible with fixed seed
  weaknesses:
  - START label renders upside down due to text rotation calculation error
  - Center goal star marker failed to render - shows malformed polygon instead of
    star shape (mark_area polygon approach did not work)
  - Altair's declarative approach struggles with custom geometric primitives like
    filled star polygons
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings,
    black walls on a white background. The title "maze-circular · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. The maze shows concentric circular walls
    with gaps for passages between rings, and radial walls dividing each ring into
    sectors. An entry point is visible at the bottom of the outer ring (a gap in the
    outer boundary). The "START" label appears at the bottom but is rendered upside
    down (inverted text). The center goal marker does not render as a star - instead
    it shows "OA" text or a malformed shape, indicating the mark_area polygon approach
    failed to produce the intended star shape. The maze itself has proper wall structure
    with varied sector counts per ring, creating a legitimate solvable maze pattern.
