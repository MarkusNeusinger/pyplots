review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of interactive slider control with CustomJS callback
    for client-side updates
  - Clean visual design with professional color scheme (Python blue/yellow)
  - Proper title format including dynamic year update in callback
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs appropriately
  - Seasonal sales pattern adds realistic data variation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend area shows some visual artifacts/rendering issues on the right side
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance the interactive experience by showing exact
    values on hover
  - The interactive note annotation could be more visually integrated
