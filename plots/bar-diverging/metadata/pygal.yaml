review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of horizontal orientation for long category labels, enhancing readability
  - Clever separation of positive and negative values into two series for proper color
    coding and legend clarity
  - Value formatter with +/- signs clearly indicates direction within each bar
  - Data sorted by value from highest to lowest enables easy pattern recognition
  - Custom style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Dual output format (PNG and HTML) leverages pygal SVG/interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes deviate from library template defaults though they work well for the
    canvas size
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart area to reduce empty space
