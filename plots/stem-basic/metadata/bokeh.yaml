review:
  strengths:
  - Clean stem plot implementation using segment + scatter combination
  - Correct title format and axis labels
  - Good color choice with appropriate alpha values
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Baseline rendered as subtle dashed line
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels missing units (e.g., "Amplitude (V)" or "Amplitude (a.u.)")
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show exact values
  - Bokeh toolbar visible in output image could be hidden for cleaner static export
  image_description: The plot displays a stem plot showing a damped oscillation signal
    with 30 data points. Blue vertical stems (#306998) extend from a dashed gray baseline
    at y=0 to circular markers at each data point. The signal starts with high amplitude
    values (~1.5) and decays over time, oscillating between positive and negative
    values before settling near zero. The title "stem-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears in the top-left. Axes are labeled "Sample Index" (x) and "Amplitude" (y).
    The Bokeh toolbar is visible in the top-right corner. Grid lines are subtle with
    dashed styling.
