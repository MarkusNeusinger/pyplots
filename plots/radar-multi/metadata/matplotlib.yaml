review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data design showing three distinct product profiles with clear trade-offs
    (Product A: Camera/Display leader, Product B: Battery/Build Quality leader, Product
    C: Performance/Value leader)'
  - Perfect polygon closure by appending first value to close the shape
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha 0.25) allows seeing overlapping areas while maintaining
    series visibility
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme using Python blue, yellow, and pink
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with clear comments
  weaknesses:
  - No distinctive matplotlib features used (could leverage custom styling, annotations,
    or advanced polar customization)
  - Radial tick labels (14pt gray) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
