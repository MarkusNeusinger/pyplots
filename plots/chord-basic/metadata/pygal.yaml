review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using pygal XY chart with Bezier curves to approximate chord
    diagram functionality
  - Good use of stroke width variation to represent flow magnitude
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with distinct hues
  - Proper square aspect ratio for circular diagram layout
  - Well-formatted title following pyplots.ai convention
  - Interactive HTML output provided alongside PNG
  - Realistic migration data scenario with meaningful bidirectional flows
  weaknesses:
  - Chord colors do not match source continent colors consistently in the overlapping
    center area
  - No entity labels directly on the diagram perimeter near the nodes
  - Legend color swatches do not perfectly match the chord colors due to color assignment
    complexity
