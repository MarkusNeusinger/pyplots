review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent directed graph visualization with clear arrow directions showing import
    dependencies
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good distinction between Core (blue), Api (yellow),
    Utils (green), and Tests (purple) groups
  - Well-positioned nodes using manual layout that minimizes edge crossings
  - Curved arrows effectively handle overlapping paths and clearly show direction
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with no functions or classes
  weaknesses:
  - Some node labels are slightly cramped within circles (e.g., validators, test_routes)
  - Node radius could be slightly larger to better accommodate longer labels
