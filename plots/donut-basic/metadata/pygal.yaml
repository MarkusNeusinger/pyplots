review:
  strengths:
  - Clean donut chart implementation with proper inner_radius creating the hollow
    center
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing at high resolution
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with meaningful category names
  - Percentage labels displayed directly on segments for easy reading
  - Well-organized legend at bottom avoiding chart overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests using center space for key metric or label, but center is empty
  - Two pairs of similar colors (blues and yellows) reduce distinguishability between
    segments
  - Does not showcase pygal interactive/tooltip capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart showing budget allocation across
    5 departments. The ring has a substantial hollow center (60% inner radius). Segments
    are colored: Engineering (35%) in steel blue, Marketing (25%) in golden yellow,
    Sales (20%) in lighter blue, Operations (12%) in pale yellow, and HR (8%) in gray.
    Percentage values are displayed on each segment. The title "donut-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark text. A horizontal legend at the bottom
    shows all 5 categories with colored squares. The overall layout is clean with
    a white background.'
