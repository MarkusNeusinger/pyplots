review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to simulate rug plot functionality
  - Interactive tooltips showing exact response time values for each tick
  - Clean data generation showing realistic clustering patterns (fast, normal, slow,
    outlier responses)
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis label with units
  - Good use of custom styling with appropriate font sizes for the canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Tick marks span 90% of vertical canvas height instead of being small tick marks
    at the axis edge as specified
  - Individual ticks in dense clusters are difficult to distinguish due to overlap
  - Unconventional rug plot appearance - traditional rug plots have short ticks, not
    full-height lines
