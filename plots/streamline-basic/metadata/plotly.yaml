review:
  strengths:
  - Clean spiral/vortex pattern effectively demonstrates streamline flow visualization
  - Proper use of Plotly figure_factory for streamline creation
  - Good line width and density settings (density=1.5, width=2.5)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Title format follows specification correctly
  - Subtle grid with visible zero lines aids interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - 'Misleading colorbar: Velocity Magnitude shown but velocities were normalized,
    making colorbar values meaningless - either remove normalization to preserve magnitude
    info or remove the colorbar entirely'
  - 'Axis range inconsistency: Code sets range [-3.5, 3.5] but rendered plot shows
    wider range, wasting canvas space'
  - Axis labels lack units or explicit dimensionless notation
