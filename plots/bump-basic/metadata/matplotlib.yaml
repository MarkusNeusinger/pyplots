review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly inverted Y-axis with rank 1 at top per spec requirements
  - Python blue (#306998) used as primary color for Team Alpha
  - Clean, readable layout with no overlapping elements
  - Realistic sports league standings scenario that clearly demonstrates rank changes
  - Legend properly positioned outside plot area using bbox_to_anchor
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 output (16x9 at 300dpi)
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom two teams (Delta, Epsilon) have limited rank movement - could show more
    dramatic position swaps to better demonstrate bump chart capabilities
  - Axis labels lack units/context (though Period and Rank are descriptive for this
    use case)
