quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features (Band, Span, Label, ColumnDataSource)
  - Clear differentiation between normal residuals and outliers using distinct colors
  - Well-designed ±2 SD reference bands with proper labeling
  - Realistic housing price prediction context with appropriate data scale
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  weaknesses:
  - The +2 SD and -2 SD labels are quite small and positioned very close to the band
    edges, making them hard to read
  - Legend text size could be slightly larger for better visibility at the 4800x2700
    resolution
