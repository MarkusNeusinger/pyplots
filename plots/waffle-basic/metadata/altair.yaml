review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waffle chart using Altair declarative syntax with
    mark_rect
  - Creative use of labelExpr to dynamically append percentages to legend labels
  - Clean visual design with rounded corners, white stroke, and well-chosen color
    palette
  - Proper 10x10 grid construction with correct row/column positioning
  - Good font sizing throughout (title 32pt, legend title 24pt, labels 20pt)
  weaknesses:
  - Could include a smaller category (<5%) to better demonstrate waffle chart capability
    with small proportions
  - Legend symbol size (500) is quite large relative to the actual grid squares
