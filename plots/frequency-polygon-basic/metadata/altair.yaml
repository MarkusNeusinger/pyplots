review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of frequency polygon with proper bin alignment across
    groups
  - Lines correctly extend to zero at both ends to close the polygon shape
  - Uses both color AND line style (strokeDash) for redundant encoding - excellent
    for accessibility
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types
  - Realistic psychology research scenario with plausible response time values
  - Proper use of np.histogram_bin_edges to ensure consistent binning across groups
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more visible (gridOpacity=0.3 is subtle)
  - Could benefit from interactive tooltips showing exact values on hover
  - Distribution shapes could show more variety to better demonstrate the plot type
  image_description: 'The plot displays three frequency polygons comparing response
    time distributions across three experimental conditions. The Control group is
    shown as a solid blue line (#306998), Treatment A as a dashed yellow line (#FFD43B),
    and Treatment B as a dotted pink/magenta line (#E377C2). Each polygon connects
    the midpoints of histogram bins and extends to zero at both ends, properly closing
    the polygon shape. The X-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately
    160 to 740, and the Y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to 40. The title follows the
    correct format: "frequency-polygon-basic · altair · pyplots.ai". A legend titled
    "Condition" is positioned on the right side, clearly identifying each group. The
    three distributions show different central tendencies and spreads: Treatment A
    peaks around 380ms with the highest frequency (~38), Control peaks around 460ms
    (~38), and Treatment B has a wider, flatter distribution centered around 420ms
    (~22 at peak). The use of distinct line styles (solid, long dash, short dash)
    provides redundant encoding beyond color alone.'
