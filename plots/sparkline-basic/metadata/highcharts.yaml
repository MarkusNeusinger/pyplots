quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimal sparkline design with no chart chrome (axes, gridlines) per specification
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color choices (orange for min, teal for max instead
    of red/green)
  - Three reference markers (start, min, max) enhance data comprehension without cluttering
  - Realistic data pattern with trend + cyclical + noise components
  - Proper use of Highcharts scatter series for point markers separate from main line
  - Good line width (10) and marker sizes for visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area instead of highcharts_core.options.series.line
  - Missing last point marker (specification mentions optional first/last points for
    reference - only first is shown)
