review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean implementation of categorical counting from raw data as spec requires
  - Good sorting by count descending for clear visualization
  - Professional color scheme with subtle border styling
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool to display exact counts on hover (Bokeh's key interactive feature)
  - Could benefit from value labels on top of bars for static PNG output
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing programming language
    popularity based on survey responses. There are 7 bars representing Python (~153),
    JavaScript (~118), Java (~74), C++ (~48), Rust (~39), Go (~37), and TypeScript
    (~30). The bars are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998) with darker blue
    outlines. The title "bar-categorical · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    center. The x-axis is labeled "Programming Language" and shows category names
    horizontally (no rotation). The y-axis is labeled "Number of Responses" with values
    from 0 to 160. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal
    grid lines. Bars are sorted in descending order by count.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and vbar correctly, but doesn't leverage Bokeh's
          interactive features (HoverTool with count display would enhance this)
  verdict: APPROVED
