review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout implementation that creates
    clear, natural cluster separation
  - Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics to layer edges below nodes
  - Good visual distinction between internal edges (solid gray) and cross-department
    bridges (dashed)
  - Node sizing by degree successfully highlights hub nodes with more connections
  - Edge thickness varies by weight as specified
  - Realistic team collaboration scenario demonstrates force-directed graph use case
    perfectly
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate white background and hidden axes
  weaknesses:
  - Legend sorts departments alphabetically rather than by spatial position or logical
    grouping
  - Yellow color for Design department may have lower contrast against white background
  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph representing
    team collaboration across 4 departments. The graph shows 40 nodes (circles) colored
    by department: Engineering (blue/steel blue), Design (yellow/gold), Marketing
    (green), and Sales (orange/coral). Nodes are sized by degree (number of connections),
    with more connected individuals appearing larger. The departments form distinct
    clusters with dense internal connections (solid gray lines) and sparse cross-department
    bridges (dashed gray lines). The title reads "Team Collaboration · network-force-directed
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend in the upper-left corner identifies
    the four departments. The background is white with no axes or grid lines, appropriate
    for network visualization. The layout successfully shows community structure with
    Engineering (left), Design/Marketing (center), and Sales (right) naturally separated.'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_segment and geom_point layering,
          scale_color_manual, and theme customization. The force-directed algorithm
          is implemented manually rather than using any library-specific features
          (which plotnine doesn't have for networks).
  verdict: APPROVED
