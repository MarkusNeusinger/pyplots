review:
  strengths:
  - Clear, readable visualization with good text sizing and spacing
  - Set2 color palette provides excellent colorblind accessibility
  - White rounded boxes behind counts ensure readability against all backgrounds
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic programming language survey context
  - Clean equilateral triangle arrangement of circles
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is not meaningfully used for plotting - only styling (set_theme) and color
    palette extraction. The actual diagram is drawn with matplotlib patches.
  - No legend explaining what the colors represent (relies on inline labels only)
  - Could add a subtitle or annotation explaining the data source/context
