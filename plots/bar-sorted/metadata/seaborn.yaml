review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal layout choice for long category labels, following spec recommendation
  - Value labels positioned cleanly at the end of each bar with proper formatting
    ($XXXk)
  - Correct use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clear visual hierarchy with descending sort from largest to smallest
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principle
  - X-axis extended appropriately to prevent label clipping
  weaknesses:
  - Uses monochromatic palette instead of seaborn built-in color palettes like colorblind
    or Blues which could add visual interest
  - Grid uses dashed linestyle which is slightly more prominent than recommended
