review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear clade-based color coding throughout branches
    and labels
  - Biologically accurate evolutionary distance matrix for primate species
  - Professional typography with proper font sizes and weights for all text elements
  - Thoughtful color palette using distinct, colorblind-safe colors for 5 clades
  - Clean layout with appropriate use of seaborn aesthetic styling
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (get_link_color) which violates KISS principle - inline
    logic preferred
  - Title format includes Primate Evolution prefix before spec-id which deviates from
    standard format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal phylogenetic tree (dendrogram)
    showing primate evolutionary relationships. The tree branches from left to right,
    with 10 species labels on the right edge (Tarsier, Lemur, Chimpanzee, Human, Gorilla,
    Orangutan, Gibbon, Macaque, Baboon, Marmoset). Branch colors encode clades: red
    for Prosimians (Tarsier, Lemur), dark blue for Great Apes (Human, Chimpanzee,
    Gorilla), light blue for Lesser Apes (Orangutan, Gibbon), yellow/gold for Old
    World Monkeys (Baboon, Macaque), and green for New World Monkeys (Marmoset). The
    x-axis shows "Evolutionary Distance (Million Years)" from 50 to 0. A legend in
    the lower-left identifies the 5 clades. The title reads "Primate Evolution · tree-phylogenetic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Branch lines are thick (3px) and species labels are colored
    to match their clade.'

        comment: Uses `sns.set_theme()` and `sns.despine()` for styling, but the core
          dendrogram is from scipy. Seaborn enhances aesthetics but doesn't provide
          native tree/dendrogram functions.
  verdict: APPROVED
