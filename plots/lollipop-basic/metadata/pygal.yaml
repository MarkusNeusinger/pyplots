review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lollipop chart using pygal XY chart with creative
    baseline dot hiding technique
  - Clean horizontal orientation that handles category labels well
  - Proper title format and color scheme following pyplots standards
  - Data sorted by value for optimal readability as recommended in spec
  - Good canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with appropriate font scaling
  weaknesses:
  - Missing y_title axis label (could add Product Category or similar)
  - Font sizes in Style could be better optimized for the large canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal lollipop chart with 8 product
    categories (Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets, Headphones, Smartwatches, Cameras,
    Speakers, Gaming) on the y-axis and sales values ranging from 0 to ~900 units
    on the x-axis. Each category has a thin horizontal blue line (stem) extending
    from the baseline (x=0) to a circular blue dot at the data value. The data is
    sorted in descending order by value (Smartphones highest at ~892, Gaming lowest
    at ~134). The chart uses a consistent Python Blue (#306998) color for all elements.
    The title "lollipop-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Subtle gray
    grid lines are visible in the background, and the x-axis label reads "Sales (units)".

        comment: Uses XY chart with custom node styling to hide baseline dots, custom
          Style class, SVG rendering. Creative workaround for lollipop using XY coordinates.
  verdict: APPROVED
