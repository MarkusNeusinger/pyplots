review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation algorithm using DFS with proper wall carving
  - Clean visual design with black walls on white background, perfect for printing
  - 'Good use of plotnine grammar: geom_segment for walls, geom_point for goal, geom_text
    for labels'
  - Proper coordinate handling with coord_fixed(ratio=1) for circular accuracy
  - Well-structured sector scaling (increasing sectors per ring from center to edge)
  weaknesses:
  - Entry gap on outer ring is subtle and could be more visually prominent
  - The difficulty parameter is defined but not actively used to vary passage density
  - Helper function get_neighbors() adds complexity, though necessary for the maze
    algorithm
  image_description: The plot shows a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings
    on a white background. The maze has black walls that form both arc segments (circular
    walls between rings) and radial walls (walls dividing sectors within each ring).
    The center has a blue dot labeled "GOAL" in golden-yellow text above it. On the
    right edge of the outer boundary, the word "START" appears in dark blue (#306998)
    indicating the entry point. The outer boundary is a complete circle with a visible
    gap near the START label for entry. The maze structure increases in sector complexity
    from the center outward, creating a visually interesting pattern. The title "maze-circular
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.

        comment: Uses plotnine grammar (ggplot + geom_segment + geom_point + geom_text
          + theme_void + coord_fixed), but maze plotting is not a typical plotnine
