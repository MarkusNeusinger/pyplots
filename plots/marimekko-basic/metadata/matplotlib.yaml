review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Marimekko concept with proportional bar widths
    and stacked segments
  - Clear value labels on larger segments with smart color contrast (white on dark
    blue, black on light colors)
  - Professional appearance with Python signature colors and colorblind-safe palette
  - Region totals displayed below each bar provide useful context
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside plot creates empty space in upper right corner; could
    be positioned inside the plot area
  - The y-axis label is clear but the plot would benefit from a subtitle explaining
    the width interpretation
