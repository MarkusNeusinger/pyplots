review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal XY chart type for precise coordinate control
  - Creative approach to simulate vertical event lines using line segments
  - Good custom styling with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Proper color differentiation for each event type
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic stock price data with proper volatility characteristics
  weaknesses:
  - Event labels appear only in the legend, not as text annotations directly on the
    chart near the event markers (spec requests text labels at events)
  - Vertical dashed lines could be more prominent (thicker stroke or bolder dashing)
