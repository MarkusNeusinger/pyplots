review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including zero reference line
    with label, smoothed trend line, and proper transparency
  - Symmetric y-axis around zero as recommended for residual plots
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between scatter points and trend line
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good data generation showing realistic residual patterns with intentional outliers
    and mild heteroscedasticity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or more specific context (could use parenthetical explanations)
  - Margins are generous but slightly excessive, reducing the effective plot area
  - Trend line label says Trend (Smoothed) but spec suggests LOWESS/LOESS terminology
    would be more precise
