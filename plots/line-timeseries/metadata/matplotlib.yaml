review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib.dates module with MonthLocator and DateFormatter for
    intelligent date tick handling
  - Clean seasonal temperature simulation with realistic sinusoidal pattern and daily
    noise
  - Proper axis label rotation (45°) prevents overlap on date labels
  - Good visual hierarchy with major/minor grid lines at different alpha levels
  - Title follows the required pyplots.ai format perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Line could be slightly thicker (3.0 instead of 2.5) for better visibility at full
    resolution with 366 data points
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing daily temperature
    data for the year 2024. A single blue line (#306998) with linewidth 2.5 connects
    daily temperature readings ranging from approximately -5°C to +35°C. The x-axis
    shows monthly date labels (Jan 2024 through Dec 2024) rotated 45 degrees for readability.
    The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" with values from roughly -5 to 35. The title
    reads "Daily Temperature 2024 · line-timeseries · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A
    light gray dashed grid (major and minor) aids readability. The plot shows a clear
    seasonal sinusoidal pattern with peak temperatures in summer (June-August) and
    lowest temperatures in winter months.
