  strengths:
  - Excellent use of real sklearn diabetes dataset providing meaningful, interpretable
    results
  - Well-implemented confidence band showing prediction variability
  - Rug plot effectively shows training data distribution along x-axis
  - Zero reference line aids interpretation of relative effects
  - Proper centering of partial dependence values for easier interpretation
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate font sizes and colors
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend incorrectly labels mean ± 1 std as 95% Confidence Interval (should be ±1
    Standard Deviation or compute actual 95% CI)
  - The PDP curve shows step-like artifacts suggesting the gradient boosting model
    structure is visible; a smoother curve would be more typical
  image_description: The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) for BMI (Body
    Mass Index, standardized) on the x-axis against Partial Dependence (centered)
    on the y-axis. The main PDP line is shown in dark blue (#306998), showing a clear
    positive monotonic relationship - as BMI increases, partial dependence increases
    from approximately -40 at the lowest BMI values to about +60 at the highest. A
    light blue semi-transparent confidence band (labeled "95% Confidence Interval")
    surrounds the main line, showing prediction variability. A rug plot consisting
    of small vertical gray lines near y=50 shows the distribution of training data
    values along the x-axis, with data concentrated between -0.05 and 0.08. A horizontal
    dashed gray line at y=0 serves as a reference. The title "pdp-basic · plotly ·
    pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. The legend is positioned in the upper-left
    corner with a white semi-transparent background.

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate; legend is well-placed with semi-transparent
          background; however the legend label says "95% Confidence Interval" but
          this is actually mean ± 1 standard deviation, not a 95% CI
