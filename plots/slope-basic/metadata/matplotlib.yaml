review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent label collision avoidance algorithm prevents text overlap
  - Clean color coding distinguishes increases from decreases effectively
  - Professional styling with removed top/right/bottom spines for clean slopegraph
    aesthetic
  - Properly sized text elements for high-resolution output (4800x2700)
  - Realistic business context with quarterly product sales comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels on the left side show adjusted positions that do not align perfectly
    with the actual data point markers
  - Legend placed in upper right could be more elegantly positioned below the title
    or integrated differently
  - Right-side labels only show values without product names, requiring visual line-following
    to identify products
