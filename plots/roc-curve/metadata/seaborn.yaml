review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and well-contrasted line colors
  - Complete spec compliance including diagonal reference line, AUC annotations, and
    correct title format
  - Realistic machine learning context comparing three classifiers with believable
    performance differences
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Equal aspect ratio makes the curve shapes easy to interpret correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Uses seaborn minimally - only lineplot and styling, which does not showcase seaborn
    distinctive features
  - Yellow/gold color for Logistic Regression could be slightly harder to distinguish
    for colorblind viewers
