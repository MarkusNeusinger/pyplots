review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bullet chart using lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with
    stacked geom_bar for ranges
  - Creative use of geom_tile for target markers as thin vertical lines
  - Perfect grayscale color scheme following Stephen Few design guidelines
  - Multiple KPIs with varying performance levels demonstrate comparison capability
  - Clean normalization approach allows comparison across metrics with different scales
  weaknesses:
  - None significant - implementation meets all quality criteria
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bullet chart with 4 KPI metrics
    (Revenue, Profit, Customer Satisfaction, Market Share) arranged vertically. Each
    metric shows three grayscale background bands (dark gray for Poor, medium gray
    for Satisfactory, light gray for Good), a blue (#306998) horizontal bar representing
    actual performance, and a black vertical marker indicating the target value. The
    title "bullet-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The x-axis
    is labeled "Performance (%)" ranging from 0-110, and a legend at the bottom explains
    the performance ranges. The design follows Stephen Few's bullet chart specification
    with clean, minimal styling.
