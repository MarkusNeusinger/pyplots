review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh Whisker model with TeeHead for professional error bar caps
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business data scenario with appropriate variation
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars annotation appears partially cut off at right edge
  - Only symmetric error bars shown; spec mentions asymmetric errors as a feature
  - Grid alpha could be more subtle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 5 product categories
    (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books) on the x-axis and Quarterly
    Revenue in millions on the y-axis. Bars are rendered in a medium blue color (#306998)
    with dark outlines. Each bar has black error bars with visible horizontal caps
    (TeeHead style) at both ends, representing ±1 standard deviation. The title "bar-error
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left. An annotation "Error bars: ±1 SD"
    is visible in the top-right corner. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with
    subtle dashed horizontal grid lines. Y-axis starts at 0 and extends to ~108. All
    text is legible and well-sized.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, Whisker with TeeHead for error bars, Label
          for annotation - good Bokeh idioms but could leverage more interactive features
  verdict: APPROVED
