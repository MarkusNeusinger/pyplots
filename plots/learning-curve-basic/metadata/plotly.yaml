review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and well-balanced layout
  - Perfect spec compliance including title format and all required features
  - Realistic simulated data showing characteristic learning curve behavior with convergence
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  - Blue/yellow color scheme provides excellent colorblind accessibility and contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Accuracy Score 0-1 or metric specification)
  - Could leverage Plotly interactive hover templates to show exact values and fold
    statistics
  - Data shows a relatively mild overfitting scenario; more dramatic gap could better
    illustrate the concept
