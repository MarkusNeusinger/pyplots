review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the pyramid chart using the negative-value technique
    for left-extending bars
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper categorical ordering
  - 'Appropriate color contrast (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B) for gender differentiation'
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper theming for high-resolution
    output
  - Realistic population data that demonstrates demographic patterns (larger elderly
    female population)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order (Female, Male) does not match visual order (Male on left, Female
    on right) - consider reordering
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid chart with 9 age groups
    (0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+) arranged vertically
    on the y-axis labeled "Age Group". Blue bars representing Male population extend
    leftward from the center axis, while golden-yellow bars representing Female population
    extend rightward. The x-axis is labeled "Population (thousands)" with symmetric
    scale ranging from -6000 to 6000. The title reads "Population by Age & Gender
    · pyramid-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend on the right side
    shows "Gender" with Female (yellow) and Male (blue). The chart uses a minimal
    theme with subtle gray gridlines. The pyramid shape is clearly visible with the
    widest bars at 40-49 age group and tapering at both youngest (0-9) and oldest
    (80+) groups.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_col, coord_flip, scale_fill_manual,
          and theme customization. Could leverage more plotnine-specific features
          like position adjustments or stat transformations
