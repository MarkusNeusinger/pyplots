review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of EMA calculation using pandas ewm()
  - Clear visual hierarchy with price line thicker than EMAs
  - Crossover markers effectively highlight trading signals with appropriate green/red
    colors and triangle markers
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good use of whitegrid style and subtle grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows some visual artifacts from the iteration approach; using seaborn
    hue parameter with the long-format data would be more idiomatic
  - The EMA 12 yellow line could have slightly better contrast against the white background
  image_description: 'The plot displays an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicator
    chart with a stock price time series spanning from January 2024 to June 2024.
    Three line series are shown: a dark blue "Close Price" line showing the most volatile
    actual price movements, a yellow "EMA 12" line (12-day EMA), and a red "EMA 26"
    line (26-day EMA). The EMAs are visibly smoother than the close price and lag
    behind price movements. The chart features crossover markers: green upward triangles
    indicate bullish crossovers (short EMA crosses above long EMA) and dark red downward
    triangles indicate bearish crossovers (short EMA crosses below long EMA). The
    price trends downward from around $158 to about $125 before recovering to around
    $135. The title correctly follows the format "indicator-ema · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    Axes are labeled with "Date" on x-axis and "Price (USD)" on y-axis. A legend in
    the upper left corner clearly identifies all three series. The grid is subtle
    with dashed lines.'
