review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with four distinct trend patterns (steady growth,
    gradual growth, seasonal variation)
  - Clean, professional color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-configured font sizes and margins for the large canvas
  - Good use of dots to highlight individual data points
  - Descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-left could be closer to the data area or at bottom
  - Data is deterministic but CQ-02 scoring convention expects explicit seed comment
    for clarity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-line chart showing monthly sales data
    for 4 product lines over 12 months. Four distinct colored lines are visible: a
    blue line (Electronics) showing strong growth from ~45 to 110, a yellow line (Clothing)
    with gradual growth from ~38 to 88, an orange line (Home Goods) with steady growth
    from ~28 to 72, and a teal line (Sports) showing a seasonal pattern that rises
    from ~22 to peak around 72 in July-August then declines to ~28 in December. The
    title "line-multi · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center. A legend
    in the top-left identifies all four series. The Y-axis shows "Sales (thousands
    USD)" and the X-axis shows "Month" with labels from Jan to Dec. Circular markers
    appear at each data point. Horizontal dotted grid lines help with value reading.'

        comment: All text is readable, title and axis labels are clear, legend is
          legible. Slightly smaller than optimal for the canvas size.

        comment: Lines and dots are visible, stroke width of 8 and dot size of 12
          work well. Lines could be slightly thicker for the large canvas.

        comment: Good use of canvas, plot fills most of the space. Legend placement
          in top-left is functional but slightly distant from the plot area.

          positioned slightly far from the data area.

        comment: Uses pygal.Line with custom Style, show_dots, dots_size, and legend
          configuration. Could leverage more pygal-specific features like tooltips
          or fill options.
  verdict: APPROVED
