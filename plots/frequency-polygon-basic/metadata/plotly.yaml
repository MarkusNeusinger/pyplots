review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-differentiated line colors and styles (dashed
    for Sleep Deprived)
  - Perfect spec compliance - all required features implemented including polygon
    extension to zero
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario using reaction time research
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of plotly semi-transparent fills (tozeroy)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is quite subtle - could be 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - Could leverage more plotly-specific interactivity features (range slider, dropdown)
  image_description: 'The plot displays three frequency polygons comparing reaction
    time distributions across experimental conditions. The X-axis shows "Reaction
    Time (ms)" ranging from 100 to 700, and the Y-axis shows "Frequency" ranging from
    0 to 40. Three groups are visualized: Control (blue solid line with circular markers,
    peaked around 350-380ms), Caffeine (yellow/gold solid line with circular markers,
    peaked around 240-260ms showing faster reactions), and Sleep Deprived (red/coral
    dashed line with circular markers, peaked around 440-500ms showing slower, more
    variable reactions). Each polygon has a semi-transparent fill beneath the line.
    The title "frequency-polygon-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The legend is positioned in the upper-right corner with a white background and
    subtle border. The layout uses a clean white template with subtle gridlines.'
