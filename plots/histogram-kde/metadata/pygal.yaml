review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of histogram-KDE visualization using pygal XY chart capabilities
  - Creative approach using step-like XY path to simulate histogram bars since pygal.Histogram
    has different semantics
  - Clean manual KDE implementation using Scott rule for bandwidth estimation
  - Semi-transparent histogram (opacity=0.55) allows KDE curve visibility as spec
    recommends
  - Properly scaled density values (not raw counts) making histogram and KDE comparable
  - Good color contrast between blue histogram and red KDE curve
  - Appropriate font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent and could use subtle alpha adjustment
  - KDE curve stroke width could be slightly more prominent against the filled area
