review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of parallel categories from first principles using Bokeh
    patches API
  - Smooth bezier curves for ribbons create professional appearance
  - Color scheme (Python blue/yellow + green) is distinctive and colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic product journey data with conditional probabilities creates meaningful
    flow patterns
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  - Text sizes appropriately scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Some thinner ribbons representing less common paths are harder to trace visually
  - Legend placement in upper right creates slight visual imbalance with the main
    chart
