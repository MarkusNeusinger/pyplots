review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to implement Chernoff faces in Altair using layered point marks
    to simulate face shapes
  - Good use of color encoding by species for immediate visual grouping
  - Well-organized grid layout with 12 faces showing clear variation
  - Feature mapping legend is helpful for understanding the visualization
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle
  - Clean, reproducible code with appropriate seed
  weaknesses:
  - The circle-based face approximation creates blobby irregular face shapes rather
    than smooth ellipses
  - Feature mapping text in bottom left slightly overlaps with Sample 9 label area
  - Some versicolor faces appear quite similar, making individual differentiation
    harder
