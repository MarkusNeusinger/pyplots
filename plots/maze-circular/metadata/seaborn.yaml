review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation algorithm using Kruskals algorithm ensures exactly one
    solution
  - Clean black-on-white aesthetic perfect for print-friendly output
  - Creative use of sns.heatmap to render the maze grid
  - Clear entry point marker and goal star at center
  - Proper title formatting following the spec-id library pyplots.ai convention
  - Good colorblind accessibility with high contrast design
  weaknesses:
  - Legend elements (Entry Point and Goal markers explanation) are defined in code
    but not visible in the rendered output
  - The START label positioning could be improved to ensure it is always visible regardless
    of entry location
  - Wall thickness appears slightly inconsistent in some areas due to grid-based rendering
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle rendered using a seaborn
    heatmap. The maze consists of 7 concentric rings divided into 12 sectors each.
    Dark gray/black walls on a white background create the maze pathways. At the center
    is a blue circular goal area with a yellow/gold star symbol. On the outer edge
    (right side), there's a blue circular marker labeled "START" indicating the entry
    point. The entry opening is visible as a gap in the outer boundary wall. The title
    "maze-circular · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.
    The maze uses Kruskal's algorithm to ensure exactly one solution path. The image
    is square format (12x12 inches at 300dpi = 3600x3600px). No legend is visible
    in the current render (the code includes legend elements but they may be outside
    the visible area or very small).

        comment: Uses sns.heatmap as primary plotting function, which is appropriate,
          but this is a creative workaround rather than seaborns intended use case
