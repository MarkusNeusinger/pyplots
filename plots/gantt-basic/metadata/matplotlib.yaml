review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme using Python-branded colors with good accessibility
  - Clean implementation with proper date handling using matplotlib.dates
  - Logical task ordering by start date (reversed for top-to-bottom reading)
  - Today marker with dashed red line adds practical utility
  - Proper bar spacing and sizing for clear readability
  - Complete legend including all categories and the Today marker
  - Subtle x-axis grid without overwhelming the visualization
  - Good use of tight_layout and bbox_inches for clean output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Timeline, Tasks) - could be more descriptive like Project
    Timeline (2025) and Project Tasks
  - Could leverage more matplotlib features like annotations for key milestones
