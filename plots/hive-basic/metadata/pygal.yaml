review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept using pygal XY chart as creative
    workaround
  - Clean curved Bezier edges properly routing through center area with differentiated
    same-axis and cross-axis connections
  - Well-structured software dependency network data demonstrating realistic use case
  - Good color coding with colorblind-safe palette for three module categories
  - Proper tooltip implementation with module names and degree values
  - Correct title format following specification
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization could be improved; hive structure is small compared to available
    space
  - Missing axis labels at end of each radial axis (Core, Utility, Interface text
    at endpoints)
  - Edge colors are uniform gray; could use coloring to show connection patterns by
    source axis
