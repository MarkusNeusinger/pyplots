review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly stackgroup with groupnorm=percent for proper 100% stacking
  - Clean professional visual appearance with well-sized fonts
  - Realistic energy market share scenario showing energy transition story
  - Good use of hovertemplate for informative tooltips
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  - Proper normalization logic in data preparation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order reversed from visual stacking order - Hydro first in legend but at
    top of stack
  - Two green shades (Hydro olive and Wind bright) may be difficult to distinguish
    for colorblind users
