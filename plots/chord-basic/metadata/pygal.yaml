review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using XY chart with Bezier curves to simulate chord diagram
    in a library without native support
  - KISS compliance fixed - Bezier curve calculation is now inline, no functions
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with 6 distinct hues
  - Realistic migration data scenario demonstrating bidirectional flows
  - Clean code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: should be "chord-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" without
    the "Continental Migration" prefix'
  - Legend displays small colored squares in a column pattern for each continent entry
    instead of a single clean color swatch
  - Stroke width variation (intended to show flow magnitude) is not clearly visible
    in the final output
