review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    with proper physics simulation
  - 'Good use of Bokeh interactive features: hover tooltips showing team, node ID,
    and connections'
  - Clear visual separation of three communities through both color and spatial positioning
  - Node sizing scaled by degree effectively highlights hub nodes
  - Proper colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be integrated better within the plot area rather than added
    as separate layout
  - Some peripheral nodes appear quite small at the edges of communities
  image_description: 'The plot shows a force-directed network graph with 50 nodes
    divided into 3 communities: Engineering (coral/red), Marketing (yellow), and Sales
    (blue). The three communities are visually separated across the canvas - Engineering
    in the upper left area, Marketing in the lower middle area, and Sales in the right
    area. Nodes are connected by light gray edges. Hub nodes (with 7+ connections)
    are labeled with "Hub" text above them. Node sizes vary based on their degree
    (number of connections). The title "network-force-directed · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend labeled "Teams" showing the three community colors
    is positioned in the upper left. The white background is clean with no axes or
    grid lines. Bokeh toolbar icons are visible in the upper right corner.'

          smaller nodes could be a bit larger for optimal visibility at edges

        comment: Legend is functional but positioned via `add_layout` to "left" placing
          it in upper-left corner; it works but could integrate better with the plot
          area
