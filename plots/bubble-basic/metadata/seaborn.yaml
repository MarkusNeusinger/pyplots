review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent size legend implementation with proxy bubbles showing three reference
    sizes
  - Proper area-based scaling for bubble sizes (meeting spec requirement)
  - Good transparency (alpha=0.6) for handling overlapping bubbles as spec recommends
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper DataFrame usage
  - Title format exactly matches required format with middle dots
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than having real-world context
    with units
  - Could leverage seaborn hue parameter to add color as optional fourth dimension
    per spec suggestion
  - Data context is synthetic without a compelling real-world scenario
