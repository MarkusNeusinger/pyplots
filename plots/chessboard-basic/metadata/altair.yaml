review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of chess board using Altair declarative approach
  - Perfect color scheme with classic wheat/saddle brown contrast
  - Correct chess convention with h1 as light square
  - Clean use of ordinal encoding for both axes
  - Proper 1:1 aspect ratio for square board
  - Subtle stroke on squares enhances visual clarity
  - Good use of configure_view for outer border styling
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack descriptive context, though contextually acceptable for chess
    notation
  - Data generation loop could include a brief comment explaining the coloring logic
  image_description: 'The plot displays a classic 8x8 chess board with alternating
    light (wheat/cream #F5DEB3) and dark (saddle brown #8B4513) squares. The board
    is properly oriented with row labels 1-8 on the left side (1 at bottom, 8 at top)
    and column labels a-h at the bottom. The title "chessboard-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. The squares have subtle dark brown borders
    (#5D4037) that enhance clarity. The light square appears correctly at h1 (bottom-right
    corner) following standard chess convention. The overall layout is square (1:1
    aspect ratio) with the board filling most of the canvas. The chart has a thin
    dark brown outer border framing the entire visualization.'
