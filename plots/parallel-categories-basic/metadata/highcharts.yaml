  strengths:
  - Excellent data visualization showing clear passenger flow through all four Titanic
    categories
  - Good use of colorblind-friendly palette for most categories with semantic color
    choices
  - Proper use of Highcharts Sankey module with column positioning to create parallel
    categories effect
  - Clean node labeling with display name mapping for readability
  - Helpful dimension labels at the bottom to orient viewers
  - Accessibility features enabled with descriptive text
  - Interactive hover states enhance usability
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green color combination for Survived/Died may be difficult for colorblind
    users; consider using blue/orange instead
  - The code complexity for node naming (suffixes like _M1, _AM1) could be simplified
  image_description: The plot displays a Sankey/parallel categories diagram showing
    Titanic passenger survival data flowing through four dimensions. The leftmost
    column shows passenger classes (1st Class in blue, 2nd Class in purple, 3rd Class
    in cyan). The second column shows Sex (Male in dark blue, Female in pink). The
    third column shows Age Group (Adult in purple, Child in sage green). The rightmost
    column shows Outcome (Survived in green, Died in red). Ribbons connect categories
    proportionally by passenger count, with the largest flows showing 3rd Class male
    adults who died. The title "Titanic Survival · parallel-categories-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at top with a subtitle explaining the flow. Dimension labels
    (Class, Sex, Age Group, Outcome) appear at the bottom.

        comment: Uses a diverse palette that is mostly colorblind-friendly, though
          red/green for Survived/Died could be problematic for some viewers

        comment: N/A for parallel categories (no traditional axes), but dimension

        comment: No grid needed; legend disabled since nodes are self-labeled, which
          is appropriate

        comment: Uses Sankey module, accessibility options, custom node positioning,
          hover states, and animation. Could use more advanced features like drilldown.
