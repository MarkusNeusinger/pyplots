review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical layout clearly showing software dependency structure from
    top (App) to bottom (utilities)
  - Clean use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with geom_segment arrows and geom_point
    for nodes
  - Well-chosen color palette distinguishing four module types (application, core,
    infrastructure, utility)
  - Proper edge shortening to prevent arrow overlap with nodes
  - Correct title format and professional styling with theme_void
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate bidirectional edges (curved edges) as mentioned in spec for
    nodes with mutual connections
  - File handling code (os, shutil for moving files from lets-plot-images) adds unnecessary
    complexity
  - HTML export could leverage lets-plot interactive features like tooltips showing
    module details
  image_description: 'The plot displays a directed network graph visualizing software
    package dependencies. At the top sits a dark blue "App" node, connected by arrows
    to a yellow "API" node below. The API node then branches out to multiple modules:
    Auth (yellow), Database (yellow), and Cache (green) in the middle layer. At the
    bottom layer are HTTP Client (green), Queue (green), Config (purple), and Logger
    (purple). A separate Utils node (purple) appears on the right side. Arrows with
    closed triangle heads show the direction of dependencies, all using a consistent
    gray color. The background is clean white (theme_void), and a legend on the right
    shows four module types: application (blue), core (yellow), infrastructure (green),
    and utility (purple).'
