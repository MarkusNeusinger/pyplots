review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Renko chart algorithm with proper reversal logic (2x
    brick size for reversals)
  - Clean, readable code with proper brick calculation loop
  - Good use of geom_rect with custom aesthetics for xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax
  - Proper color scheme matching spec requirements (green for bullish, red for bearish)
  - Well-formatted title and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid is extremely subtle and nearly invisible; spec recommends subtle grid to
    help identify price levels - current grid alpha is too low
  - Could use scale_x_continuous to add more meaningful tick marks on the brick index
    axis
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 55 bricks
    showing price movements over time. The chart uses teal/green (#26A69A) bricks
    for bullish (upward) movements and coral/red (#EF5350) bricks for bearish (downward)
    movements. The bricks are uniform in size ($2 each) and clearly separated with
    small gaps. The X-axis shows "Brick Index" ranging from 0 to about 55, and the
    Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately 84 to 112. The chart demonstrates
    clear trend patterns with an initial uptrend, followed by a significant downtrend
    reaching a low around brick 22-25, then a recovery and another uptrend. A legend
    on the right side clearly identifies "Bearish" and "Bullish" directions. The title
    follows the correct format: "renko-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The background
    is clean with subtle gridlines.'

        comment: Grid is very subtle (almost invisible), legend is well-placed but
          grid could be slightly more visible to help identify price levels as spec

        comment: Uses geom_rect effectively for the Renko bricks which is appropriate,
          but does not leverage other distinctive plotnine features like faceting
          or statistical transformations
