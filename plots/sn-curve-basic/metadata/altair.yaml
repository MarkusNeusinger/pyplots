review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Basquin equation for generating realistic fatigue
    data with appropriate scatter
  - Clean layered composition combining scatter points, fit line, and reference rules
  - Good use of Altair encoding system for color-coded legend of material properties
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Clear descriptive axis labels with proper units
  - Well-chosen marker size and opacity for data density
  weaknesses:
  - The three fatigue regions (low-cycle, high-cycle, infinite life) are not explicitly
    annotated or visually distinguished
  - Reference line dash pattern could be more distinctive from grid lines
  - Title styling could be more prominent (bolder weight)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) with logarithmic
    scales on both axes. The x-axis shows "Cycles to Failure (N)" ranging from 100
    to 100,000,000, and the y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from 100
    to 1,000. Blue filled circular markers represent individual fatigue test data
    points (~40 points) with visible scatter at each stress level. A blue trend line
    (Basquin fit) runs through the data from upper-left to lower-right. Three horizontal
    dashed reference lines indicate material properties: red dashed line at 520 MPa
    for Ultimate Strength, yellow/gold dashed line at 380 MPa for Yield Strength,
    and green dashed line at 150 MPa for Endurance Limit. A legend titled "Material
    Properties" is positioned in the upper-right corner. The title "sn-curve-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The plot uses a clean white background
    with subtle grid lines.'
