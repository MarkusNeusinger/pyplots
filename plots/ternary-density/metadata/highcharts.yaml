review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary density using Highcharts heatmap with custom
    SVG renderer overlays
  - Uses viridis colormap correctly with proper perceptual uniformity
  - Three distinct density clusters clearly demonstrate multimodal compositional data
  - Grid lines drawn at correct angles for ternary plots (parallel to each edge)
  - Realistic geological sediment composition context
  - Proper masking of heatmap cells outside the triangle boundary using barycentric
    coordinates
  weaknesses:
  - Minor jagged edges visible at triangle boundaries due to square heatmap cell rasterization
  - Tick labels only appear on the bottom edge; left and right edges lack percentage
    markers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density visualization showing sediment
    composition (sand/silt/clay) as a kernel density heatmap within an equilateral
    triangle. The triangle has three labeled vertices: "Sand (100%)" at bottom-left
    in blue text, "Silt (100%)" at bottom-right in blue text, and "Clay (100%)" at
    the top in blue text. The density is represented using a viridis colormap ranging
    from dark purple (low density, 0) to bright yellow (high density, 1). Three distinct
    density clusters are visible: (1) a high-density yellow cluster in the bottom-left
    corner corresponding to sand-dominated compositions, (2) a high-density cluster
    in the upper portion corresponding to clay-rich sediments, and (3) a moderate-density
    region at the top-right edge corresponding to silt-dominated compositions. Grid
    lines are visible within the triangle at 10% intervals, appearing as subtle gray
    lines. The bottom edge has percentage tick labels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%). A color
    legend labeled "Density" appears on the right side showing the scale from 0 to
    1. The title follows the correct format "ternary-density · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    with a subtitle indicating "Sediment Composition: Sand/Silt/Clay Distribution
    (n=500)".'
