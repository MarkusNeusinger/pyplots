quality_score: 72
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative approach with layered composition
  - Proper algorithmic maze generation using randomized Kruskal algorithm ensuring
    single solution
  - Good use of detail encoding to render separate wall segments
  - Print-friendly black and white color scheme as specified
  - Proper title format following spec
  weaknesses:
  - Entry label START appears inverted/upside-down - should be oriented correctly
    for readability
  - Center goal marker shows OA instead of the intended star - Unicode character rendering
    issue
  - Code violates KISS principle by using helper functions (find, union, add_arc,
    add_radial)
  - Chart dimensions result in slight elliptical distortion - should be perfectly
    circular
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings.
    Black walls on a white background form the maze structure with concentric circular
    arcs and radial line segments creating pathways. At the center is a light blue/gray
    circle with "OA" text (likely intended to be a star goal marker but rendered as
    text). At the bottom of the maze is an entry point with "START" text displayed
    in blue, though it appears upside-down/inverted. The title "maze-circular · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in black text. The maze has good overall
    circular structure with visible passages between rings and sectors.
