review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visual design with consistent steel blue color
  - Data sorted by value (highest to lowest) for easy comparison as recommended in
    spec
  - Excellent use of pygal print_values feature to display percentages on bars
  - Realistic programming language survey data that is immediately relatable
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas sizing with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels not shown directly on y-axis; users must cross-reference the legend
    at bottom to identify each bar
  - Legend placement at bottom separates labels from their corresponding bars, reducing
    readability
  - Value labels on bars (18.6%, 16.3%, 12.9%) are positioned inside bars making them
    harder to read against the blue background
