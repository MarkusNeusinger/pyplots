review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data representation with clear parent-child relationships
  - Consistent color scheme within branches (Engineering teams in blue variations,
    Sales teams in yellow variations)
  - Realistic company budget scenario with meaningful department/team structure
  - Proper use of branchvalues=total for accurate proportional representation
  - Custom hover template provides useful budget information
  - Clean white line separators between segments enhance readability
  - Radial text orientation improves label placement
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring segments (HR, Brand) have relatively similar sizes, reducing visual
    variation
  - Chart could be slightly larger to better utilize canvas space for maximum visual
    impact
