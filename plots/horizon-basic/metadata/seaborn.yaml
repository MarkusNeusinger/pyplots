review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart concept with proper band folding algorithm
  - Clean separation of positive (blue) and negative (red) deviations with 3 intensity
    levels each
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with distinct patterns per server (daily
    cycles, spikes, periodic flushes)
  - Effective use of seaborn color palettes and styling features
  - Properly formatted title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between for core visualization rather than seaborn plotting
    functions (acceptable limitation for horizon charts)
  - Grid lines are quite subtle and could be slightly more visible for time tracking
  - Legend Deviation from Baseline title could specify units (percentage points)
