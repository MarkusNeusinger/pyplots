review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with bimodal Treatment B demonstrating raincloud key advantage
    over box plots
  - All three raincloud elements (cloud, rain, box) properly positioned per specification
  - Clean visual layout with perfect text sizing, subtle grid, and improved yellow
    color (#E6A800)
  - Realistic reaction time data with appropriate scale (280-580ms) and meaningful
    context
  - Now uses sns.violinplot and sns.boxplot as requested in previous review
  - Added color legend as requested
  weaknesses:
  - Jittered points use manual ax.scatter instead of sns.stripplot which is the seaborn-native
    approach
  - Half-violin clipping uses matplotlib path manipulation; ptitprince library or
    native seaborn approach would be more idiomatic
