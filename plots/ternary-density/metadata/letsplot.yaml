review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary density using lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with
    polygon-based density rendering
  - Three clearly distinguishable density clusters demonstrate the plot analytical
    capability
  - Custom marching squares implementation for contour lines shows good algorithmic
    approach
  - Proper coordinate transformation from ternary to Cartesian space
  - Grid lines visible beneath density layer as specified
  - Uses perceptually uniform viridis colormap as recommended
  - Well-labeled vertices with clear component names
  - Clean publication-ready appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Contour lines (white dashed) could be slightly more prominent for easier interpretation
  - Legend could include a brief description or context for the density values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density visualization within an
    equilateral triangle. The three vertices are labeled "Sand" (bottom-left, blue
    text), "Silt" (bottom-right, blue text), and "Clay" (top, blue text). The density
    heatmap uses the viridis colormap, transitioning from dark purple (low density,
    ~1) through blue and green to bright yellow (high density, ~3). Three distinct
    density clusters are visible: one high-density yellow region near the Clay vertex
    (top), one yellow cluster in the lower-left portion representing sandy compositions,
    and one yellow-green cluster in the lower-right representing silty compositions.
    White dashed contour lines at 25%, 50%, and 75% density levels are visible, enhancing
    interpretation. Gray grid lines (at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% intervals) are visible
    beneath the density layer. The triangle outline is rendered in blue (#306998).
    A "Density" legend colorbar appears on the right side showing the scale from approximately
    1 to 3. The title "Sediment Composition · ternary-density · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in bold blue text.'
