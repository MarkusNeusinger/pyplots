review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data generation for 3 distinct clusters
  - Appropriate use of viridis colormap for the fourth dimension (energy)
  - Good axis labels with scientific units (nm, eV)
  - Title follows correct format specification
  - Reproducible with seed(42)
  weaknesses:
  - 'AR-05 VIOLATION: Seaborn has no native 3D scatter plot capability - uses matplotlib
    mplot3d for actual plotting with seaborn only providing styling (set_theme, set_context,
    color_palette) which is NOT sufficient per quality criteria'
  - Should be flagged as AR-06 (Not Feasible) - seaborn is fundamentally a 2D statistical
    visualization library and cannot create true 3D scatter plots
  - Implementation misleadingly claims to be a seaborn plot when it is actually a
    matplotlib 3D plot with seaborn styling
  - Z-axis label visibility is poor due to viewing angle
