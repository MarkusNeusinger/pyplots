review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adherence to sparkline minimalist design (no axes, labels, or gridlines)
  - Perfect aspect ratio (6:1) within the spec recommended 4:1 to 8:1 range
  - 'All optional features implemented: min/max highlights, first/last points, area
    fill'
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and proper output files (PNG and HTML)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive lets-plot features (e.g., tooltips in HTML version)
  - Data trend could be more dramatic to better showcase sparkline utility
