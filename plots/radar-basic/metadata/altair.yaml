review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using Altair layered composition and geoshape
    for the filled polygon
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear separation of data preparation and visualization
    layers
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of transparency (0.25) for the filled area as recommended in spec
  - Well-positioned labels outside the chart boundary with appropriate offset
  - Includes interactive tooltips showing category and score on hover
  - Grid hexagons properly closed and matching the 6-axis layout
  weaknesses:
  - Only shows single series when spec allows 1-3 series for comparison
  - Value range (70-90) is somewhat narrow; wider spread would better demonstrate
    strengths and weaknesses
