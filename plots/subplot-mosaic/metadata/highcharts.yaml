review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent mosaic layout implementation using CSS Grid with AAB/AAB/CCC pattern
  - Clean visual hierarchy with larger panel A dominating, supporting panels B and
    C
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette across all panels
  - Descriptive axis labels with units
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario
  - Proper title format and overall professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legends in Panel A and C are quite small and could be larger for better visibility
  - Could use Highcharts built-in dashboard/synchronized chart features for more native
    implementation
