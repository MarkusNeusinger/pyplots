review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color palette that is colorblind-accessible (blue, yellow, purple, green)
  - Clean layout with proper margins and well-positioned legend
  - Good use of hovertemplate for interactive exploration in HTML output
  - White marker borders provide visual distinction for overlapping points
  - Realistic business context (regional product performance)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is perhaps too subtle; 0.2-0.3 would provide better reference
    without being distracting
  - Legend border is minimal but could be removed entirely for cleaner look
  - Some sales growth values exceed 100% which is mathematically possible but unusual
