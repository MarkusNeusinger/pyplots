review:
  strengths: []
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned slightly far from the chart, creating some visual disconnect
  - Inner ring labels could use a slightly larger font for better prominence at full
    resolution
  - Could include percentage values alongside dollar amounts to better show part-to-whole
    relationships
