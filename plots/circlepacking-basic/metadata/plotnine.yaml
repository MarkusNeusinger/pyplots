review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to draw circles as polygons in plotnine
  - Clean color scheme using Python branding colors (blue/yellow) with good contrast
  - Well-implemented circle packing algorithm with tangent-based positioning
  - Good legend placement and correct title format
  - Realistic organizational structure data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - 'Team-level circles (yellow) all appear the same size despite having different
    values (Backend: 20, Frontend: 18, DevOps: 12) - the size variation is not visible'
  - Team labels (Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Finance, Legal, HR, Design, PM, Research)
    are not displayed - only department labels are shown
  - Uses helper functions instead of KISS flat script structure as recommended
