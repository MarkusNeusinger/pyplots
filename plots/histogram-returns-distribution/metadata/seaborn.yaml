review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: histogram with density, normal
    overlay, statistics box, and tail highlighting'
  - Clean separation of tail and non-tail data with visually distinct colors
  - Statistics text box is well-formatted and positioned
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Good use of seaborn histplot with density normalization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper left partially overlaps with the leftmost tail bar
  - The random data generation produces some unusually tall single-bar spikes in the
    tails that do not represent typical fat-tail behavior in financial returns
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns (in percentage)
    with density on the y-axis. The main histogram bars are rendered in a muted blue
    color (#306998) with 70% opacity, representing the "Returns" data within the ±2σ
    range. Yellow/golden bars (#FFD43B) highlight the tail regions beyond 2 standard
    deviations on both sides. Two vertical dashed gray lines mark the ±2σ boundaries
    (approximately at -2.85% and +2.94%). A red normal distribution curve is overlaid,
    showing the theoretical distribution fitted to the data. The x-axis ranges from
    approximately -4% to +6%, and the y-axis (Density) ranges from 0 to about 1.05.
    A statistics text box in the upper right corner displays: Mean: 0.044%, Std Dev:
    1.448%, Skewness: 0.300, Kurtosis: 0.580. The legend in the upper left shows three
    items: Normal distribution (red line), Returns (blue), and Tail regions (>2σ)
    (yellow). The title follows the required format: "histogram-returns-distribution
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background.'

        comment: Uses seaborn histplot with stat=density and sns.set_context(), but
          could leverage kdeplot or other seaborn-specific features more
