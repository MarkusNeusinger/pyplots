review:
  strengths:
  - Correct maze generation algorithm using Kruskal's algorithm to ensure single solution
  - Clear entry (blue arrow) and goal (red star) markers with good color contrast
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  - Generates multiple output formats (PNG, SVG, HTML)
  weaknesses:
  - Maze walls appear disconnected and jagged - each wall segment is drawn as a separate
    series creating visual discontinuities
  - The arc segments don't connect smoothly to form cohesive corridors
  - Wall thickness inconsistency between arcs and radial lines creates visual confusion
  - The maze structure is difficult to trace visually for solving
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze pattern with 6 concentric rings
    divided into 10 sectors. The maze structure consists of black line segments forming
    radial and circumferential walls on a white background. At the center is a red
    5-pointed star marking the goal. On the outer right edge, there is a blue arrow
    pointing inward indicating the entry point. The title "maze-circular · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The visualization uses pygal's XY chart to draw
    line segments representing the maze walls. However, the walls appear disconnected
    and jagged rather than forming smooth, connected corridors - this is a fundamental
    issue with the maze rendering approach.
