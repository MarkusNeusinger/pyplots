review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the feature importance bar chart with proper sorting
    (highest at top)
  - Clear gradient color mapping that visually emphasizes feature importance levels
  - Data labels positioned cleanly at the end of each bar for precise value reading
  - Realistic house price prediction scenario with meaningful feature names
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Clean, professional appearance suitable for publication
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are overly dense (increments of 0.005 create visual clutter)
  - Contains a helper function importance_to_color() which deviates slightly from
    KISS structure
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library as recommended in library rules
  - Error bars not included despite spec mentioning them as valuable for ensemble
    methods
