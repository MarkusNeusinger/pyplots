review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (x/y/size, transparency, size
    legend, correct title format)
  - 'Excellent code quality: clean KISS structure, reproducible seed, idiomatic Altair
    usage with declarative encoding'
  - Well-chosen realistic data context (tech startups) with appropriate value ranges
  - Explicitly set font sizes at all levels ensure text legibility at output resolution
  - White stroke on bubbles aids visual separation of overlapping elements
  weaknesses:
  - Data distribution is heavily right-skewed (lognormal), causing most bubbles to
    cluster in the lower-left quadrant while the upper-right has only a few sparse
    outliers — a more spread-out distribution or log-scale axis would improve visual
    balance
  - Design lacks visual sophistication to reach publication quality — consider adding
    color as a fourth dimension (e.g., categorical grouping or continuous gradient),
    custom color palette, or background styling
  - No explicit data storytelling through visual hierarchy — highlighting notable
    data points or adding subtle reference lines could guide the viewer to insights
  - The size legend starts at 0 employees which is unrealistic given the data minimum
    is 20 — adjusting legend range would improve accuracy

  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with "Funding ($M)" on the x-axis
    (range 0–54) and "Revenue ($M)" on the y-axis (range 0–80). Bubble sizes represent
    "Employees" (0–800) as shown by a size legend in the upper-right corner. All bubbles
    are Python Blue (#306998) with white stroke borders and approximately 0.6 opacity.
    The data depicts 40 tech startups, showing a positive correlation between funding
    and revenue, with larger companies (more employees) clustering in the upper-right
    quadrant. The title reads "bubble-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" centered at the
    top. The grid is very subtle (low opacity). Data is heavily clustered in the lower-left
    (funding < $25M) with only 3–4 high-value outliers spread across the $38–54M funding
    range, leaving noticeable empty space in the middle-right portion of the chart.
