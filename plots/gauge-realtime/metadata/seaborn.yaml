review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent motion blur effect showing needle transition history for real-time indication
  - Clear and intuitive green/yellow/red color zones following conventional meaning
  - Prominent numeric display of current value (67%) with appropriate sizing
  - Clean implementation with proper LIVE indicator enhancing real-time feel
  - Good use of alpha blending for motion blur effect
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn library features are minimally used (only sns.set_theme) - gauge is built
    with matplotlib patches
  - Motion blur needle positions could have slightly higher opacity for better visibility
    of the transition effect
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart representing CPU
    usage at 67%. The gauge has three color zones: green (0-50) for normal range,
    yellow (50-80) for warning, and red (80-100) for critical. A dark blue needle
    points to the current value, with motion blur effect showing three previous needle
    positions (52, 58, 63) in lighter opacity to indicate real-time updating. The
    gauge has tick marks at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 with bold labels. The current value
    "67%" is prominently displayed below the gauge center in large blue text. A "LIVE"
    indicator with a red dot appears in the upper right, indicating real-time nature.
    The title "gauge-realtime · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Min
    (0%) and max (100%) labels appear at gauge boundaries. "CPU Usage" label is shown
    below the numeric value.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme() for styling, but gauge is primarily matplotlib
          patches/manual drawing. Seaborn's distinctive features like statistical
          plots are not applicable here.
