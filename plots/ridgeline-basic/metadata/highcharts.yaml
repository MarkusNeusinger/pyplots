review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme that smoothly transitions from cool winter blues to warm
    summer yellows/oranges, enhancing data interpretation
  - Proper implementation of ridgeline concept using Highcharts area series with threshold
    baselines for clean ridge separation
  - Realistic temperature distribution data that clearly demonstrates seasonal patterns
  - Gradient fills with transparency create visually appealing overlap effect
  - Clean y-axis labeling using JavaScript formatter to display month names at correct
    vertical positions
  - Produces both static PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Highcharts web
    capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (kde) which deviates slightly from KISS structure,
    though justified by library limitations
  - Grid lines extend fully across the plot area - could be more subtle or limited
    to below the ridges
  - Right margin appears slightly larger than necessary, creating minor layout asymmetry
