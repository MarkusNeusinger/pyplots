  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution in Online group showcasing violin
    plot capability
  - Clean embedded box plots with visible median, quartiles, and whiskers
  - Mean lines (red) add extra statistical information beyond spec requirements
  - Realistic education scenario with plausible test score distributions
  - Proper output sizing (4800x2700) with readable fonts
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 makes gridlines very faint; could use 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - Outlier markers are small (size 8); increasing to 10-12 would improve visibility
  - Yellow color for Interactive group may have reduced contrast for some colorblind
    users
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots with embedded box plots,
    comparing test scores across four teaching methods: Traditional (blue), Interactive
    (yellow), Online (light blue), and Hybrid (pink). Each violin shows the kernel
    density estimate (KDE) of the distribution with a white box plot embedded inside
    showing median, quartiles, and whiskers. The title "violin-box · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top in black text. The y-axis shows "Test Score (points)" ranging
    from 0 to ~105, and the x-axis shows "Teaching Method" with the four category
    labels. The background is clean white with subtle horizontal gridlines. Outliers
    are visible as small dots (one below Traditional around 30, one below Hybrid around
    27). The Online group shows a bimodal distribution shape. Mean lines (red) are
    visible within each violin.'
