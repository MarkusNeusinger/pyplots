review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent financial dashboard example perfectly demonstrating the subplot-grid
    concept with four distinct but related visualizations
  - 'Creative color encoding: volume bars colored by return sign, scatter colored
    by return value'
  - Moving average overlay adds depth to the price chart
  - Statistical annotations (mean, zero line) in histogram enhance educational value
  - Clean, professional appearance with consistent styling across all subplots
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes slightly below recommended guidelines (titles 18pt vs 24pt, labels
    16pt vs 20pt)
  - Legend fontsize could be larger for better readability (12-14 vs 16)
