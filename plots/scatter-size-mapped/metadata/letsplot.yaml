review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the bubble chart concept with clear three-dimensional
    data encoding (position + size + color)
  - Realistic synthetic data generation with regional patterns that reflect real-world
    economic correlations
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility via random seed
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features present (transparency, size
    legend, color mapping, units)
  - Very readable text at all sizes and good use of colorblind-safe palette
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like interactive tooltips or
    hover information that would enhance the bubble chart exploration
  - Grid styling could be improved (currently dashed lines, solid subtle lines might
    be cleaner)
