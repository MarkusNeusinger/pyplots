review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with properly sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic educational data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that is immediately
    relatable
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility via seed
  - Good use of hovertemplate for interactive tooltips
  - Appropriate marker transparency (0.7) for showing overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha is 0.1 which is quite faint - could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3
    recommended)
  - Does not fully leverage Plotly distinctive interactive features beyond basic hover
  - Data could include a few more obvious outliers to better demonstrate scatter plot
    use cases
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 100 data points showing
    the relationship between Study Hours (x-axis, ranging from 1-10) and Exam Score
    in percentage (y-axis, ranging from ~40-100). Points are rendered in a muted blue
    color (#306998) with moderate transparency (0.7 opacity). The title "scatter-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Both axes have clear labels with
    units ("Study Hours (h)" and "Exam Score (%)"). The background is clean white
    with subtle gray gridlines. The data shows a clear positive correlation - as study
    hours increase, exam scores tend to increase, with natural scatter/noise around
    the trend.
