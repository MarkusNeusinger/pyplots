review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_step with hv direction parameter creating proper stair-step
    visualization
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation with proper layering (step + points)
  - Perfect title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good color choices with Python blue and yellow for brand consistency
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 output with scaled export
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that matches spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses dashed lines which can appear busy; solid subtle lines may be
    cleaner
  - Markers could be slightly larger (size=6-7) for better visibility at the data
    points
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart showing cumulative monthly sales
    data over 12 months. A dark blue (#306998) step line creates a clear stair-step
    pattern ascending from approximately $45K in month 1 to $822K in month 12. Bright
    yellow (#FFD43B) circular markers highlight each data point where changes occur.
    The title "step-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The x-axis
    is labeled "Month" with ticks from 1-12, and the y-axis is labeled "Cumulative
    Sales ($K)" ranging from 50 to 850. A subtle gray dashed grid aids value reading.
    The plot fills the canvas well with balanced proportions.
