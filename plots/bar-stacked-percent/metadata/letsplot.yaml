review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of position=fill for proper 100% stacking normalization
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between energy sources
  - Real-world data scenario (European energy mix) that demonstrates meaningful proportional
    differences
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper categorical ordering ensures consistent stacking across all bars
  - Good text sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current default may be slightly prominent)
  - Could add percentage labels inside segments for larger portions to enhance readability
