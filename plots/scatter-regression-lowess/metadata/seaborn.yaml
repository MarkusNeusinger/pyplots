  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn regplot with lowess=True for the canonical LOWESS implementation
  - Strong color contrast between blue scatter points and yellow LOWESS curve makes
    the regression line very visible
  - Appropriate marker size and transparency for 200 data points
  - Well-structured synthetic data that demonstrates the LOWESS curve adapting to
    non-linear patterns
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual
  - The synthetic data could show more distinct local variations to better demonstrate
    LOWESS local-fitting capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with LOWESS regression on a
    16:9 canvas. Blue scatter points (#306998) with alpha 0.6 are distributed showing
    a complex non-linear relationship - relatively flat oscillation from x=0-5, then
    rising steeply from x=5-10. A bright yellow/gold LOWESS curve (#FFD43B) with linewidth
    4 smoothly traces through the data, capturing the non-linear trend. The title
    "scatter-regression-lowess · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is at the top. Axis labels
    are "X Value" and "Y Value" in large font. A subtle dashed grid with alpha 0.3
    provides reference. The plot uses good space, with balanced margins.

        comment: Shows non-linear relationship with varying patterns across x-range.
          The sine+power combination demonstrates LOWESS ability to adapt, though
          the relationship could show more distinct local variation.
