review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of filled contour using Highcharts heatmap with
    overlaid line series for contour lines
  - 'Creative solution: white contour lines with black shadow for visibility against
    any background color'
  - Colorblind-safe viridis colormap implementation with proper color stops
  - High-quality 4800x2700 resolution with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Contour level annotations (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%) provide precise reference
    points
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations API for contour labels
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure includes helper functions (marching_squares_contour, connect_segments)
    which violates the KISS principle - should be flat script structure
  - Colorbar/legend takes significant right margin space; could be more compact
  image_description: The plot displays a filled contour visualization showing a 2D
    scalar field with multiple Gaussian peaks. The colormap uses viridis (colorblind-safe),
    ranging from dark purple (~0%) through teal/green (~50%) to bright yellow (~100%).
    The plot has a clear title "contour-filled · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top.
    X and Y axes are labeled "X Position (units)" and "Y Position (units)" respectively,
    ranging from -4.0 to 4.0. White contour lines with black shadows are overlaid
    on the heatmap for precise level identification. Contour level labels (10%, 30%,
    50%, 70%, 90%) are shown with white backgrounds. A vertical colorbar on the right
    shows "Intensity (%)" from 0% to 100%. The plot shows three main high-intensity
    peaks (yellow regions) and one low-intensity valley (dark purple region), demonstrating
    the multi-Gaussian surface effectively.
