review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex alluvial diagram using Altairs declarative
    grammar
  - Creative use of mark_line with filled=True and order encoding to render flow polygons
  - Smooth curve interpolation using smoothstep function for visually appealing flow
    bands
  - Well-designed colorblind-accessible color scheme (Python blue, yellow, green,
    purple)
  - Proper layer composition with flows, nodes, node labels, and time labels clearly
    separated
  - Interactive features enabled with .interactive() and comprehensive tooltips on
    nodes
  - Good transparency (0.5 opacity) on flows allowing visual tracking of crossing
    streams
  - Realistic voter migration data demonstrating all features of alluvial diagrams
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels are abbreviated (Con, Lib, Prog, Ind) which slightly reduces immediate
    comprehension; full names would be preferable if space permits
