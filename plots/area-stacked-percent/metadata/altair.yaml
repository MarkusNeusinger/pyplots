review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with stack="normalize" for proper
    100% stacking
  - Clear, compelling real-world narrative (energy transition) that perfectly demonstrates
    the spec
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized long-format
    data
  - Good typography sizing making all text highly readable
  - Appropriate use of tooltips and interactive HTML export
  - Proper stacking order using explicit order encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned outside creates slight whitespace imbalance; consider moving
    inside plot area
  - Nuclear data staying perfectly flat at 12% for all 10 years feels artificially
    constant
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked area chart showing energy source
    mix evolution from 2015 to 2024. Four colored areas are stacked from bottom to
    top: Coal (steel blue), Natural Gas (golden yellow), Nuclear (medium slate blue/purple),
    and Renewables (sea green). The Y-axis shows "Share of Energy Mix (%)" ranging
    from 0% to 100% with percentage formatting. The X-axis displays years from 2015
    to 2024. The title "area-stacked-percent · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top. A legend on the right identifies the four energy sources with colored
    circular markers. The chart clearly illustrates the energy transition narrative
    with Coal declining from ~45% to ~16%, Renewables growing from ~18% to ~44%, while
    Natural Gas and Nuclear remain relatively stable. Subtle dashed grid lines provide
    reference. The areas have slight transparency (0.85 opacity) with visible boundary
    lines.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding with proper stacking (`stack="normalize"`),
          tooltips, and `interactive()` for HTML export. However, could leverage more
          Altair-specific features like selections or more sophisticated interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
