review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of quiver plot in Altair which does not have native arrow
    support
  - Creative solution using rule marks for arrow shafts and arrowheads
  - Good use of viridis colormap for magnitude encoding
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio with appropriate font sizes
  - Clear circular rotation pattern demonstrating vector field concept
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for abstract mathematical coordinates, this is
    acceptable)
  - Grid is slightly too subtle at alpha 0.3
  - Arrowheads at center (low magnitude vectors) are very small and harder to see
  - No tooltips or interactivity despite Altair strength in this area
