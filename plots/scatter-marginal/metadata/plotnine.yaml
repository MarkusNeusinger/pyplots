review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine composition API with | and / operators for arranging
    multiple plots
  - Clean, realistic dataset showing study hours vs exam score correlation
  - Proper axis alignment between scatter plot and marginal histograms
  - Good color contrast between blue scatter/top histogram and yellow right histogram
  - Correct title format and well-labeled axes with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling inconsistent between main scatter plot and marginal histograms
  - Top-right spacer creates slight visual imbalance in the layout
