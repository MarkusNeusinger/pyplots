review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polynomial regression with R² and equation annotation
  - Beautiful visual design with Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) color
    scheme
  - Proper use of confidence band with 95% CI
  - Realistic diminishing returns scenario that matches spec applications
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in lower right slightly overlaps the data region where points exist
  - Uses numpy polyfit instead of seaborn regplot(order=2) which would be more library-idiomatic
  - Generic units for axis labels rather than specific units (e.g., dollars, percentage)
