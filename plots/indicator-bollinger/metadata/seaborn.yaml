review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes and line widths
  - Correct implementation of all Bollinger Bands components per specification
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility characteristics
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  - Good color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Upper and lower band lines lack labels in legend (appear as unlabeled line entries)
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features instead of matplotlib fill_between
  - Initial data point after rolling window creates a slight visual discontinuity
  image_description: The plot displays a Bollinger Bands technical indicator chart
    spanning approximately 5 months (August 2025 to December 2025). The close price
    is rendered as a dark navy/black solid line showing realistic stock price volatility
    starting around $147 and trending downward to around $137 with various fluctuations.
    The 20-day SMA (middle band) is displayed as a yellow dashed line that smoothly
    tracks the price movement. The Bollinger Bands envelope is visualized as a light
    blue semi-transparent filled area between the upper and lower bands, with solid
    blue lines marking the band boundaries. The bands appropriately widen during volatile
    periods and contract during consolidation. The title follows the correct format
    "indicator-bollinger · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axes are clearly labeled with "Date"
    (x-axis) and "Price ($)" (y-axis). A legend in the upper left identifies all three
    elements. The grid uses subtle dashed lines with appropriate alpha.
