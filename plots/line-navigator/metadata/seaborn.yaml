review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the navigator pattern with clear visual separation
    between detail and overview panels
  - Clean visual design with consistent Python blue color theme and subtle yellow
    selection highlight
  - Good use of GridSpec for precise layout control with appropriate 4:1 height ratio
  - Realistic sensor data with trend, seasonality, and noise components
  - Date range annotation provides clear context for the selected period
  weaknesses:
  - Navigator y-axis ticks removed but line appears slightly compressed; consider
    maintaining y-limits consistency
  - Grid styling could be improved - currently no legend but not strictly needed for
    single series
  image_description: 'The plot displays a two-panel visualization for a line chart
    with navigator. The main upper panel shows detailed sensor readings from February
    2023 to July 2023, with values ranging approximately 53-78 units. The line is
    rendered in Python blue (#306998) with clear oscillating patterns. A white text
    box in the upper right corner displays "Selected Range: 2023-02-05 to 2023-07-05".
    The lower navigator panel shows the full 3-year dataset (2022-01 to 2025-01) at
    reduced scale with gray shading outside the selected region. A yellow rectangular
    border highlights the selected time range, and vertical yellow lines mark the
    selection boundaries. The navigator uses the same blue line color with slight
    transparency. Text is legible with appropriate font sizes, and both panels share
    a clean, minimal aesthetic with subtle grid lines.'
