review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all four decomposition components with clear visual
    separation
  - Uses statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper statistical decomposition
  - Clean shared x-axis implementation using x_range linking
  - Appropriate font sizes for the 4800px canvas width
  - Classic airline passenger example with realistic trend and seasonal patterns
  - Good use of dashed grid lines that do not distract from the data
  weaknesses:
  - Bokeh toolbar visible on right side adds visual clutter; could be hidden for static
    export
  - Y-axis label rotation on Passengers (thousands) makes it slightly harder to read
  - Panel heights (620px each) leave some unused vertical space in 2700px target
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
  image_description: 'The plot displays four vertically stacked panels showing a time
    series decomposition of airline passenger data from 2018-2028. The main title
    "timeseries-decomposition · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. All panels
    use the Python blue color (#306998) for the line plots with dashed grid lines
    at 0.3 alpha.


    - **Original Series** (top): Shows the raw data with clear upward trend and seasonal
    fluctuations, ranging from ~80 to ~280 thousand passengers. Y-axis labeled "Passengers
    (thousands)".

    - **Trend Component**: Displays a smooth monotonically increasing line from ~110
    to ~240, capturing the long-term growth.

    - **Seasonal Component**: Shows a repeating sinusoidal pattern oscillating between
    approximately -30 and +30, with consistent annual cycles.

    - **Residual Component** (bottom): Shows random noise fluctuating around zero
    (approximately -20 to +20), with the x-axis labeled "Date".


    All panels share a linked x-axis from 2018 to 2028. The Bokeh toolbar is visible
    on the right side of each panel with interactive tools.'

        comment: Grid at 0.3 alpha with dashed style is subtle and appropriate; no
          legend needed for this plot type but the Bokeh toolbar is visible and somewhat
          distracting

        comment: Uses figure, line, column layout, x_range linking between panels,
          Title model, export_png - good Bokeh usage but could leverage ColumnDataSource
          and HoverTool for enhanced interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
