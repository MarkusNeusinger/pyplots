review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native Waterfall trace with measure types (absolute, relative,
    total)
  - Clean connector lines with dotted styling emphasize cumulative flow
  - 'Proper color differentiation: blue for totals, red for decreases, green for increases'
  - Value labels positioned outside bars with clear dollar formatting
  - Realistic financial scenario with appropriate data values
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    using blue/orange palette)
  - Could add a simple legend explaining the color meanings for clarity
