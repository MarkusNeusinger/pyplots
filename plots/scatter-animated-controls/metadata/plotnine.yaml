review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Gapminder-style data scenario with realistic country trajectories showing
    different regional growth patterns
  - Clean faceted layout that effectively communicates temporal evolution without
    animation
  - Good use of Dark2 colorblind-safe palette with appropriate alpha for point visibility
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with comprehensive theme customization
  - Proper use of scale_size_continuous with meaningful breaks for population encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Size legend shows three solid circles that appear similar in rendering - may not
    clearly show size differentiation
  - X-axis tick labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
