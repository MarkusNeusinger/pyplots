review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of standard meteorological wind barb notation with proper
    directional convention
  - Includes helpful wind barb legend annotation explaining the symbology
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing U, V components and wind speed at each station
  - Clean spatial layout with 60 weather stations in a realistic grid pattern
  - 'Demonstrates all wind conditions: calm (circles), moderate (barbs), and strong
    winds'
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a function (draw_wind_barb) instead of inline code, violating KISS principle
  - Pennants (50 kt triangles) for strong winds are not visually distinctive - they
    appear similar to regular barbs
  - Wind barb line width could be thicker for better visibility at high resolution
  - X-axis range extends unnecessarily beyond data (-2 to 11 when data is 0-9)
  image_description: The plot displays a grid of wind barbs across a 10x6 coordinate
    system representing weather station locations. The barbs are rendered in a dark
    blue color (#306998) on a white background with a light gray grid. Each wind barb
    shows a staff pointing in the direction from which wind blows, with varying numbers
    of full barbs (10 knots each) and half barbs (5 knots) attached. Calm wind conditions
    (<2.5 kt) are shown as open circles at positions (0,0), (5,2), and (5,4). The
    plot includes proper axis labels showing 'Longitude (°E)' and 'Latitude (°N)'.
    A legend box in the upper-left shows 'Weather Stations' and another annotation
    box in the lower-right explains the wind barb notation (calm, half barb, full
    barb, pennant). The title follows the required format 'windbarb-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai'.
