review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a Venn diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics
    approach
  - Clean, readable layout with well-positioned count labels in each region
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.45) to show overlap regions clearly
  - Realistic tech team scenario with mathematically consistent intersection counts
  - Proper calculation of exclusive region counts from set totals and intersections
  - Clean theme with hidden axes and grid appropriate for a Venn diagram
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two of the three colors are shades of blue (#306998 and #4B8BBE), which could
    be confusing for colorblind users'
  - Figure size is 12x12 (square) instead of 16x9 as recommended in library guidelines
