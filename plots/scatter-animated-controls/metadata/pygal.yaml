review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style visualization with proper size encoding
    via node radius
  - Year watermark (2021) clearly indicates the time point shown in the static preview
  - Interactive HTML version with slider controls matches the spec animation requirement
    perfectly
  - Clean color scheme with good colorblind accessibility
  - Proper use of pygal Style system for consistent large-canvas formatting
  - Comprehensive tooltips showing country name, GDP, life expectancy, and population
  weaknesses:
  - Legend marker squares at the bottom are too small/barely visible - the colored
    indicator dots should be larger for better readability
  - Some of the smaller data points (particularly the tiny ones for Region 3) could
    benefit from slightly larger minimum sizes
