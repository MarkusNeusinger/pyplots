review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of hive plot using pygal XY chart capabilities
  - Excellent use of Bézier curves for edges with appropriate curvature based on axis
    crossing
  - Good color scheme with semi-transparent edges to handle density
  - Well-structured realistic software module dependency data
  - Clean code with good canvas utilization (3600x3600 square format)
  - Properly generates both PNG and interactive HTML/SVG outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Axis endpoint labels (Core, Utility, Interface) only appear in legend, not directly
    on the plot near axis endpoints
  - Node labels are somewhat small and could be more prominent for better readability
