review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with clean, readable code structure
  - Proper quartile lines (25th, 50th, 75th percentile) clearly visible inside each
    violin as required by spec
  - Realistic salary distribution data that tells a coherent story (Engineering highest,
    Sales widest spread)
  - Good color choice with sufficient alpha for visibility
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output using ggsize(1600,900) with scale=3
  - Clean minimal theme that does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (minor formatting issue)
  - Color palette only uses 2 alternating colors for 4 categories which could cause
    confusion about category groupings
  - Star import (from lets_plot import *) is functional but less explicit than named
    imports
