review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-layer visualization with clear contrast between raw data and rolling
    average
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that effectively demonstrates the rolling
    average smoothing effect
  - Proper use of alpha transparency for raw data line making the rolling average
    prominent
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Well-formatted date axis with appropriate rotation for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Raw data line could be slightly thinner (linewidth=1 instead of 1.5) for even
    better contrast with rolling average
  - Consider adding a subtle shaded region between raw and rolling average to emphasize
    the smoothing effect
