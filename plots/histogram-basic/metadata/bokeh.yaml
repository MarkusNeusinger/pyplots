review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with bimodal distribution annotations, median/mean
    lines, and descriptive subtitle
  - 'Strong use of Bokeh-specific features: linear_cmap color gradient, HoverTool,
    ColumnDataSource, formal Legend model'
  - Publication-quality typography hierarchy with explicitly set font sizes at multiple
    tiers
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed spines, subtle grid, white bar separators, well-balanced
    color palette'
  - Realistic marathon finish time scenario with appropriate data generation showing
    multimodal distribution
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in far top-right corner is somewhat isolated from the data area;
    positioning it closer to the main distribution would improve layout balance
  - Code is slightly verbose in the Legend model construction and slower_bin_idx calculation
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of marathon finish times using
    28 bins spanning approximately 120-420 minutes. Bars are colored with a blue gradient
    via Bokeh's linear_cmap — darker blues for higher counts, lighter blues for lower
    counts. A solid red vertical line marks the median (~251 min) and a dashed teal
    vertical line marks the mean (~259 min), both annotated in a legend in the top-right
    corner. Two bold text annotations with downward-pointing triangles label the "Main
    group (~4 hr pace)" peak region and the "Slower group (~5 hr pace)" secondary
    mode. A subtitle reads "N = 500 runners | Right-skewed bimodal distribution".
    The x-axis is labeled "Finish Time (min)" and the y-axis "Number of Runners".
    The title reads "histogram-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai". The background is clean
    white with no x-grid and a very subtle y-grid. Y-axis starts at 0. The bimodal
    structure is clearly visible with a dominant peak around 240-250 min, a secondary
    bump around 295-310 min, and an outlier tail extending past 370 min.
