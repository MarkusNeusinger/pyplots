review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color palette (steel blue to cream to gold) with well-chosen
    midpoint at 0, creating an intuitive visual encoding of positive/negative growth
  - Conditional text color logic (white on dark, dark gray on mid, dark brown on gold)
    ensures all annotations are readable against their cell background
  - Data tells a compelling recovery story with intentional extreme values (HR -32.5
    crisis, Sales +38.2 surge) serving as visual focal points
  - Clean, idiomatic plotnine code with vectorized data generation and meshgrid-based
    long-form DataFrame construction
  - 'Fully polished theme: removed grid lines, custom background, generous margins,
    rotated tick labels'
  weaknesses:
  - The colorbar legend could benefit from more tick marks to better communicate the
    full range of the scale
  - Minor wasted horizontal space on the right side between the plot and the legend
    area
  image_description: 'The heatmap displays an 8x8 grid of quarterly growth rates (%)
    across 8 departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR,
    Research, Support) over 8 quarters (Q1 ''23 through Q4 ''24). A diverging color
    scheme is used: dark steel blue for strongly negative values, cream/beige for
    near-zero values, and gold/amber for strongly positive values. Each cell contains
    a bold, signed numeric annotation (e.g., "+38.2", "-32.5"). Text color adapts
    to background: white on dark blue cells, dark gray on mid-range cells, and dark
    brown on gold cells. The title "Quarterly Growth by Department · heatmap-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered and bold at the top, with a subtitle describing
    the data. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees showing quarter names, Y-axis shows
    department names. A vertical colorbar legend labeled "Growth (%)" appears on the
    right with a range from approximately -20 to 40. White borders separate cells
    cleanly. The background is light gray (#f7f7f7). The plot clearly shows a recovery
    narrative from left (negative) to right (positive).'
