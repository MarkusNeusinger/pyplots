review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of adjustText library for automatic label positioning with subtle
    connecting lines
  - Proper seaborn theming with whitegrid and colorblind palette
  - Text sizes optimized for the 4800x2700 resolution
  - Realistic tech company scenario matching spec application examples
  - Good marker sizing (s=200) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (consider reducing grid alpha or using a lighter
    style)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter visualization of 15 technology companies
    with Annual Revenue ($ Billion) on the X-axis (0-80) and Market Capitalization
    ($ Billion) on the Y-axis (~25-350). Each blue data point (with white edge) represents
    a company and has a text label annotation connected by subtle gray lines. The
    labels include company names like VirtualAI, CloudNet, DataSys, QuantumX, CodeBase,
    AILabs, DevOps, TechCorp, NetFlow, SecureIT, CyberSec, SmartHub, ByteLogic, AppWorks,
    and StreamIO. The title follows the correct format "scatter-annotated · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". The plot uses a clean whitegrid background with subtle blue gridlines.
    Labels are well-distributed using adjustText, with minimal overlap visible.

        comment: Uses seaborn scatterplot with DataFrame and set_theme, but the annotation
          work is done via matplotlib text and adjustText rather than seaborn-specific
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
