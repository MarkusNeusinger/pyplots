review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data quality with realistic, neutral technology items placed in plausible
    time-horizon rings and sectors
  - 'Strong visual design: ring background fills, colored sector headers matching
    markers, size encoding by importance creates effective visual hierarchy'
  - Complete spec compliance — all required features implemented including 270° layout,
    distinct marker shapes, collision mitigation, and comprehensive dual-section legend
  - Clean, well-structured code with good configuration separation and deterministic
    seed
  weaknesses:
  - Several label overlaps persist despite collision mitigation — particularly Phage
    Therapy/Longevity Biomarkers, the Cloud & Infra outer ring area where Serverless
    GPUs appears hidden, and crowding around Biocomputing/Organ-on-Chip
  - Item label font size (10pt) is too small for a 3600x3600 canvas — should be increased
    to 11-12pt for better readability at full resolution
  - Title font size (22pt) falls below the 24pt minimum guideline
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib for the core visualization (polar projection, annotations,
    ring fills, legend) limits seaborn contribution to mainly the scatterplot call
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree polar/radar chart titled "radar-innovation-timeline
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top in large bold text. Four concentric rings represent
    time horizons (inner to outer: Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold), each with a subtle
    background fill — green for Adopt, light orange for Trial, yellow for Assess,
    and light red for Hold. Gray boundary circles separate the rings, and gray radial
    lines divide the chart into 4 angular sectors. Sector headers are displayed in
    bold colored text near the outer edge: "Sustainability" (green, upper-left), "Cloud
    & Infra" (orange, upper-right), "AI & ML" (blue, right), and "Biotech" (purple,
    lower-left). Each sector uses distinct marker shapes — circles (AI & ML), squares
    (Cloud & Infra), diamonds (Sustainability), and triangles (Biotech) — all color-coded
    to match sector headers. Marker sizes vary by ring importance (larger for Adopt,
    smaller for Hold). 27 innovation items are labeled with white-background text
    boxes. A legend in the lower-right corner shows sector markers/colors and ring
    size explanations. Some label overlaps are visible, particularly in the Biotech/Sustainability
    area ("Phage Therapy"/"Longevity Biomarkers", "Biocomputing"/"Organ-on-Chip")
    and the Cloud & Infra outer ring where "Serverless GPUs" label appears hidden
    behind "RISC-V Servers".'
