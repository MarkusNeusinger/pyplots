review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of classic wind rose visualization with proper compass
    orientation (N at top, clockwise)
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette with good visual separation between
    stacked segments
  - Appropriate use of square aspect ratio for radial chart
  - Clear data story showing prevailing winds from W direction with realistic stacked
    speed categories
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside plot area could be better integrated (consider inside
    upper portion)
  - Radial labels (percentage) could include units in ylabel or subtitle for complete
    context
  - The figsize of 12x12 may not match the expected 3600x3600 at 300dpi (would be
    3600x3600 but library guidelines suggest 16x9)
  image_description: 'The polar bar chart displays wind direction frequency data in
    a classic wind rose format. The chart features 8 compass directions (N, NE, E,
    SE, S, SW, W, NW) arranged radially with North at the top. Bars extend outward
    from the center with three stacked color segments: deep blue (#306998) for "Calm
    (0-5 m/s)", golden yellow (#FFD43B) for "Moderate (5-10 m/s)", and turquoise (#4ECDC4)
    for "Strong (>10 m/s)". The W direction shows the highest total frequency (~45%),
    while SE shows the lowest (~12%). Radial grid lines mark 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%
    levels. The title "polar-bar · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold. A legend with "Wind Speed" title is positioned in the upper right outside
    the plot area. The overall layout uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with good canvas
    utilization.'

        comment: Radial labels show "10%", "20%", etc. which is descriptive but compass
          directions are the categorical axis (no units needed)

        comment: Uses matplotlib's polar projection, theta_zero_location, theta_direction,
          rlabel_position - good use of polar-specific features but nothing exceptional
  verdict: APPROVED
