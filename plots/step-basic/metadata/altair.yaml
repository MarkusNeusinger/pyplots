quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step-after interpolation creating proper stair-step
    pattern
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate font sizes and good canvas utilization
  - Markers at data points clearly highlight where changes occur (as recommended in
    spec)
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that demonstrates practical step chart usage
  - Proper use of Altair declarative encoding with N (nominal) and Q (quantitative)
    types
  weaknesses:
  - Could add tooltips for enhanced interactivity since Altair excels at this
  - Grid styling could be slightly more refined (gridDash appears somewhat prominent)
