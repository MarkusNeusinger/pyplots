review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative approach to demonstrating interactive concepts in a static
    library through annotations (tooltip box, zoom region highlight)
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with daily/weekly patterns and anomaly spikes
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geoms
  - Clean datetime formatting on x-axis with appropriate rotation
  - Well-designed color scheme for the main data elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the final rendered image despite being coded - needs
    investigation/fix
  - The code structure is complex with multiple DataFrames; could be simplified
  - Scatter points could be larger for better visibility on the 4800x2700 canvas
