review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stacking implementation using Bokeh varea with proper cumulative calculations
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource pattern for each layer
  - Well-styled legend with appropriate font sizes and spacing for high-resolution
    output
  - Realistic e-commerce revenue scenario with meaningful trends and seasonality
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good canvas utilization with 4800x2700 dimensions
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow color shades for Clothing and Sports are similar in luminance, making them
    harder to distinguish
  - Missing HoverTool which is a distinctive Bokeh feature for interactivity
  - Series not strictly ordered by size (largest at bottom) as suggested in spec Notes
