review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear clade-based color coding throughout branches
    and labels
  - Biologically accurate evolutionary distance matrix for primate species
  - Professional typography with proper font sizes and weights for all text elements
  - Thoughtful color palette using distinct, colorblind-safe colors for 5 clades
  - Clean layout with appropriate use of seaborn aesthetic styling
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (get_link_color) which violates KISS principle - inline
    logic preferred
  - Title format includes Primate Evolution prefix before spec-id which deviates from
    standard format
