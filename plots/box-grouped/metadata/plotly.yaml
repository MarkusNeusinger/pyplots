review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color palette choice (blue/yellow/teal) that is both visually appealing
    and colorblind-accessible
  - Clean data structure with realistic employee performance scenario across departments
    and experience levels
  - 'Properly implements all box plot features: median line, quartile boxes, whiskers,
    and outliers with boxpoints=outliers'
  - Font sizes are well-calibrated for 4800x2700 resolution with title at 32pt, labels
    at 24pt, ticks at 20pt
  - Good use of plotly_white template for clean professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be Performance Score (0-100) to clarify the scale)
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive features like custom hover templates showing
    exact statistics
  - Some outliers exceed 100, which is unusual for a 0-100 performance score scale
