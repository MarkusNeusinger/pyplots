review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features including HoverTool with informative
    tooltips showing scientific names
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate color scheme (Python blue/yellow)
  - Well-structured clade annotations with italic styling for taxonomic names
  - Scale bar properly indicates evolutionary distance units
  - Comprehensive legend explaining node types
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in far top-right corner could be closer to the tree for better
    visual association
  - Title format includes descriptive prefix instead of strictly following spec-id
    format
