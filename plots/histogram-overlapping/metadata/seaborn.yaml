review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen transparency (alpha=0.5) that reveals
    overlapping distribution regions
  - Realistic business context (employee response times by department) with appropriate
    data characteristics
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes, subtle grid, and well-positioned
    legend
  weaknesses:
  - Bins are calculated independently for each histogram rather than being explicitly
    aligned across all groups (spec recommends aligned bin edges)
  - Could use more idiomatic seaborn approach with DataFrame and hue parameter instead
    of three separate histplot calls
