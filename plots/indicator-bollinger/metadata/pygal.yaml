review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Bollinger Bands calculation with 20-period SMA and 2
    standard deviations
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for appropriate font sizes and colors
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  - Appropriate handling of None values for initial periods before SMA can be calculated
  - Dashed line style for SMA distinguishes it from price and bands
  - Realistic stock price simulation with trend and volatility
  weaknesses:
  - Upper and lower bands use identical light blue color (#7EB3D4), making them harder
    to distinguish visually
  - Missing semi-transparent fill between upper and lower bands as specified in the
    spec
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent and could be more subtle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bollinger Bands chart for 120 trading days.
    The chart has a white background with a clear title "indicator-bollinger · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging from approximately
    126 to 164, and the X-axis shows "Trading Day" with labels at Day 1, Day 21, Day
    41, Day 61, Day 81, and Day 101. Four line series are displayed: (1) Close Price
    in dark blue showing the actual stock price with significant volatility, (2) SMA
    (20) in yellow/gold dashed line showing the 20-period moving average, (3) Upper
    Band in light blue showing the upper Bollinger Band, and (4) Lower Band in light
    blue showing the lower Bollinger Band. The legend is positioned at the bottom
    with all four series clearly labeled. The price data shows a downtrend from ~$156
    to ~$127 over the first 60 days, followed by a consolidation/slight recovery phase.
    The bands appropriately widen during volatile periods and narrow during consolidation.'
