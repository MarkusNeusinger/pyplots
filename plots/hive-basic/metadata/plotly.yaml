review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent software module dependency network scenario that makes the hive plot
    concept immediately understandable
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/cyan) with good visual distinction
  - Proper bezier curve implementation for edges creates attractive bundled appearance
    through center
  - Node sizing by degree provides additional data encoding beyond axis position
  - Interactive HTML output with hover tooltips showing module name and degree
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with inline calculations
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap between formatter node label and UTILITY axis label at the
    bottom-left endpoint
  - Node labels (15pt) could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Axis labels lack descriptive context about what determines node position along
    each axis (e.g., sorted by degree)
