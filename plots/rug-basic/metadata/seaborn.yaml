review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing bimodal distribution with clear clustering patterns,
    gaps, and outliers
  - Clean, minimalist presentation appropriate for rug plots with hidden y-axis
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good use of alpha transparency and line width for visibility in dense regions
  - Realistic response time scenario that demonstrates practical rug plot applications
  weaknesses:
  - Could complement the rug plot with a KDE or histogram overlay to better demonstrate
    spec note that rug plots work best as a complement to other plots
  image_description: 'The plot shows a basic rug plot with blue vertical tick marks
    (#306998 color) along the bottom of the canvas. The x-axis is labeled "Response
    Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to 600. The title reads "rug-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The rug marks clearly show a bimodal distribution: a dense cluster
    of ~80 marks around 100-200ms (fast responses), a sparser cluster of ~40 marks
    around 300-400ms (slow responses), and a few isolated outlier marks near 50ms,
    520ms, and 550ms. A subtle dashed gray grid (alpha ~0.3) appears on the x-axis
    only. The y-axis has no labels or ticks, providing clean whitespace above the
    rug marks.'

        comment: Uses sns.rugplot which is the correct function, but this is basic
          library usage rather than distinctive seaborn features
