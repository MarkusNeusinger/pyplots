review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal custom Style for colorblind-safe palette and consistent
    sizing
  - Rich interactive tooltips showing symbol, date, and value for each data point
  - Proper rebasing of stock prices to 100 for performance comparison
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - 'Uses pygal-specific features: stroke_dasharray, show_only_major_dots, dual output
    (PNG + HTML)'
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels are not displaying despite being set in code - this is critical
    for a time series chart
  - Reference line at 100 (starting point) is not visible in the rendered output despite
    being added with stroke_dasharray
  - Legend positioned far from chart in top-left corner
  image_description: The plot displays a multi-line chart comparing four stock price
    series (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, SPY) normalized to a starting point of 100. AAPL is
    shown in blue, GOOGL in yellow/gold, MSFT in red/pink, and SPY (Benchmark) in
    teal/green. The title "line-stock-comparison · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top center. The Y-axis is labeled "Rebased Price (Start = 100)" showing values
    from approximately 80 to 170. The X-axis is labeled "Date" but the actual date
    labels are missing/not visible. The legend is positioned in the top-left corner
    outside the plot area. Horizontal dotted grid lines are visible. The series show
    different performance trajectories with SPY reaching highest (~170), GOOGL showing
    strong growth (~155), AAPL fluctuating around 100-115, and MSFT declining to ~80
    by year end. The reference line at 100 (coded in the implementation) is not visible
    in the output.
