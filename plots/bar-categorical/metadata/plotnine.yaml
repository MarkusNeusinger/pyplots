  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_bar() for automatic count
    computation
  - Smart use of pd.Categorical to enforce logical ordering of satisfaction levels
  - Clean, publication-quality visual design with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700
    resolution
  - Good choice of diverging color palette that semantically matches satisfaction
    levels (blue=good, orange=poor)
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Could use scale_fill_brewer() with a diverging palette instead of manual colors
    for better colorblind accessibility
  - Missing count annotations on bars which would enhance readability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing customer satisfaction
    survey results. Five categories are shown on the x-axis: "Excellent", "Good",
    "Average", "Poor", and "Very Poor" (in logical order from best to worst). The
    y-axis shows "Number of Responses" ranging from 0 to approximately 65. The bars
    use a gradient color scheme from blue tones (Excellent=#306998, Good=#4A90C2)
    through yellow (Average=#FFD43B) to orange-brown tones (Poor=#E8A838, Very Poor=#CC6633).
    The "Good" category has the highest count (~66), followed by "Excellent" (~55),
    "Average" (~36), "Poor" (~27), and "Very Poor" (~15). The title correctly shows
    "bar-categorical · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The plot has a clean minimal theme
    with no legend (appropriately hidden since colors match x-axis labels), subtle
    horizontal grid lines, and well-proportioned layout filling the canvas appropriately.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_bar for automatic counting,
          pd.Categorical for ordering, but could leverage more plotnine features like
          stat_count annotations or scale_fill_brewer
  verdict: APPROVED
