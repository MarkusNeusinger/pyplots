review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three distinct, realistically contextualized
    urban clusters (downtown, campus, transit hub) creating natural visual hierarchy
  - All text sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for 4800x2700 output — fully
    readable
  - Viridis colormap provides perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Interactive tooltips via layer_tooltips() demonstrate letsplot-distinctive features
  - Clean, idiomatic letsplot code following proper ggplot2-style grammar
  weaknesses:
  - No log scale for color mapping despite density ranging from ~1 to ~250 — low-density
    spatial structure is lost in dark purple
  - Standard viridis palette is functional but not distinctive — a more refined or
    custom color treatment would elevate aesthetic sophistication
  - Some canvas space underutilized in sparse data regions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization of simulated
    GPS ping density across a metro area. Three distinct density clusters are visible:
    (1) a large, diffuse downtown cluster in the upper-right quadrant centered around
    east 4km / north 3km with moderate density (blue-teal hexagons, ~100-150 pings),
    (2) a university campus cluster on the left side centered around east -3km / north
    1km with moderate density (teal-green hexagons), and (3) a tight, bright transit
    hub cluster at the bottom center around east 0.5km / north -3.5km showing the
    highest density (yellow hexagons reaching ~250 pings). The viridis colormap runs
    from dark purple (low count) through teal/green to yellow (high count). Hexagons
    have thin white edges providing clean separation. The background is light gray
    (#FAFAFA) with subtle dashed grid lines. Axes are labeled "East-West (km from
    center)" and "North-South (km from center)". Title reads "hexbin-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai". A "Ping Count" colorbar legend sits on the right.'
