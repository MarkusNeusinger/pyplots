  strengths:
  - Well-organized 4×3 grid layout that clearly shows patterns across regions and
    seasons
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue/orange/teal)
  - Good text sizing throughout - all labels are clearly readable
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation in the data
  - Clean, reproducible code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - HTML-based legend (Div element) does not render in PNG export - only small colored
    artifacts appear in subplot corners
  - No use of Bokeh distinctive interactive features (hover tooltips, linked brushing,
    pan/zoom tools)
  image_description: The plot displays a 4×3 faceted grid showing the relationship
    between Marketing Spend ($K) and Sales ($K) across three regions (North, South,
    East) and four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). Each subplot contains approximately
    25 scatter points. Colors are blue (#306998) for North, orange (#E69F00) for South,
    and teal (#4ECDC4) for East. The title "facet-grid · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center. Facet labels (e.g., "North · Spring") appear in the top-left
    of each cell. The grid uses dashed gray lines with subtle opacity. Y-axis labels
    "Sales ($K)" appear only on the leftmost column, and X-axis labels "Marketing
    Spend ($K)" appear only on the bottom row. There are small colored circular artifacts
    visible in the top-right corner of each subplot.

        comment: Uses basic scatter plots with ColumnDataSource. Does not leverage
          Bokeh's distinctive features like hover tooltips, linked brushing, or interactive
          tools. The legend is implemented via HTML Div which doesn't render in static
          PNG export.
  verdict: APPROVED
