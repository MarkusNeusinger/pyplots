review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized streamlines and viridis color encoding
  - Creative solution using seaborn lineplot with units parameter to render individual
    streamlines
  - Proper Euler integration for tracing streamlines through the vector field
  - Clean vortex pattern demonstrates the circular flow field effectively
  - Arrowheads correctly indicate flow direction
  - Good use of seaborn theming (sns.set_theme, sns.set_context, sns.despine)
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar label missing units in rendered output
  - Axis labels in rendered image missing units despite being in code
  image_description: 'The plot shows a series of concentric circular streamlines visualizing
    a vortex flow field. The streamlines are colored using the viridis colormap, ranging
    from dark purple (inner rings, ~0.8 m/s) through blues and greens (middle rings)
    to yellow (outer rings, ~3.0 m/s). The plot has a square 1:1 aspect ratio with
    axes ranging from -3 to 3 on both X and Y. Axis labels show "X Position" and "Y
    Position" (missing units on axes). A colorbar on the right indicates "Flow Speed"
    (also missing units). The title correctly follows the required format: "streamline-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The grid is subtle (dashed, low alpha). Small arrowheads
    are visible on the streamlines indicating counter-clockwise flow direction.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with hue/units, sns.set_theme, sns.despine, sns.color_palette
          - good usage but streamlines aren't a native seaborn plot type, mostly relies
          on matplotlib FancyArrowPatch for arrows
  verdict: APPROVED
