review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of a chess board with proper traditional colors
    and styling
  - Unicode chess symbols are large, clear, and well-positioned within squares
  - White pieces have dark outlines for excellent visibility on light squares
  - Proper chess board orientation with white at bottom and correct light square position
    (h1)
  - Good use of Altair layering with board squares as base layer and pieces as overlaid
    text marks
  - Correct title format following the pyplots convention
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Could add Altair interactivity (tooltips showing piece type and square name on
    hover)
  - The Scholar's Mate position is slightly unconventional (black king on e7 instead
    of e8)
  - Small amount of extra padding/whitespace below the board
  image_description: The plot shows a chess board displaying a "Scholar's Mate Setup"
    position. The board uses traditional chess square colors - cream/tan (#F0D9B5)
    for light squares and brown (#B58863) for dark squares. The board is oriented
    with white at the bottom (row 1) and black at the top (row 8), following standard
    chess convention. Files (a-h) are labeled at the bottom in brown color, and ranks
    (1-8) are labeled on the left side. All 32 pieces from an early-game position
    are displayed using Unicode chess symbols. White pieces are rendered in off-white
    with dark outlines for visibility, while black pieces are solid dark gray/black.
    The position shows a Scholar's Mate setup with the white queen on h5, white bishop
    on c4, and the black king exposed on e7. The title "Scholar's Mate Setup · chessboard-pieces
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark gray text. The board has a subtle
    brown border around the entire grid. The square aspect ratio (approximately 1:1)
    works well for the chess board visualization.
