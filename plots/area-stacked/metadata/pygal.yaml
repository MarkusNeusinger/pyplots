review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stacked area visualization with clear separation of all four product
    categories
  - Realistic retail revenue data with convincing seasonal patterns (December peaks)
  - Proper use of pygal StackedLine with fill=True for stacked areas
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good color palette with sufficient contrast between adjacent series
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner overlaps with the plot area; legend_at_bottom=True
    would be cleaner
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current y_guides are acceptable but could use
    lower opacity)
