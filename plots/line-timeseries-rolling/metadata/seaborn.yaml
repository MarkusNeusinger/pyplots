review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between raw data (thin, semi-transparent blue) and
    rolling average (thick, prominent yellow)
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-chosen window size (7-day) clearly shown in legend
  - Clean seasonal trend from winter to summer demonstrates the smoothing effect beautifully
  - Good use of seaborn DataFrame-native plotting with sns.lineplot
  - Proper font scaling using sns.set_context
  weaknesses:
  - Raw data line could be slightly more prominent (perhaps linewidth=2 or alpha=0.5)
    to better show daily fluctuations
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like confidence intervals or statistical
    annotations
  - Grid legend has framealpha=0.9 which could be reduced slightly for a cleaner look
