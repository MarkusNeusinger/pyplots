review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent four-panel vertical layout matching specification requirements perfectly
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple, teal) with strong visual
    distinction
  - Proper handling of NaN values in trend and residual components
  - Uses statsmodels seasonal_decompose for authentic decomposition
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Clean data generation with realistic airline passenger scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python library as specified in library rules, uses
    raw dict configurations instead
  - Subtitle font sizes could be larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Y-axis labels missing units on Trend, Seasonal, and Residual panels
  - Legend completely disabled rather than minimal legend showing component names
