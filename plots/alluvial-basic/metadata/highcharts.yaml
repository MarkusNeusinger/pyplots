review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial structure using Highcharts sankey with explicit
    column positioning for strict vertical ordering
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/purple/yellow) maintains visual distinction
  - 'Good use of transparency (linkOpacity: 0.4) for overlapping flow visibility'
  - Custom HTML legend provides clear color reference at bottom
  - Annotations used creatively for year labels since sankey has no native x-axis
  - Interactive HTML version with meaningful tooltips showing voter counts
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra text before required format; should be just spec-id · library
    · pyplots.ai
  - Subtitle font size could be slightly larger for better readability at 4800x2700
