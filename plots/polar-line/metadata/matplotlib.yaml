review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of square format (12x12) which is ideal for polar coordinate
    plots
  - Smart use of seasonal temperature data that naturally demonstrates cyclical patterns
  - Clean color scheme with colorblind-safe yellow and blue that provide strong contrast
  - Proper closing of the line loop by appending the first point, creating a complete
    circle
  - Comprehensive radial axis labeling with temperature units (°C)
  - Time-based theta labels that directly relate to the cyclical nature of the data
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement at bbox_to_anchor=(0.95, 0.95) places it slightly outside the
    natural visual flow
  - Could leverage matplotlib fill_between or polar-specific features for enhanced
    visualization
  image_description: The plot displays a polar line chart showing hourly temperature
    patterns across 24 hours for two seasons. The outer yellow/gold line represents
    Summer temperatures (ranging from approximately 12°C to 28°C), while the inner
    blue line represents Winter temperatures (ranging from approximately 0°C to 10°C).
    The angular axis shows time in 3-hour intervals (0:00, 3:00, 6:00, 9:00, 12:00,
    15:00, 18:00, 21:00) around the circle. The radial axis displays temperature with
    concentric circles at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, and 30°C. Both lines have circular markers
    at each data point and form closed loops. The legend is positioned in the upper
    right. The title reads "Hourly Temperature Pattern · polar-line · matplotlib ·
    pyplots.ai" at the top. The plot uses a square format with clean, subtle grid
    lines.
