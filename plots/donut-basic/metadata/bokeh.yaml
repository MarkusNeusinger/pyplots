review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh annular_wedge for creating donut shape with proper inner/outer
    radius
  - 'Clean center annotation showing summary statistic (Total: 100) as spec recommends'
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource and cumsum transform for angle calculations
  - Proper white segment separators (line_width=4) enhance readability
  - Smart text color contrast logic (white on dark backgrounds, dark on light)
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows percentage values redundantly - should show actual values instead
    of duplicating percentages visible on segments
  - 'Two similar teal colors (#4ECDC4 and #95E1D3) could be harder to distinguish
    for some users'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart (ring chart) showing portfolio
    allocation across 5 asset classes. The chart uses a square 3600x3600 format with
    the donut centered slightly left. Colors used are: Python Blue (#306998) for Technology
    (35%), Yellow (#FFD43B) for Healthcare (25%), Teal (#4ECDC4) for Finance (20%),
    Coral/Red (#FF6B6B) for Energy (12%), and Light Teal (#95E1D3) for Retail (8%).
    Percentage labels are positioned within each segment. The center displays "Total"
    with "100" below it in Python Blue. A legend on the right side shows each category
    with its percentage. The title "donut-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top left.'
