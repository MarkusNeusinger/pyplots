review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including sorted horizontal
    bars, color gradient, error bars, and value annotations
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic ML model context with credit/loan prediction features
  - Good visual hierarchy with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper positioning of annotations after error bars to avoid overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Layout margins are somewhat generous on the left side; could utilize canvas space
    slightly better
  - Y-axis label "Feature" could be omitted since the feature names are self-explanatory
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features in the HTML output (hover
    templates, custom interactions)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing 15 machine
    learning feature importances from a credit/loan prediction model. Features are
    sorted by importance with "age" at the top (0.179) and "investment_portfolio"
    at the bottom (0.005). The bars use a blue gradient color scheme (RGBA with varying
    alpha from ~0.4 to 1.0) where darker/more opaque blue indicates higher importance.
    Each bar includes error bars (horizontal lines) representing standard deviation
    from ensemble methods. Importance values are annotated as text labels at the end
    of each bar after the error bars. The y-axis shows feature names, x-axis shows
    "Importance Score" ranging from 0 to ~0.2. The title follows the correct format:
    "bar-feature-importance · plotly · pyplots.ai". Layout is clean with white background,
    subtle gray grid lines, and proper margins allowing all feature names to be fully
    visible.'
