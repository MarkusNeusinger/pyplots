review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation using DFS algorithm that guarantees a single solution
    path
  - Perfect black-and-white print-friendly design with high contrast
  - Well-placed start (S) and goal (G) markers with clear visual distinction
  - Appropriate square format (3600x3600) ideal for maze puzzles
  - Clean interactive HTML version generated alongside PNG
  - Proper use of heatmap for cell-based visualization
  weaknesses:
  - The recursive DFS function breaks strict KISS pattern (minor, but necessary for
    algorithm)
  - Could use Highcharts annotations API for markers instead of separate scatter series
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 cell maze puzzle rendered as a heatmap
    with black walls and white passages on a white background. The maze fills the
    majority of the canvas in a square format (3600x3600px). At the top-left corner,
    there is a blue triangle marker with an "S" label indicating the start position.
    At the bottom-right corner, there is a yellow/gold diamond marker with a "G" label
    indicating the goal position. The title "maze-printable · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle "Find the path from S (Start)
    to G (Goal)" below it. The maze has consistent wall thickness and clear passages
    suitable for pen/pencil marking. The black-and-white design is print-friendly
    with maximum contrast.
