quality_score: 78
review:
  strengths:
  - 'Full spec compliance: all required features present (both ECDFs, K-S statistic,
    max divergence line, p-value, legend)'
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate data generation using beta distributions
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with fixed seed
  - Good use of Highcharts step line feature for ECDFs
  - Subtitle effectively communicates statistical results
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps with X-axis Credit Score label at bottom — increase marginBottom
    or reposition legend
  - Y-axis tick density is excessive (every 0.025) — use 0.1 or 0.2 intervals for
    cleaner appearance
  - Max distance line lacks visual emphasis — consider thicker line, brighter color,
    or annotation arrow pointing to it
  - No visual hierarchy guiding the viewer to the key insight (the separation point)
  - Design is functional but generic — could benefit from color refinement, better
    focal point emphasis
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step lines on a white background. The blue line represents "Good Customers"
    and the red line represents "Bad Customers," plotted against credit scores (200–980)
    on the X-axis and cumulative proportion (0–1) on the Y-axis. A dashed black vertical
    line with diamond markers at both ends highlights the point of maximum divergence
    at approximately credit score 600, spanning from ~0.10 (Good) to ~0.83 (Bad).
    The title reads "ks-test-comparison · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold black text,
    with a gray subtitle showing "K-S Statistic = 0.7300 | p-value = 9.54e-78." The
    legend is positioned at the bottom center and overlaps slightly with the "Credit
    Score" X-axis label. Y-axis tick labels are dense (every 0.025 increment). Grid
    lines are very subtle gray. The two curves clearly separate, with bad customers
    accumulating CDF mass much faster at lower credit scores.
