review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-differentiated lines using color and dash styles
  - Proper handling of NaN values for initial SMA periods (filtered out correctly)
  - Clean, well-structured code with good separation of concerns
  - Colorblind-safe palette following project guidelines
  - Appropriate use of Highcharts tooltip sharing for multi-series comparison
  - Realistic stock data generation with trend and volatility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be better integrated within the plot area rather than floating outside
  - Does not use Highcharts Stock module which would provide native financial chart
    features like range selector
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a stock price chart with Simple Moving Average (SMA) overlays over approximately 365 business days from January 2024 to May 2025. The chart shows:

    - Close Price (blue solid line, #306998) - the main price series showing typical stock price volatility with an overall upward trend from ~$150 to ~$195
    - SMA 20 (yellow solid line, #FFD43B) - short-term moving average closely following the price
    - SMA 50 (cyan dashed line, #17BECF) - medium-term moving average showing smoother trend
    - SMA 200 (purple long-dashed line, #9467BD) - long-term moving average starting later due to the 200-day calculation window

    The title "indicator-sma · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle describing the chart. The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" with dollar values ranging from $126 to $212. The X-axis shows dates formatted as "Month Year". A legend is positioned in the upper right corner identifying all four series. Grid lines are visible but subtle.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are all clearly readable. Font
          sizes are appropriate for the 4800x2700 canvas, though tick labels could
          be slightly larger.

        comment: Line widths are appropriate. The price line is prominently thicker
          (5px) while SMA lines are thinner (3px). Lines are clearly distinguishable.

        score: 0

        passed: false
        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate. However, the legend is positioned
          outside the plot area on the upper right, which is functional but could
          be better integrated.

        comment: Uses Highcharts datetime axis, tooltip formatting with shared tooltip
          and value formatting. Uses dashStyle for line differentiation. Could leverage
          more Highcharts-specific features like stock chart module or interactive
          zooming.
