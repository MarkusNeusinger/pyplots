review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal layout with variables on y-axis for readability with long
    names
  - Clean visual distinction between significant and non-significant coefficients
    using colorblind-safe colors
  - Well-implemented zero reference line with clear label
  - Interactive tooltips provide coefficient and CI values on hover
  - Proper use of xrange series type for confidence interval bars
  weaknesses:
  - 'Confidence interval line widths (pointWidth: 8) could be slightly thicker for
    better visibility'
  - Grid styling only has vertical lines; subtle horizontal lines at each variable
    level would improve readability
  image_description: The plot displays a coefficient plot with confidence intervals
    for a housing price regression model. Ten predictor variables are shown on the
    y-axis (Distance to City Center, Crime Rate Index, Property Tax Rate, Year Built,
    Lot Size, Number of Bedrooms, Garage Spaces, Number of Bathrooms, School Rating,
    Square Footage), ordered by coefficient magnitude from bottom (highest positive)
    to top (most negative). The x-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)"
    ranging from approximately -0.3 to 0.6. Each coefficient is represented by a circular
    marker with a horizontal line showing the 95% confidence interval. A vertical
    dashed line at x=0 marks the null hypothesis threshold, labeled "Null (β = 0)".
    Significant coefficients (p < 0.05) are shown in blue (#306998), while non-significant
    coefficients are shown in yellow/gold (#FFD43B) with a darker border. The title
    follows the required format "coefficient-confidence · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    with a subtitle explaining the context. The legend at the bottom distinguishes
    "Significant (p < 0.05)" and "Not Significant" categories.
