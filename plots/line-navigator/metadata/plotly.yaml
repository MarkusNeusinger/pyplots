review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly rangeslider for mini navigator concept - perfect library
    choice for this specification
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, All) provide additional navigation convenience
    beyond spec requirements
  - Realistic temperature sensor data with clear seasonal patterns spanning 3 years
    (1100 data points)
  - Proper hover template with formatted date and temperature value
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more Plotly interactivity features like custom buttons or annotations
  - Grid lines are quite subtle - could be slightly more visible for easier value
    reading
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing temperature sensor data
    spanning from January 2022 to January 2025 (approximately 3 years of daily data,
    ~1100 data points). The main chart shows a clear seasonal sinusoidal pattern with
    temperatures ranging from approximately 0°C to 42°C. The line is rendered in a
    blue color (#306998) with consistent width. The Y-axis is labeled "Temperature
    (°C)" and the X-axis is labeled "Date". The title follows the correct format:
    "Temperature Sensor Data · line-navigator · plotly · pyplots.ai". Below the main
    chart is a mini navigator pane (rangeslider) showing the full data extent in a
    compressed view, allowing users to select and zoom into specific date ranges.
    Range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, All) are visible in the top-left corner.
    The plot uses a clean white background with subtle grid lines.'
