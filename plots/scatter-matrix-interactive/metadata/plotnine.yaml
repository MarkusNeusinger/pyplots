review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with facet_grid for matrix layout
  - Creative solution using geom_ribbon for histogram-based density distributions
    on diagonal
  - Colorblind-safe palette (Dark2-inspired teal, orange, purple)
  - Clean data transformation from wide to long format for faceting
  - Good visual separation of the three Iris species clusters
  - Proper title format following specification
  weaknesses:
  - Missing interactive features (brushing, linked selection, zoom/pan) - plotnine
    is static library
  - Axis labels are empty strings - variable names only shown in strip text
  - Diagonal density plots y-axis scale does not match the variable natural scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) using the
    Iris dataset with four variables: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal Length
    (cm), and Petal Width (cm). The matrix uses a colorblind-safe Dark2-inspired palette
    with teal (#1B9E77) for setosa, orange (#D95F02) for versicolor, and purple (#7570B3)
    for virginica. Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots with points colored by species
    at alpha=0.7. Diagonal cells display histogram-based density distributions as
    filled ribbon areas with alpha=0.5, showing the univariate distribution of each
    variable per species. The title "scatter-matrix-interactive · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top-left in bold. Strip labels on top show variable names for x-axis,
    and strip labels on right show variable names for y-axis. A legend at the bottom
    indicates species color mapping. The grid is subtle with light gray lines. The
    layout is clean with minimal spacing between panels.'
