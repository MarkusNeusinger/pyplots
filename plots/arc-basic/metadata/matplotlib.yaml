review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of arc diagram with proper proportional arc heights based
    on node distance
  - 'Clean visual design with Python-themed color palette (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow)'
  - Appropriate use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.55) for overlapping arcs
  - Weight-based arc thickness provides clear visual differentiation of connection
    strength
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (character interactions) that clearly demonstrates
    the plot type
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend showing what arc thickness represents (weight scale)
  - Could use color coding for different edge types or weights as mentioned in spec
    notes
  - Library features score could improve by using colormap for arcs based on weight
