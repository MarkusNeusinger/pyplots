review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Good filled contour visualization using mark_rect with discrete color bands
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-structured data with two Gaussian peaks and a valley showing variation
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Contour line overlay using white points is unconventional and does not provide
    clear level identification as specified
  - The white point markers for contour lines create visual noise rather than clean
    isolines
