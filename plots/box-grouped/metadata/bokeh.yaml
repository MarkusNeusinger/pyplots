review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text elements (36pt title, 28pt labels,
    22pt ticks)
  - Clean implementation of grouped box plots with proper spacing between subcategories
  - Good color palette (Python Blue, Python Yellow, Teal) that is colorblind-accessible
  - 'Proper statistical box plot components: median, quartiles, whiskers at 1.5×IQR,
    and outliers'
  - Realistic HR scenario with meaningful data variations across departments and experience
    levels
  - Correct title format and well-placed legend
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function calc_boxplot_stats slightly deviates from KISS principle (though
    understandable for box plots)
  - One outlier value (105) slightly exceeds typical 100-point performance scale
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific interactive features (HoverTool would enhance
    the plot)
