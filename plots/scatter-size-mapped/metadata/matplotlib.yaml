review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bubble chart with clear three-dimensional data encoding
  - Well-designed size legend using logarithmic scaling for population visibility
  - Smart use of regional profiles to generate realistic, varied synthetic data
  - Clean separation of region and size legends without overlap
  - Proper use of white edge colors and alpha transparency for overlapping bubble
    visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Red (Asia) and green (Africa) color combination may cause accessibility issues
    for colorblind users
  - Could annotate a few notable outlier points as suggested in the spec Notes section
  - Two legends make the plot slightly busy - could potentially combine or simplify
