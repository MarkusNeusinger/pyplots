review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions with meaningful outliers across
    plants
  - Clean KISS code structure following all matplotlib guidelines
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800×2700 output (s=150, alpha=0.7, proper font sizes)
  - Effective jitter implementation prevents point overlap
  - Professional manufacturing QC context is neutral and relatable
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels are set but ax.legend() is never called, resulting in unused code
    (labels in scatter calls)
  - No distinctive matplotlib features used beyond basic scatter - could leverage
    ax.errorbar() for confidence intervals or custom marker styles
  image_description: The plot displays a categorical strip plot showing quality scores
    (y-axis, 0-100 scale) for five manufacturing plants (Plant A through Plant E on
    x-axis). Each plant's data points are displayed as colored circles with horizontal
    jitter to prevent overlap. Plant A (blue, ~80-93 range), Plant B (yellow/gold,
    wide spread ~55-95 with visible outliers), Plant C (teal/cyan, tight cluster ~82-95),
    Plant D (orange, widest spread ~40-88 with low outliers), and Plant E (olive green,
    moderate spread ~68-95). The title reads "cat-strip · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    A subtle gray dashed grid is visible on the y-axis. Points have white edge outlines
    and good transparency (alpha ~0.7).

        comment: Markers sized at s=150 with alpha=0.7, appropriate for ~27 points
          per category. Minor deduction as slightly smaller markers might reduce minimal
