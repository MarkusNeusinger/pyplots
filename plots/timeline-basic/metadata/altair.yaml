review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis prevents overlap perfectly
  - Creative inline legend implementation that integrates with the chart
  - Clean layered chart architecture using alt.layer() for composability
  - Good use of Altair declarative encoding system with proper type annotations
  - Appropriate color palette with good accessibility
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional detail on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Event labels at 16pt fontSize could be slightly larger (18pt) for better readability
  - Inline legend positioned close to top event labels, could use more vertical separation
  - Could add .interactive() to enable zoom/pan for exploring dense timelines
