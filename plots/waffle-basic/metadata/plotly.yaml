review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color palette with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color and complementary
    colorblind-safe colors
  - Clean implementation using scatter plot with square markers and white borders
    for visual separation
  - Legend format with percentages is clear and informative
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that demonstrates waffle chart purpose well
  - Proper 16:9 output at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could fill more of the canvas area for better visual impact (currently somewhat
    small relative to available space)
  - Could add hover interactivity to show category details when hovering over squares
    (Plotly strength not utilized)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10x10 waffle chart (100 squares) representing
    budget allocation across 5 categories. From bottom to top: dark blue squares for
    Operations (35%), golden yellow squares for Marketing (25%), teal/cyan squares
    for R&D (22%), coral/orange squares for HR (12%), and purple squares for Other
    (6%). The title "Budget Allocation · waffle-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top in black text. A horizontal legend below the grid shows all categories
    with their percentages. The squares have white borders separating them, and the
    overall background is white.'
