review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of interactive features using Altair's declarative selection
    API
  - Comprehensive tooltips showing 5 data fields (product, revenue, units, percentage,
    growth)
  - Smart use of conditional color/opacity encoding for click feedback
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format with helpful subtitle explaining interactions
  - Good use of Python brand colors maintaining visual identity
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be slightly more subtle (alpha 0.2 instead of 0.3)
  - Could demonstrate additional Altair interactivity features like brush selection
    or zoom
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive bar chart showing quarterly
    product sales data for 8 tech product categories. Bars are rendered in Python
    Yellow (#FFD43B) with a blue stroke (#306998) outline, sorted by sales revenue
    in descending order (Laptops highest at ~$245K, Speakers lowest at ~$38K). The
    title "bar-interactive · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    explaining interaction instructions. X-axis labels are angled at -30° showing
    product names (Laptops, Monitors, Tablets, Keyboards, Mice, Headsets, Webcams,
    Speakers). Y-axis shows "Sales Revenue ($)" with values formatted with commas.
    A subtle dashed grid pattern aids value reading. Bars have rounded top corners
    for a polished appearance.
