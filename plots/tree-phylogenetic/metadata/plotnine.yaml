review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics to construct a tree from segments
    and points
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny topology with realistic evolutionary
    relationships
  - Good color coding by clade makes the tree structure intuitive
  - Scale bar provides important context for branch length interpretation
  - Clean publication-quality appearance with theme_void()
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Scale bar label text appears somewhat small compared to other text elements
  - Legend is hidden - adding a small clade legend would improve interpretability
  - The axis label for evolutionary distance is set but invisible due to theme_void()
