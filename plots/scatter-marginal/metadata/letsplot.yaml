  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggbunch to combine three separate plots into a cohesive composite
    visualization
  - Clean axis alignment between main scatter and marginal plots using shared limits
  - Both histogram and KDE overlay in marginals provides comprehensive distribution
    view
  - Good color scheme with colorblind-safe blue points and contrasting red KDE curves
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output (24/20/16 pt hierarchy)
  - Reproducible with fixed seed
  weaknesses:
  - Title placement is unconventional - appears between top histogram and main scatter
    rather than at very top
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without real-world context or units
  - Right marginal histogram extends slightly past main plot area creating minor misalignment
    at bottom
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with marginal distributions
    arranged in a composite layout. The main scatter plot occupies the lower-left
    area showing ~200 blue points (#306998) with positive correlation between X Value
    (range 4-16) and Y Value (range 3-17). The top marginal shows a horizontal histogram
    with blue/gray bars and a red KDE curve overlaid, displaying the X distribution.
    The right marginal shows a vertical (rotated) histogram with blue/gray bars and
    red KDE curve for the Y distribution. The title "scatter-marginal · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears between the top histogram and main plot. Axis labels are "X
    Value" and "Y Value". The layout uses ggbunch to combine three separate plots.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are clearly readable. Title uses
          size=24, axis titles size=20, tick text size=16 - all appropriate for the
          4800×2700 output.

        comment: Points are well-sized (size=4) with good alpha (0.65) for 200 data
          points. The scatter pattern and correlation are clearly visible.

        comment: Uses colorblind-safe blue (#306998) for points and red (#DC2626)
          for KDE curves - good contrast and distinction.

        comment: 'Good use of ggbunch for layout. The title placement between top
          histogram and main plot is unusual but functional. Minor: margins could
          be slightly tighter.'

        comment: Descriptive labels "X Value" and "Y Value" but without units (acceptable
          for generic example data).

        comment: Minimal theme with subtle grid. No legend needed for single-series
          plot. Grid visible but unobtrusive.

        comment: Shows positive correlation clearly. Both marginal distributions show
          roughly normal shape. Could show more interesting distribution features
          (bimodality, outliers).

        comment: Uses ggbunch for combining plots (lets-plot specific), coord_flip
          for right histogram, proper theme customization. Good use of ggplot2-style
          grammar. Could use more advanced features like flavor themes or tooltips.
  verdict: APPROVED
