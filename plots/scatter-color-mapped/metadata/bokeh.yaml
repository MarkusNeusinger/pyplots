review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and color mapping system with LinearColorMapper
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizes scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of Viridis colormap for accessibility
  - Proper colorbar with title and well-configured label sizes
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low alpha
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than descriptive with units
  - Could add HoverTool for interactive tooltips in HTML output
  - Points could be slightly larger (size=35-40) given the data density
  image_description: The plot displays a color-mapped scatter plot with approximately
    150 data points on a light gray background (#fafafa). The X-axis ("X Value") ranges
    from approximately 25 to 75, and the Y-axis ("Y Value") ranges from approximately
    25 to 85. Points are colored using the Viridis colormap (purple/blue for low values
    through green to yellow for high values), representing an "Intensity" variable
    shown in the colorbar on the right side. The colorbar ranges from 0 to approximately
    35. The title "scatter-color-mapped · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left.
    Points show a positive correlation between X and Y, with intensity values increasing
    for points farther from the center (around 50,50). The grid uses subtle dashed
    lines with low alpha. Point sizes are uniform and appropriately sized for the
    data density.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, LinearColorMapper, linear_cmap transform,
          and ColorBar which are Bokeh-specific, but doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive
          features like hover tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
