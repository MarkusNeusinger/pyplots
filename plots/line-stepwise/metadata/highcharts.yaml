review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of step line using Highcharts native step: left option'
  - Realistic and relevant data scenario (server response time monitoring)
  - Clear step pattern showing discrete value changes throughout the day
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Good use of subtitle for additional context
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Saves both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Image dimensions slightly off (2561 vs 2700 height)
  - Legend could be slightly larger for better visibility at high resolution
  - Could utilize more Highcharts-specific interactive features like custom tooltips
  image_description: 'The plot displays a step line chart showing server response
    time over a 24-hour monitoring period. The chart uses Python blue (#306998) for
    the line and markers. The title "line-stepwise · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top with a subtitle "Server Response Time (24-Hour Monitoring)". The X-axis
    shows "Hour of Day" with time labels from 00:00 to 22:00 in 2-hour intervals.
    The Y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 40 to 100. The step pattern
    is clearly visible with horizontal segments showing value persistence and vertical
    segments showing instantaneous changes. Data points are marked with blue circles.
    The legend "Response Time" appears in the top-right corner. The chart shows realistic
    server load patterns: low response times (~48-54ms) during night hours (00:00-06:00),
    increased times during morning (~72-80ms at 06:00-09:00), lunch peak (~80-82ms
    at 12:00-14:00), evening peak reaching ~91ms around 17:00-18:00, then declining
    to ~50-59ms in late evening.'
