review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with median annotations, overall mean reference line,
    and comparative insight annotation
  - 'Strong lets-plot idiomatic usage: as_discrete with order_by for automatic sorting
    by median, layer_tooltips with stat references for interactive HTML version'
  - Clean visual refinement with flavor_high_contrast_light, removed x-grid, subtle
    y-grid, hidden legend
  - Well-chosen realistic business scenario with appropriate salary ranges
  - Dollar-formatted y-axis and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging lets-plot interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - The insight annotation Eng. +56% vs HR is displaced leftward (nudge_x=-0.5) placing
    it between Finance and Engineering rather than clearly associated with Engineering
    — repositioning or using an arrow would improve clarity
  - 'The Avg: $71,502 label positioned near HR box crowds that area — consider placing
    it at the right edge of the plot'
  - Two blue-ish tones (Sales light blue, Engineering dark steel-blue) reduce color
    accessibility for color vision deficiencies — swapping one for a more distinct
    hue would help
  - Minor right margin waste from plot_margin 60px right padding
  image_description: 'The plot displays five box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one per department (HR, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Engineering), ordered left-to-right
    by ascending median salary. Each box uses a distinct fill color: HR in green,
    Marketing in orange, Sales in light blue, Finance in pink, and Engineering in
    dark steel-blue. Median dollar values are annotated in bold above each box ($54,599
    through $85,333). A dashed gray horizontal reference line marks the overall average
    salary at $71,502, labeled near the HR box. A bold italic insight annotation "Eng.
    +56% vs HR" is placed between the Finance and Engineering boxes. Outliers appear
    as large filled circles above and below whiskers. The y-axis is formatted in USD
    ($20,000-$140,000), labeled "Annual Salary (USD)". The x-axis is labeled "Department".
    Title reads "box-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Salary distributions
    across five departments, ordered by median". Background is clean white with subtle
    horizontal grid lines only.'
