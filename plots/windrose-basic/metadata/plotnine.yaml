review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of polar coordinates using geom_polygon since plotnine
    lacks native coord_polar support
  - Clean color progression from cool (calm) to warm (strong) following meteorological
    convention
  - Comprehensive manual legend with all speed bins clearly labeled with units
  - Well-positioned compass direction labels that do not overlap with data
  - Realistic coastal weather station data scenario with clear prevailing SW winds
  - Subtle dashed gridlines with frequency percentage labels for scale reference
  - Good use of white borders between wedges to distinguish stacked segments
  weaknesses:
  - Manual legend implementation is functional but less elegant than plotnine native
    legend system
  - Title uses regular periods/dots as separators rather than middle dots per the
    format spec
  - The polar coordinate workaround while creative results in complex code that is
    harder to maintain
