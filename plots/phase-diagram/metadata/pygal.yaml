review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of phase space concepts with both damped and undamped
    trajectories
  - Clean visual distinction between the spiral (damped) and closed loop (limit cycle)
    behaviors
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color scheme (blue and yellow)
  - Proper mathematical implementation of damped harmonic oscillator using Euler integration
  - Good use of pygal custom styling for large canvas rendering
  weaknesses:
  - The equilibrium point marker at origin is quite small and could be more prominent
  - The undamped oscillator trajectory shows some numerical drift (not a perfect ellipse
    due to Euler method)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phase diagram showing two oscillator trajectories
    on a white background. The title "phase-diagram · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled "Position x" (range -1.2 to
    2) and the Y-axis is labeled "Velocity dx/dt" (range -3 to 3). There are two main
    trajectories: (1) A blue spiral trajectory ("Damped Oscillator γ=0.3") that starts
    from the outer region and spirals inward toward the origin, demonstrating damped
    oscillation converging to equilibrium; (2) A yellow elliptical trajectory ("Undamped
    Oscillator (Limit Cycle)") that forms a closed loop, representing periodic motion
    without energy loss. A small red dot at the origin marks the "Equilibrium (Fixed
    Point)". The legend is displayed at the bottom with colored squares indicating
    each series. Grid lines are shown in light gray.'
  verdict: APPROVED
