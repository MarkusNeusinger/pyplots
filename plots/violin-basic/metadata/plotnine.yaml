review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot syntax
  - Proper use of draw_quantiles parameter to show 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
    inside violins
  - Good visual differentiation between groups with alternating colors
  - Correct title format and proper figure sizing for the required resolution
  - Clean, minimal theme that emphasizes the data
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Generic Group A/B/C/D labels instead of a realistic scenario (e.g., job titles,
    schools)
  - All distributions are normal - adding one skewed or bimodal distribution would
    better demonstrate violin plot capabilities
  - Axis labels lack context or units (e.g., Test Score instead of Value)
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally, each
    representing a different category (Group A, Group B, Group C, Group D). The violins
    show kernel density estimations with mirrored sides, and each contains three horizontal
    lines indicating the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles. The color scheme
    alternates between blue (#306998, #4B8BBE) for Groups A and C, and yellow (#FFD43B,
    #FFE873) for Groups B and D. The title "violin-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in a large font. The x-axis is labeled "Category" and the y-axis
    "Value". The distributions vary visibly: Group A is centered around 50, Group
    B around 65 with wider spread, Group C is narrower around 45, and Group D around
    70 with moderate spread. The minimal theme provides a clean white background.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar with geom_violin and draw_quantiles parameter,
          theme_minimal, proper plotnine idioms. Could leverage more advanced features
          like faceting or custom stats.
  verdict: APPROVED
