review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering
  - Semi-transparent overlapping histograms clearly show distribution differences
    and overlap regions
  - Realistic data scenario (user response times) that demonstrates the plot type
    effectively
  - Good color choices with sufficient contrast between groups
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend order is alphabetical rather than matching the logical data pattern (could
    order by mean response time: Power Users → Regular Users → New Users)'
