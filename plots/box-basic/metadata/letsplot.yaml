review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic salary data with appropriate distributions per department
  - Outliers properly generated and clearly visible as distinct points
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  - Different colors make categories easily distinguishable
  - Appropriate text sizes (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (currently very subtle with theme_minimal)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 box plots showing salary distributions across
    departments: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales (red), HR (green),
    and Finance (purple). Each box clearly shows the median line, IQR (box), and whiskers
    extending to 1.5*IQR. Outliers are displayed as large black dots - visible above
    Engineering (~125K, ~137K), Marketing (~107K), Sales (~125K, ~131K), HR (~30K,
    ~90K), and Finance (~120K, ~122K). The title "box-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in appropriate size. X-axis labeled "Department" and Y-axis
    labeled "Salary ($)" with values ranging from ~20,000 to 140,000. Clean minimal
    theme with subtle grid lines. Layout is well-balanced with good proportions.'
