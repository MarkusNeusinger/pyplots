review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and line elements
  - Perfect implementation of the spec with all required features (historical line,
    forecast line, vertical marker, nested confidence bands)
  - Growing uncertainty over forecast horizon is realistic and well-visualized
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot grammar with multiple geom layers
  - Informative caption explaining the confidence bands
  - Clean color scheme distinguishing historical (blue) from forecast (red/orange)
  weaknesses: []
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series visualization of product demand
    with historical data and forecast projection. The historical period (36 months
    from January 2023 to December 2025) is shown as a solid blue line with clear trend
    and seasonal patterns. The forecast period (12 months from January 2026 to December
    2026) is displayed as a red line. A vertical dotted gray line clearly marks the
    transition point between historical and forecast data at January 2026. Two nested
    confidence bands surround the forecast: a darker orange band representing the
    80% confidence interval and a lighter yellow band for the 95% confidence interval.
    The uncertainty appropriately widens as the forecast horizon extends. The title
    "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    The Y-axis is labeled "Product Demand (Units)" ranging from 90 to 210, and the
    X-axis shows "Date" with monthly labels. A legend on the right identifies "Historical"
    (blue) and "Forecast" (red) series. A caption at the bottom explains the shaded
    bands.'
