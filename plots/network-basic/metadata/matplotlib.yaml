review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation from scratch - nodes cluster by
    community naturally
  - Clean, readable node labels with good contrast (bold text on colored backgrounds)
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with four distinct colors
  - Node size encodes degree (connectivity) as suggested in spec
  - Well-organized code with clear comments explaining each section
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels are generic (Group A/B/C/D) rather than thematic
  - Edge rendering could benefit from curved edges or arrows to show connection direction
  image_description: 'The plot displays a network graph (node-link diagram) representing
    a social network with 20 people arranged in 4 communities. Nodes are circular
    with bold black labels inside (names like Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.). The four groups
    are color-coded: Group A (blue, #306998), Group B (yellow, #FFD43B), Group C (green,
    #4CAF50), and Group D (orange/coral, #FF7043). Edges are semi-transparent gray
    lines connecting nodes. The force-directed layout successfully clusters groups
    together while showing cross-community bridge connections. Node sizes vary slightly
    based on degree (number of connections). A legend titled "Communities" in the
    upper-left shows the four group colors. The title reads "Social Network · network-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The layout is clean with no axis elements visible.'

        comment: Uses LineCollection for efficient edge rendering and custom force-directed
          layout, but doesn't leverage matplotlib's more advanced capabilities like
          FancyArrowPatch or annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
