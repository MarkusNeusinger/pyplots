review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram using Altair mark_line with filled
    polygons - creative approach given Altair lacks native Sankey/alluvial support
  - Smooth Bezier-like curves using smoothstep interpolation for flow bands
  - Consistent color scheme maintained across time points as specified
  - Proper use of transparency (0.5 opacity) for overlapping flows improving readability
  - 'Clean layered architecture: flows → nodes → labels'
  - Tooltips provide additional context (party, year, voter count)
  - Professional visual quality suitable for publication
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Title includes Voter Migration prefix rather than pure spec-id format
  - No node labels directly on the chart - users must rely on colors and legend
  - Could benefit from Altair interactive features (selection, zoom)
