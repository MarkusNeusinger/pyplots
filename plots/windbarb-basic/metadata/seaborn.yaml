review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizes following guidelines
  - Well-spaced grid of barbs prevents overlap
  - Correct meteorological barb notation with proper increments (half=5, full=10,
    flag=50)
  - Realistic weather station scenario with longitude/latitude coordinates
  - Clean, reproducible code structure with proper seed
  - Good use of colorbar to show wind speed magnitude
  - Appropriate canvas size (16, 9) producing high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow barbs on light whitegrid background have reduced visibility - consider
    viridis or a colormap with darker low-end values
  - Grid could be more subtle (alpha=0.3 still noticeable) or removed entirely as
    barbs provide their own spatial structure
  - Missing demonstration of calm winds (circle notation) or pennants (50 knot flags)
    to show full range of barb notation
  - Wind speed range is moderate (5-32 knots); could include some extreme values to
    demonstrate pennants
  image_description: The plot displays a wind barb visualization on an 8x6 grid (48
    stations) showing simulated surface wind observations. Wind barbs are rendered
    in a YlOrRd (Yellow-Orange-Red) colormap where lighter yellow indicates lower
    wind speeds (~5 knots) and darker red/maroon indicates higher speeds (~30+ knots).
    Each barb shows direction via the staff orientation and speed via the attached
    barbs (half barbs for 5 knots, full barbs for 10 knots). The plot has axes labeled
    "Longitude (°E)" on the x-axis and "Latitude (°N)" on the y-axis. A colorbar on
    the right shows "Wind Speed (knots)" ranging from approximately 5 to 32 knots.
    The title correctly uses the format "windbarb-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The
    background has a subtle gray dashed grid with seaborn's whitegrid styling.

        comment: Seaborn only used for styling (set_theme, set_context); barbs drawn
          with matplotlib ax.barbs(). However, seaborn lacks native wind barb support,
          so this is an acceptable approach.
