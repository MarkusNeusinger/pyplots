review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the crossword grid using plotnine grammar of graphics
    approach
  - Perfect 180-degree rotational symmetry in black cell placement
  - Clean, publication-ready monochrome design optimized for printing
  - Proper use of geom_tile for grid cells and geom_text for clue numbers
  - Square cell aspect ratio maintained with coord_fixed(ratio=1)
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Clue numbers could be slightly larger for improved readability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a traditional 15x15 crossword puzzle grid.
    White cells represent letter entry positions, while black cells (rendered in dark
    gray #1A1A1A) serve as blocking cells. The grid exhibits 180-degree rotational
    symmetry in the black cell placement, following standard newspaper crossword conventions.
    Clue numbers (1-79) are positioned in the top-left corner of cells that start
    across or down words, rendered in small gray text. The grid has uniform square
    cells with thin dark gray (#333333) borders separating each cell. The title "crossword-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in bold black text. The background
    is white with a subtle light gray panel background (#E0E0E0) around the grid edges.
    No axis labels, ticks, or legend are present, which is appropriate for this grid-style
    visualization.'

        comment: Uses geom_tile and geom_text appropriately, coord_fixed for square
          aspect ratio, scale_fill_manual for custom colors. Basic but correct usage
          of plotnine grammar of graphics.
