review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of the forest plot with all key elements: effect sizes,
    confidence intervals, weighted markers, and pooled estimate diamond'
  - Professional visual design with appropriate color scheme (Python blue for studies,
    yellow for pooled)
  - Clear Favors Treatment/Control annotations enhance interpretability
  - Marker sizes proportional to study weights effectively communicate study importance
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend explaining that marker size represents study weight
  - All effect sizes favor treatment (none crossing the null line to favor control
    would make data more illustrative)
