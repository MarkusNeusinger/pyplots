review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with white background boxes ensuring readability against
    all overlay colors
  - Mathematically correct implementation using inclusion-exclusion principle for
    region counts
  - Good use of seaborn Set2 colorblind-safe palette and styling context
  - Clear labeling with both counts and percentages in each region
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Minor asymmetry in external label positioning (manual -0.3 offsets for bottom
    labels)
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features (seaborn has no native Venn support,
    so matplotlib patches are required)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-set Venn diagram with overlapping
    circles arranged in an equilateral triangle layout. The top circle (mint/seafoam
    green) represents Python users (n=100), the bottom-left circle (peach/salmon)
    represents JavaScript users (n=80), and the bottom-right circle (light blue/lavender)
    represents SQL users (n=60). Each region displays count values with percentages
    in white rounded boxes: Python-only=60, JavaScript-only=35, SQL-only=25, Python∩JavaScript=20,
    Python∩SQL=10, JavaScript∩SQL=15, and the central intersection (all three)=10.
    The title "venn-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black
    text. Set labels with sample sizes are positioned outside their respective circles.
    Colors are from the Set2 palette with 40% transparency, allowing overlap regions
    to be visible through color blending.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme() and sns.color_palette() for styling, but Venn
          diagrams are drawn with matplotlib patches (no native seaborn Venn support);
          this is acceptable given seaborn lacks Venn diagram functions
  verdict: APPROVED
