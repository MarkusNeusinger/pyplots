# network-force-directed: Force-Directed Graph

## Description

A force-directed graph uses physics simulation to position nodes, where connected nodes attract each other and all nodes repel. This creates organic layouts that naturally reveal community structure, central nodes, and overall network topology without manual positioning. The algorithm balances attractive forces (edges pulling connected nodes together) and repulsive forces (nodes pushing apart) until reaching equilibrium.

## Applications

- Visualizing social network connections to identify communities and influential individuals
- Mapping software dependencies to understand module relationships and coupling
- Displaying knowledge graphs and ontologies showing concept relationships
- Analyzing co-occurrence networks in text analysis or biological interactions

## Data

- `nodes` (list) - Collection of entities with unique identifiers and optional labels
- `edges` (list) - Connections between nodes with source and target IDs
- `weight` (numeric, optional) - Edge weight affecting attraction strength
- Size: 20-200 nodes typical (larger networks may need filtering or aggregation)
- Example: Social network with 50 nodes representing people and edges representing friendships

## Notes

- Node size can optionally scale by degree (number of connections)
- Edge thickness can optionally represent connection strength or weight
- Use sufficient iterations to allow the layout to stabilize
- Consider node labels only for smaller networks or key nodes to avoid clutter
