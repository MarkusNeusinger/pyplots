review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic context with detailed coastline outlines covering all major
    continents
  - Clear differentiation of route volumes through both color and line thickness
  - Well-designed airport markers that stand out against the background
  - Correct title format following pyplots conventions
  - Good use of Bezier curves to represent flight paths without visual clutter
  weaknesses:
  - Route line colors could have stronger contrast differentiation (teal routes somewhat
    blend with gray coastlines)
  - Transparency/alpha on route lines not clearly visible which would help with overlapping
    routes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map visualization showing international
    flight routes between major airports. The background is a light blue color representing
    ocean, with gray coastline outlines providing geographic context for continents
    and landmasses. Blue circular markers (large, prominent dots) indicate 14 major
    airport locations worldwide including cities like London, New York, Los Angeles,
    Tokyo, Sydney, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Chicago, Beijing, Sao Paulo,
    and Johannesburg. Connection lines between airports show flight routes, colored
    and styled by passenger volume: teal/green thin lines for routes under 2M passengers,
    yellow/gold medium lines for 2-3M passengers, and red/orange thicker lines for
    routes over 3M passengers. The lines are curved (Bezier curves) to represent great
    circle paths. The title "map-connection-lines · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. Axes show Longitude (°) on x-axis from -160 to 160 and Latitude (°) on
    y-axis from -60 to 80. A legend at the bottom shows 5 categories: Coastlines,
    Routes < 2M, Routes 2-3M, Routes > 3M, and Airports.'
