  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with Distribution Summary box, peak callout annotation,
    mean marker, and IQR band — gives the viewer immediate statistical context
  - Strong use of pygal's native Histogram chart type with proper (count, lo, hi)
    tuple format and dual PNG/HTML output
  - Well-crafted custom Style with intentional typography hierarchy, subtle grid styling,
    and polished color palette
  - Realistic exam score scenario using beta distribution for natural-looking left-skewed
    data
  - All font sizes explicitly configured for 4800×2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - The green IQR band renders as a flat rectangle at ~30% of max height, overlapping
    and partially obscuring several histogram bars — consider using a lighter opacity
    or rendering it behind the main bars
  - The red mean marker extends to full histogram height, visually competing with
    data bars — a thinner line or shorter reference marker would be less intrusive
  - PIL-based annotation overlay with hardcoded pixel coordinates (plot_x0=350, plot_x1=4650)
    is fragile and adds external dependency complexity beyond what pygal natively
    offers
  - 25 bins for 500 data points creates somewhat narrow bars in places, making some
    individual bars harder to distinguish
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of exam scores for 500 students
    using pygal''s native Histogram chart type. The main distribution is rendered
    in steel blue (#306998) bars spanning approximately 50 to 95 points on the x-axis,
    with frequency counts on the y-axis reaching up to about 46 students. The distribution
    is left-skewed with the bulk of scores concentrated between 70-90 points. A prominent
    red (#c0392b) narrow vertical bar marks the mean at 77.6 points, extending to
    the full height of the tallest bin. A green (#27ae60) semi-transparent horizontal
    band shows the IQR range from 72-85 points at approximately 30% of max height.
    A white rounded-rectangle annotation box in the upper-left displays "Distribution
    Summary" with mean (77.6), median (78.8), IQR spread (72-85 pts), peak bin (80-81
    pts, 46 students), and skew direction. A blue callout "▼ Peak: 80-81 pts" appears
    above the tallest bar. The legend at the bottom identifies all three series. The
    title "histogram-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Background
    is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: Green IQR band overlaps with histogram bars at fixed height, partially
          obscuring lower portion of several bins. Red mean marker cuts through bars

        comment: Histogram bars well-sized and visible. IQR band at fixed ~30% height
          partially obscures data bars. Mean marker disproportionately tall.
