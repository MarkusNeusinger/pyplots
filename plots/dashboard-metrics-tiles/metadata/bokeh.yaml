review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard layout with 6 metric tiles in a clean 3x2 grid
  - 'Smart color logic: correctly identifies when changes are favorable vs unfavorable
    (e.g., Error Rate increase is red, Response Time decrease is green)'
  - Beautiful sparklines with area fill, line, and current value marker
  - Status indicator bars at top of each tile provide immediate visual status
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (gridplot, ColumnDataSource, Label, patch)
  - Clean, professional appearance suitable for real operations dashboards
  weaknesses:
  - Sparklines could have slightly more visual prominence (thicker lines or larger
    area)
  - The title figure adds extra height that makes total canvas ~4500x2670 instead
    of standard 4800x2700
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3x2 grid of dashboard metric tiles on a light gray background with a centered title at the top reading "dashboard-metrics-tiles · bokeh · pyplots.ai". Each tile contains:
    - A colored status bar at the top (green for good, yellow/orange for warning, red for critical)
    - A metric name label (CPU Usage, Memory, Response Time, Error Rate, Throughput, Active Users)
    - A large prominent value display (45%, 72%, 120ms, 2.4%, 1250req/s, 8432)
    - A change indicator with arrow and percentage in green (favorable) or red (unfavorable)
    - A sparkline chart showing historical trend with blue line, light blue fill area, and a dot marking the current value

    The color coding correctly shows: CPU Usage (green status, red down arrow - favorable decrease), Memory (yellow status, green up arrow), Response Time (green status, green down arrow - favorable decrease), Error Rate (red status, red up arrow - unfavorable increase), Throughput (green status, green up arrow), Active Users (yellow status, red down arrow).
