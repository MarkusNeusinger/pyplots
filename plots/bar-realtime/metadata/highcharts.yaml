review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe blue/orange palette instead of problematic red/green
  - Ghost bars effectively convey the motion effect for real-time visualization
  - Change indicators with delta values provide clear feedback on direction and magnitude
  - Professional subtitle with LIVE indicator adds dashboard authenticity
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: animations, annotations, rounded borders'
  weaknesses:
  - Legend icons display as circles rather than rectangles/bars matching the chart
    type
  - Legend positioned far from the chart in upper-right corner with excessive gap
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time updating bar chart showing service
    throughput metrics (requests per second) for 6 services: API Gateway, Auth Service,
    Database, Cache, Queue, and CDN. Each service has two bars side-by-side: a light
    gray semi-transparent "Previous" bar and a colored "Current" bar. The current
    bars use a colorblind-safe palette with blue (#306998) for increases and orange
    (#E07B39) for decreases. Above each current bar are change indicators showing
    directional arrows (▲/▼) with the absolute change value in matching colors. The
    title "bar-realtime · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the
    top, with a green "● LIVE" subtitle indicating real-time data. The y-axis shows
    "Requests per Second" ranging from 0-500, and the x-axis shows "Service" with
    category labels. A legend in the upper right distinguishes Previous (light blue
    circle) from Current (dark blue circle) series. Data labels on each bar show exact
    values (e.g., 252, 420, 256, 221, 338, 170 for current values).'
