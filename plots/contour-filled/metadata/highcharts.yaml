review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of filled contour using Highcharts heatmap with
    overlaid line series for contour lines
  - 'Creative solution: white contour lines with black shadow for visibility against
    any background color'
  - Colorblind-safe viridis colormap implementation with proper color stops
  - High-quality 4800x2700 resolution with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Contour level annotations (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%) provide precise reference
    points
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations API for contour labels
  weaknesses:
  - Code structure includes helper functions (marching_squares_contour, connect_segments)
    which violates the KISS principle - should be flat script structure
  - Colorbar/legend takes significant right margin space; could be more compact
