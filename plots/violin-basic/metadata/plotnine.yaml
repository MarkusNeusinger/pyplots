review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with four distinct distribution shapes (right-skewed, bimodal,
    tight, wide) that showcase violin plot capabilities
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (quartiles, median, mirrored
    density)
  - Idiomatic plotnine code with clean grammar of graphics composition
  - Good visual quality with explicitly set font sizes and no overlaps
  weaknesses:
  - Design still looks like a well-configured library default rather than a polished
    custom design
  - No visual hierarchy or emphasis to guide the viewer to the most interesting patterns
    (e.g., bimodal Section B)
  - Section names are slightly generic — more evocative labels would improve data
    storytelling
  image_description: The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally, each
    representing a different class section (A through D). Section A (green/teal) shows
    a right-skewed distribution centered around 68-70 with a small bump near 85. Section
    B (orange) displays a clear bimodal distribution with two bulges at approximately
    55 and 82. Section C (blue/lavender) shows a tight, narrow distribution centered
    around 74. Section D (pink) has a wide, spread-out distribution centered around
    70 extending from near 0 to 100. Each violin contains three horizontal lines marking
    the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles. The title reads "violin-basic ·
    plotnine · pyplots.ai", x-axis is "Class Section", and y-axis is "Exam Score (pts)".
    The background is minimal with light gray horizontal grid lines and no vertical
    grid lines. No legend is shown as categories are labeled on the x-axis.
