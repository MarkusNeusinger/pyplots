review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate axis labels with units
  - Good use of canvas space at 4800x2700
  - Realistic stock price data generation with cumulative product approach
  - Proper Kagi algorithm logic for calculating turning points and yang/yin states
  weaknesses:
  - Segments render as disconnected rectangular boxes rather than continuous thick/thin
    lines
  - Yang (thick) vs Yin (thin) line thickness distinction is not visually clear due
    to box rendering
  - Legend entries do not properly connect to the chart series
  - Pink/magenta color for bearish segments is quite light and could be stronger red
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi-style chart with the title "kagi-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Price ($)" ranging from
    approximately 82 to 112, and the X-axis shows "Kagi Line Index" from 0 to 20.
    The chart uses green color for yang (bullish) segments and pink/magenta for yin
    (bearish) segments. A legend at the bottom identifies "Yang (Bullish)" and "Yin
    (Bearish)". Horizontal grid lines are visible. However, the segments appear as
    disconnected rectangular boxes rather than a continuous Kagi line with varying
    thickness - each segment is rendered as a separate closed path forming a rectangle,
    which does not accurately represent the traditional Kagi chart structure of thick
    and thin connected vertical lines with horizontal shoulders/waists.
