review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of rose chart using plotnine polygon geometry approach
  - Clean visual design with subtle gridlines and well-positioned month labels
  - Correct radius-proportional encoding as specified (not area)
  - Proper clockwise arrangement starting from January at 12 o'clock
  - Effective blue-to-yellow color gradient based on rainfall values
  - Good use of gaps between wedges for visual separation
  - Realistic monthly rainfall data with meaningful seasonal variation
  weaknesses:
  - Value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) are positioned only on one spoke, making them
    less visible
  - Figure size is 12x12 at 300 DPI (3600x3600) which is acceptable but the spec prefers
    16x9 for landscape or explicit 3600x3600 for square
  - Could use plotnine built-in theme functions more extensively
  image_description: The plot displays a rose chart (coxcomb diagram) showing monthly
    rainfall data in millimeters. The chart features 12 wedge-shaped segments arranged
    in a clockwise direction starting from January at the top (12 o'clock position).
    Each wedge extends from the center with a radius proportional to the rainfall
    value. The color scheme transitions from blue (lower values like March/April/May
    around 48-55mm) through olive/green tones to yellow (higher values like November
    at 95mm). Radial gridlines are visible as dashed circles at 20, 40, 60, 80, and
    100mm intervals. Spoke lines separate the months. Month labels (Jan, Feb, etc.)
    are positioned outside the chart in bold black text. Value labels (20, 40, 60,
    80, 100) appear along the top spoke. The title "Monthly Rainfall (mm) · rose-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The plot uses a square 1:1 aspect
    ratio with a clean white background.

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_polygon and layered
          construction, but doesn't leverage coord_polar() since plotnine lacks it
          - manual polygon construction is a workaround
  verdict: APPROVED
