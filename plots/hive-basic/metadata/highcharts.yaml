review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot using Highcharts SVGRenderer API for custom
    geometry
  - Interactive tooltips showing node details (label, axis type, connection count)
  - Well-designed legend with both Module Types and Edge Weight visual guide
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between axes
  - Curved Bezier edges with weight-based thickness provide clear visual hierarchy
  - Central hub element adds visual coherence to the radial layout
  - Node labels positioned intelligently based on axis angle to avoid overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python library as recommended in library rules (uses
    raw JS generation instead)
  - Code could benefit from an explicit comment noting deterministic data for reproducibility
