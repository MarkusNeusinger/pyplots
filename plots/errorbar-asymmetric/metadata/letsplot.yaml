quality_score: 93
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized elements and readable text at all levels
  - Clear demonstration of asymmetric error bars with visible caps
  - Proper title format and informative caption explaining the error bounds
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure following lets-plot conventions
  - Good use of theme_minimal() with subtle grid customization
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs as expected for lets-plot
  weaknesses:
  - The interactive HTML version does not include tooltips to show exact values on
    hover
  - Grid/Legend score reduced because there is no formal legend element (caption serves
    the purpose but is not a legend)
