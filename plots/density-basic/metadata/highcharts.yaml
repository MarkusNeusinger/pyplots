review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of KDE from scratch using Gaussian kernel with Silverman's
    bandwidth rule
  - Beautiful gradient fill under the density curve using linearGradient
  - Includes optional rug plot showing individual observations as specified
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow)
  - Bimodal data effectively demonstrates density estimation capabilities
  - Clean Selenium-based PNG export with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled; enabling it would help identify the rug plot vs density curve
  - Y-axis minimum set to -0.002 to show rug plot looks slightly unusual for a density
    plot
  - Grid opacity could be slightly higher (0.2-0.3) for better reference
