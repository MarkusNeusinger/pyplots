review:
  strengths:
  - Well-designed visual with clear Python color scheme (blue/yellow)
  - Good use of transparency for overlapping routes
  - Passenger volume encoded in line width effectively
  - Clean legend explaining traffic levels
  - Appropriate world map projection and axis ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function get_curved_path() - should inline the curve calculation
    logic to follow KISS principle
  - Legend shows categorical labels but actual data is continuous (mismatch)
  - City labels overlap near European cities (London/Paris/Frankfurt)
  - Axis labels lack degree units (should be Longitude (°) and Latitude (°))
  - Limited use of seaborn distinctive features - most visualization done with matplotlib
  image_description: The plot displays a world map with connection lines between major
    international airports. The map shows simplified continent outlines in light gray
    (#E8E8E8) with subtle gray borders. Ten airports are marked as yellow circular
    markers with blue edges at locations including New York, Los Angeles, London,
    Paris, Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Sydney. Blue curved
    lines (quadratic Bezier curves) connect the airports, with line thickness varying
    based on passenger volume. The lines use alpha transparency (0.4) to handle overlapping
    routes. City labels are positioned with an offset to the upper-right of each marker.
    A legend in the lower-left shows "Passenger Volume" with three line thickness
    categories (Low/Medium/High traffic). The title follows the required format "map-connection-lines
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axes show Longitude (-180 to 180) and Latitude (-60 to
    80).
