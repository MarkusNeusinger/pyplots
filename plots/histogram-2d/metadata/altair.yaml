review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with mark_rect and bin encoding for
    2D histogram
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle
  - Proper use of viridis colormap for perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Well-configured font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Colorbar legend properly configured with appropriate sizing
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated as expected
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual with units
  - Could enhance with Altair interactivity features (tooltips showing bin range and
    count)
  - Minor layout imbalance with slightly more whitespace on left side
