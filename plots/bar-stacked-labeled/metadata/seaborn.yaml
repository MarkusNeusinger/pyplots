review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent total label formatting with currency symbol and units ($XXM in bold)
  - Clean white edge highlighting between segments improves readability
  - Good use of sns.despine() for professional appearance
  - Proper vertical space allocation for labels (y-axis extends 15% beyond max)
  - Realistic business data scenario with quarterly revenue breakdown
  weaknesses:
  - Implementation uses matplotlib ax.bar() for stacking rather than seaborn native
    functions - seaborn is only used for despine()
  - Legend positioned in upper left slightly overlaps with the bar area
  - All four product categories show monotonic growth which is somewhat unrealistic
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    (Q1-Q4) by product category. Four stacked segments are shown in each bar: Electronics
    (blue, #306998), Software (yellow, #FFD43B), Services (green, #4CAF50), and Hardware
    (pink/magenta, #E91E63). Total labels appear above each bar stack in bold format
    showing "$123M", "$143M", "$150M", and "$184M" respectively. The y-axis shows
    "Revenue (Millions USD)" ranging from 0 to 200, and the x-axis shows "Quarter"
    with labels Q1-Q4. A legend titled "Product Category" is positioned in the upper
    left. The title follows the correct format "bar-stacked-labeled · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    White edge lines separate the stacked segments, and a subtle horizontal grid is
    visible.'
