review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using seaborn built-in colorblind palette
  - Clear visual hierarchy with prominent value display (72%)
  - Good canvas utilization with the gauge filling most of the vertical space
  - Clean zone labeling integrated directly into the arc segments
  - Proper use of seaborn for scatter/line components and color palette selection
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib wedge patches rather than seaborn native constructs
  - Zone labels (Low/Medium/High) could have better contrast or slight text shadow
    for improved readability on colored backgrounds
  - Needle tip marker could be larger or more prominent to clearly indicate the exact
    value
