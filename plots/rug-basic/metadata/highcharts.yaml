review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data storytelling: clearly shows clustering patterns in API response
    times with visible gaps between fast/medium/slow responses and distinct outliers'
  - Proper use of transparency (alpha 0.6) to handle overlapping tick marks in dense
    regions
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis label with units
  - Realistic, relatable scenario (API response times) that makes the rug plot meaningful
  - Clean visual design with appropriate tick width and color
  weaknesses:
  - Excessive whitespace above the rug marks - the plot area is underutilized with
    ticks only in the bottom quarter of the canvas
  - Creating 93 individual LineSeries (one per data point) is inefficient and makes
    the implementation more complex than necessary
  - Vertical grid lines add visual clutter to a rug plot where the focus should be
    on the tick marks
