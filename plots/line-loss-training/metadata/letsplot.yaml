review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of overfitting concept with training/validation loss divergence
  - Clean implementation of optimal stopping point marker with diamond shape and vertical
    dashed line
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with proper theme customization
  - Appropriate color scheme (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-friendly
  - Proper sizing with ggsize(1600, 900) and scale=3 for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are not visible despite using theme_minimal (could add explicit grid
    with alpha for subtle visibility)
  - The legend shows empty string for color label which works but is not ideal practice
  image_description: 'The plot displays a training loss curve with two lines on a
    light gray gridded background. The blue line represents "Training Loss" starting
    at ~2.5 and decreasing smoothly to ~0.1 by epoch 100. The yellow/gold line represents
    "Validation Loss" starting at ~2.6, decreasing initially but then showing overfitting
    behavior after ~epoch 50, rising to ~0.6 by epoch 100. A vertical red dashed line
    marks the optimal stopping point at approximately epoch 60, with a red diamond
    marker at the minimum validation loss point (~0.4). The title "line-loss-training
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top. The legend is positioned
    at the top, showing "Training Loss" (blue) and "Validation Loss" (yellow). Axes
    are clearly labeled: "Epoch" (x-axis) and "Cross-Entropy Loss" (y-axis).'
