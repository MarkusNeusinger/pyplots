review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density histogram with proper ..density.. stat transformation
  - Clean addition of fitted normal distribution PDF overlay using scipy.stats
  - 'Appropriate color scheme (#306998 blue bars, #FFD43B yellow line) with good contrast'
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-like grammar with theme customization
  - Bimodal data distribution effectively demonstrates density normalization concept
  - Correct figure sizing (1600x900 base with scale=3) and text sizing per library
    guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could specify Test Score points or Density probability
    per unit)
  - A legend explaining the yellow line as Fitted Normal Distribution would add clarity
  - Could leverage more distinctive lets-plot features like scale_fill_* or tooltip
    configuration
