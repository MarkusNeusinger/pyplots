review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot with both filled contours and line contours overlaid
  - Viridis colormap is colorblind-accessible
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good text sizing for readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Bimodal distribution shows interesting contour patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Uses KDE density estimation instead of scalar field z=f(x,y) on meshgrid as the
    spec requires
  - Axis labels are generic without context - should reflect a realistic application
    like topography or temperature
  - Missing labeled contour levels as suggested in the spec notes
  - Data does not demonstrate spec stated applications such as topography or meteorology
    or mathematical functions
  - Whitegrid style is distracting for contour plots - plain or no grid would be better
