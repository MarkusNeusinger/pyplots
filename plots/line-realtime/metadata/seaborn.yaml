review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual communication of real-time concept with LIVE indicator and scroll
    direction arrow
  - Latest value annotation with contrasting yellow background draws attention effectively
  - Alpha gradient fade effect successfully conveys older data visually
  - Proper sliding window implementation showing 60 of 100 generated points
  - Clean title format and axis labels with units
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with appropriate value ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Calling sns.lineplot 59 times in a loop is inefficient; consider using matplotlib
    LineCollection for gradient or a single seaborn call with post-processing
  - Data lacks dramatic variation - mostly hovers around 35-50% with only one visible
    spike
