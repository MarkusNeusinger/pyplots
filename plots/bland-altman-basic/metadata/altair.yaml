review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all required Bland-Altman components (mean bias line,
    limits of agreement, annotations)
  - Clean declarative Altair code using proper layering of chart elements
  - Good use of tooltips for interactive exploration of data points
  - Realistic medical device validation scenario with appropriate blood pressure data
  - Color scheme provides good contrast between data points (blue) and limit lines
    (yellow)
  - Annotations are well-positioned and clearly formatted with values
  weaknesses:
  - Grid configuration uses gridOpacity=0.3 which is acceptable but could have legend
    explaining the reference lines for publication quality
  - No formal legend element present, though annotations compensate for this
  image_description: The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement plot comparing two
    blood pressure measurement methods. Blue circular scatter points (#306998 Python
    blue) with moderate transparency (alpha 0.7) represent 80 paired observations.
    A solid dark blue horizontal line at y = -2.44 indicates the mean bias. Two dashed
    yellow/gold lines at y = +6.55 and y = -11.44 mark the 95% limits of agreement
    (±1.96 SD). The x-axis shows "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" ranging from approximately
    80-160, and the y-axis shows "Difference (Method 1 - Method 2) (mmHg)" ranging
    from about -18 to 10. The title "bland-altman-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. Annotations for each reference line appear on the right side of the
    plot. The grid is subtle with light gray lines.
