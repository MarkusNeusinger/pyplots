review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram from scratch using Bokeh low-level
    primitives (patch, quad)
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-sized text elements and appropriate transparency
    for flows
  - Good use of subtitle to explain the data context and units
  - Proper color coding with colors following source category for intuitive flow tracking
  - Clean KISS-style code with inline Bezier curve calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Interactive features like HoverTool could enhance the Bokeh implementation
  - Legend is positioned far right creating slight visual imbalance
  - Node labels only shown for first and last time points; middle time points could
    benefit from value annotations
