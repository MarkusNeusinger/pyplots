review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data selection with 24 realistic, well-categorized technology innovations
    across 4 sectors and 4 time horizons
  - Correct use of pygal.Radar with concentric rings mapping to time horizons and
    angular sectors mapping to categories
  - Clever one-series-per-item workaround to achieve per-ring color coding within
    pygal's API constraints
  - All font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700 canvas, ensuring readability
  - Clean legend with descriptive time-horizon labels (Adopt Now, Trial 6-12 mo, etc.)
  weaknesses:
  - Individual innovation names are not displayed as text labels on the dots — the
    spec explicitly requires labeled points with readable labels, making the dots
    anonymous and the chart uninformative at a glance
  - Colors encode ring/time-horizon instead of sector/category — the spec says Color-code
    points by sector/category and include a legend mapping colors/markers to categories
  - Green (#27ae60) and red (#c0392b) used together are not colorblind-safe; a palette
    avoiding red-green distinction is needed
  - numpy is imported but never meaningfully used (seed is set but no random generation
    occurs)
  - Significant whitespace below the radar and above the legend wastes canvas space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar chart with the title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. Four sector labels are positioned at
    the cardinal directions: "AI & ML" (top), "Biotech & Health" (right, rotated 90°),
    "Sustainability" (bottom), and "Cloud & Infra" (left, rotated 90°). Four concentric
    dashed elliptical rings represent time horizons, labeled along the vertical axis
    as "Adopt" (innermost), "Trial", "Assess", and "Hold" (outermost). Twenty-four
    colored dots are scattered across the radar: green (#27ae60) for Adopt, blue (#2980b9)
    for Trial, orange (#e67e22) for Assess, and red (#c0392b) for Hold. A four-item
    legend at the bottom maps colors to ring categories with time descriptions: "Adopt
    (Now)", "Trial (6-12 mo)", "Assess (1-2 yr)", "Hold (2-5 yr)". Notably, individual
    innovation names (e.g., "LLM Agents", "Kubernetes") are NOT displayed as text
    labels on the dots — only anonymous colored dots appear. The background is white
    with a clean, sparse layout and significant whitespace below the chart.'
