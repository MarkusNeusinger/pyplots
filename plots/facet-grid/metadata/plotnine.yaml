review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3x3 facet grid demonstrating plotnine grammar of graphics with facet_grid
  - Well-chosen plant growth study context with clear patterns across soil types and
    light levels
  - Good use of Set2 colorblind-safe palette with appropriate alpha for point visibility
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper categorical ordering
  - Title correctly formatted as facet-grid · plotnine · pyplots.ai
  - Axis labels include units (mL/day, cm) for clarity
  - Facet strip labels use label_both for clear identification of row/column variables
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
