review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario (manufacturing efficiency with diminishing returns)
    that perfectly demonstrates polynomial regression
  - R² value and polynomial equation are prominently displayed with clear formatting
  - Good color contrast between scatter points (blue) and regression curve (yellow)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom right is far from the main data area; would be better
    near the annotation or top-left
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive point inspection which is a key Bokeh strength
  - Annotation text size (22pt) is adequate but could be larger (24-26pt) for better
    visibility at full resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 100 blue data points (#306998)
    representing manufacturing efficiency gains (%) against investment (thousands
    $). A smooth yellow polynomial regression curve (#FFD43B) fits through the data,
    clearly showing the diminishing returns pattern - efficiency gains increase rapidly
    at first then taper off. The R² value (0.9765) and polynomial equation (y = -0.0047x²
    + 1.17x + 20.07) are annotated in the upper-middle area with a white background.
    The title "scatter-regression-polynomial · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top left. Axis labels include units ("Investment (thousands $)" and "Efficiency
    Gain (%)"). A legend in the bottom right shows "Data Points" and "Polynomial Fit
    (degree 2)". The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines.

          corner which is far from the main data concentration; legend could be better
          placed

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and Label annotation which are Bokeh-specific,
          but doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive features like HoverTool which would
          show point values on hover
  verdict: APPROVED
