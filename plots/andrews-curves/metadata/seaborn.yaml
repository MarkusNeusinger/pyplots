review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation algorithm
  - Perfect use of seaborn lineplot with units parameter to plot individual curves
    without aggregation
  - Good choice of colorblind-safe color palette with appropriate transparency
  - Clean separation of species clusters visible in the visualization
  - Correct mathematical notation for x-axis labels using π symbols
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels use mathematical notation only (t, f(t)) without descriptive context
    for newcomers
  - Legend could be positioned to avoid any potential overlap with curve endpoints
