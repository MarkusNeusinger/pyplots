review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper aesthetics mapping for
    color, alpha, and size
  - Clear visual distinction between raw data (lighter blue, thin line) and rolling
    average (prominent yellow, thicker line)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of scale_alpha_manual and scale_size_manual for visual differentiation
  - Well-structured data transformation to long format for ggplot-style plotting
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels are slightly crowded with 7-day breaks over 6 months - could
    use monthly breaks for cleaner appearance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series of daily temperature data from
    January 2024 to July 2024. The raw daily temperature data is shown as a thin blue/gray
    line with semi-transparency (alpha ~0.5), exhibiting significant day-to-day fluctuations
    typical of temperature readings. Overlaid on top is a prominent yellow/golden
    line representing the 7-day rolling average, which is thicker and fully opaque.
    The chart shows a clear seasonal trend: temperatures start near 0°C in January,
    rise steadily through spring, peak around 20-25°C in late April/May, and begin
    declining into summer. The title "line-timeseries-rolling · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. X-axis shows dates labeled by month (Jan 2024, Feb 2024, etc.)
    with rotated labels. Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately
    -5 to 28. A legend on the right distinguishes "Daily Temperature" and "7-Day Rolling
    Average". The grid is subtle with light gray lines.'
