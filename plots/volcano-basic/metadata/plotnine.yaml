review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the volcano plot specification with all required features
    (threshold lines, color coding, gene labels)
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach using plotnine ggplot2-style syntax
  - Good data simulation that realistically represents differential gene expression
    results
  - Text sizes properly configured for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper use of categorical coloring with meaningful significance categories
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap between Gene_469 and Gene_478 on the right side of the plot
  - Could use colorblind-safe palette instead of red-blue (consider using orange or
    different saturation)
  - Grid lines not visible (theme_minimal removes them) which could aid reading values
