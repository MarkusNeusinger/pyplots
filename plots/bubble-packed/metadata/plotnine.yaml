review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of circle packing algorithm with force simulation for
    tight packing
  - Area-based scaling (sqrt) correctly used for accurate visual perception per spec
  - Colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette provides excellent accessibility
  - Smart label handling with full/truncated/abbreviated text based on circle size
  - Clean code structure with well-organized packing algorithm inline
  weaknesses:
  - Label truncation cuts off Engineering to Engineerin and Customer Service to Customer
    S which loses readability
  - No distinctive plotnine grammar of graphics features used - relies heavily on
    manual polygon construction
