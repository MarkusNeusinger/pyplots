review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation from scratch showing clear community
    clustering
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition (edges + nodes + labels)
  - Effective degree-based node sizing that highlights well-connected individuals
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between communities
  - Proper tooltip integration for interactive exploration
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels at 12pt could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Some label overlap in densely connected areas (Noah/Mia/Olivia region)
  - Could leverage Altair interactive selection features for highlighting connected
    nodes
