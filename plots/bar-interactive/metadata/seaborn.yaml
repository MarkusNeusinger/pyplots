review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent tooltip-style annotations displaying mean, std, and percentage for each
    bar
  - Good use of seaborn statistical features (error bars with SD)
  - Sequential colormap with colorbar effectively encodes value magnitude
  - Clean visual presentation with proper font sizes and despined axes
  - Title follows correct format specification
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is a static library so true hover/click interactivity is not achievable
    - annotations are a reasonable workaround
  - Annotation boxes partially overlap with error bars on some bars (Electronics)
  - Missing dollar sign prefix in annotation values inconsistent with axis label formatting
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a bar chart showing sales revenue across 6 product categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, and Toys. The bars are arranged in descending order by value from left to right.

    Colors: The bars use a sequential Blues colormap where Electronics (highest, ~$5,024) is dark blue and Toys (lowest, ~$1,473) is very light blue. A vertical colorbar on the right side labeled "Sales Magnitude ($)" explains the color intensity encoding, ranging from approximately 1,500 to 5,000.

    Annotations: Each bar has a white tooltip-style box positioned above it containing the mean value ± standard deviation and the percentage of total sales. For example, Electronics shows "$5,024±281 (31.3% of total)". The annotations have rounded corners with gray borders.

    Error bars: Black error bars extend from the top of each bar showing the standard deviation.

    Axes: The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" (fontsize 20), the y-axis is labeled "Sales Revenue ($)" (fontsize 20) with values ranging from 0 to 7,000. The title "bar-interactive · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top (fontsize 24, bold).

    Layout: The plot has a clean appearance with subtle horizontal grid lines (alpha 0.3, dashed) and despined axes (no top or right borders). The plot fills approximately 70% of the canvas with balanced margins.
