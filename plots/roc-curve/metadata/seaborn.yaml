review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and well-contrasted line colors
  - Complete spec compliance including diagonal reference line, AUC annotations, and
    correct title format
  - Realistic machine learning context comparing three classifiers with believable
    performance differences
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Equal aspect ratio makes the curve shapes easy to interpret correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Uses seaborn minimally - only lineplot and styling, which does not showcase seaborn
    distinctive features
  - Yellow/gold color for Logistic Regression could be slightly harder to distinguish
    for colorblind viewers
  image_description: 'The plot displays an ROC curve visualization with three model
    curves and a diagonal reference line. The title "roc-curve · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. The X-axis shows "False Positive Rate (FPR)"
    from 0.0 to 1.0, and the Y-axis shows "True Positive Rate (TPR)" from 0.0 to 1.0
    with equal aspect ratio. Three ROC curves are displayed: Random Forest in blue
    (AUC = 0.967), Logistic Regression in yellow/gold (AUC = 0.714), and Decision
    Tree in red (AUC = 0.642). A gray dashed diagonal line represents the Random Classifier
    (AUC = 0.500). The legend is positioned in the lower right corner with good readability.
    The background uses a white grid with subtle dashed lines.'

        comment: Only uses sns.lineplot and sns.set_style/set_context. This is basic
          seaborn usage - lineplot is not a distinctive seaborn feature. Could have
          used seaborn's color palettes more effectively or its statistical visualization
          features.
  verdict: APPROVED
