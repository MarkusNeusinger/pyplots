review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimalist lollipop chart that perfectly matches the spec description
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for high-resolution
    output
  - Good use of plotly Graph Objects for precise control over stems and markers
  - Hover template provides formatted dollar values for interactivity
  - Data is properly sorted descending for easy comparison
  - White marker borders provide nice visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Data values are too perfectly rounded (all multiples of 1000) - more realistic
    data would have varied precision
  - Could leverage more plotly-specific features like custom hover modes or improved
    interactivity
