review:
  strengths:
  - 'Comprehensive feature set: cumulative line, threshold lines, elbow detection,
    individual variance overlay — exceeds spec requirements'
  - Excellent data storytelling with annotations at key decision points (elbow, threshold
    crossings)
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between series
  - Strong use of pygal-specific features (secondary axis, per-point formatters, cubic
    interpolation, fill)
  - Clean, deterministic data based on realistic Wine-like PCA eigenvalue distribution
  - Thoroughly customized Style object with explicit font sizes for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text crowding in the threshold annotation region (90% and 95% labels overlap
    slightly)
  - Individual variance dot size (6) could be slightly larger for better visibility
    at this canvas resolution
  - Secondary y-axis scale not visible on the right side, making it hard to read individual
    variance values from the axis itself
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative explained variance curve for PCA
    component selection using a pygal line chart at 4800x2700 resolution. The main
    cumulative variance line is rendered in blue with area fill underneath, rising
    from approximately 40% at component 1 to ~100% at component 13 with cubic interpolation
    producing a smooth curve. Large dot markers appear at each integer component.
    Individual variance percentages (steel blue line on a secondary axis) show a declining
    pattern from 36.7% (PC1) down through 19.5%, 11.3%, 7.1%, 6.6%, 5.0%, 4.3%, with
    labels suppressed below 3%. Two horizontal dashed reference lines mark the 90%
    threshold (purple dashed) and 95% threshold (teal/green dotted), with annotations
    indicating "90% threshold (n=7)" and "95% threshold (n=9)". An "Elbow (75%)" annotation
    appears near component 4. The background is white with a light gray-blue (#F7F9FC)
    plot area. The legend at the bottom lists four series in a single row. Axis labels
    read "Number of Components" (x) and "Cumulative Explained Variance (%)" (y), with
    y-axis ticks at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 100 where 90 and 95 are major labels.
