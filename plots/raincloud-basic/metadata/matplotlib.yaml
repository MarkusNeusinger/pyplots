review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud visual metaphor with cloud (half-violin)
    on top, boxplot in middle, and rain (jittered points) below
  - Manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule demonstrates solid understanding
    of the underlying statistics
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment A clearly visible, showcasing the key advantage
    of raincloud plots over boxplots
  - Clean, readable code structure with helpful comments
  - Appropriate color choices that are accessible and visually distinct
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is redundant since the y-axis already shows category labels; consider removing
    legend or making it show components (cloud, boxplot, rain) instead
  - Could leverage scipy.stats.gaussian_kde for cleaner KDE implementation rather
    than manual calculation
