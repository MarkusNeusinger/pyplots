review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme with consistent lighter shades for child levels
  - Clean visual separation between levels using white strokes
  - Proper tooltips showing Department, Team, Project, and Budget values
  - Well-structured data representing realistic company budget scenario
  - Inner segment labels are bold and readable
  - Proper use of Altair layering to combine multiple arc charts
  weaknesses:
  - Labels only appear on innermost ring; middle and outer rings lack visible text
    labels (rely on hover tooltips)
  - Legend positioned far from chart, creating visual imbalance
  - Could benefit from more interactive features like click-to-zoom that Altair supports
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sunburst chart with three concentric rings
    representing a hierarchical company budget breakdown. The innermost ring shows
    4 departments (Engineering, Operations, Marketing, Sales) with white bold text
    labels positioned at the center of each arc. The middle ring displays teams within
    each department using lighter shades of the parent department color. The outermost
    ring shows projects with the lightest color shades. Engineering (Python Blue #306998)
    occupies the largest segment, followed by Sales (Coral), Marketing (Yellow), and
    Operations (Teal). White stroke lines clearly separate all segments. A legend
    is positioned on the right side listing the four departments. The title "sunburst-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.'
