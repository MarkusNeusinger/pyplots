review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive hierarchical data structure with 3 levels (country → state → city)
  - Well-designed HTML version with true interactive drill-down, breadcrumbs, and
    tooltips
  - 'Good color scheme using Python-branded colors (#306998, #FFD43B)'
  - Continent outline polygons provide geographic context effectively
  - Clean coordinate mapping and proper fixed aspect ratio
  weaknesses:
  - Australia label is cut off at the edge ("Austra")
  - European country labels (UK, Germany, France) overlap and are difficult to read
  - Code contains a function definition (value_to_color) which violates KISS structure
    requirement
  - PNG version does not demonstrate lets-plot distinctive features; HTML uses external
    Leaflet.js library instead of lets-plot native interactivity
  - Two separate legends for size and fill when they represent the same data dimension
  image_description: The plot displays a static world map showing global sales data
    for 8 countries using a bubble marker approach. Simplified continent outlines
    (North America, South America, Europe, Australia) are rendered as light gray polygons
    providing geographic context. Each country is represented by a circular marker
    positioned at approximate geographic coordinates, with both size and fill color
    encoding sales values in millions of dollars. The United States has the largest,
    darkest blue bubble (~$4.85M), followed by Germany (~$2.35M) and United Kingdom
    (~$2.1M). Smaller yellow bubbles represent lower-value countries like Mexico and
    Australia. Country name labels appear below each marker. A dual legend on the
    right shows both the color gradient scale (yellow to blue) and size scale for
    "Sales (Millions $)". The title correctly follows the format "map-drilldown-geographic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Global Sales · Click to drill down (HTML)".
    The background is a light blue-gray (#f0f4f8).

        comment: Implementation creates custom HTML with Leaflet.js rather than using
          lets-plot native interactive capabilities. PNG uses basic geoms without
          distinctive lets-plot features.
