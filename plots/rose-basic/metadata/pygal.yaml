review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Excellent realistic data scenario (monthly rainfall with natural seasonal variation)
  - Proper title format and good color choice (Python blue)
  - Correct canvas sizing (3600x3600 square) appropriate for circular chart
  - Good use of pygal Style customization
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Wrong chart type - This creates a radar/spider chart (polygon connecting
    points) instead of a rose/coxcomb chart (wedge-shaped segments with varying radii).
    A rose chart should look like a pie chart where each slice has equal angle but
    different radius based on value.'
  - Legend placement is isolated in the bottom-left with excessive whitespace around
    the chart
  - Month order appears to go counter-clockwise (Jan-Feb-Mar on left side) which is
    unconventional - time typically flows clockwise
  - Pygal may not support true rose charts natively; if not feasible, should be marked
    as not-feasible for this library
