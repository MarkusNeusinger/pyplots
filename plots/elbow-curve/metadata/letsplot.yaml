review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly scaled text elements for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clear elbow point highlighting using contrasting yellow diamond marker and vertical
    dashed line
  - Proper implementation of lets-plot grammar of graphics with layered geoms
  - Clean KISS code structure following project guidelines
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - No legend or annotation text explaining what the yellow marker/line represents
    (the optimal k value)
  - Could use lets-plot interactive features like tooltips showing exact values on
    hover
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha currently at 0.5, could be 0.3)
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering. It shows
    a line chart with blue circular markers at each data point, connected by a smooth
    blue line. The x-axis is labeled "Number of Clusters (k)" ranging from 1 to 10,
    and the y-axis is labeled "Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)" ranging from
    approximately 1,000 to 13,000. A vertical dashed yellow line marks k=4 as the
    optimal elbow point, with a yellow diamond marker highlighting that specific data
    point. The title "elbow-curve · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold.
    The curve clearly demonstrates the characteristic elbow shape with sharp decrease
    from k=1 to k=4, then diminishing returns afterward. The background is clean with
    subtle gray grid lines and a minimal theme.

        comment: Grid is appropriate but no legend present; while no legend is strictly
          needed, the elbow point annotation could benefit from a small legend explaining
          the yellow marker
