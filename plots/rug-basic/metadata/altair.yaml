  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data choice that clearly demonstrates clustering patterns and
    gaps, fulfilling the spec core purpose
  - Proper use of Altair declarative grammar with mark_rule and y/y2 encoding to create
    tick marks
  - Good semi-transparency (opacity=0.6) to handle overlapping points in dense regions
  - Clean, simple code structure following KISS principles
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with proper scale_factor for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Measurement Value lacks units (could be more specific like Response
    Time (ms) for a realistic scenario)
  - Large empty space above rug marks reduces canvas utilization, though inherent
    to standalone rug plots
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic rug plot with vertical blue tick marks
    (#306998 color with 0.6 opacity) positioned at the bottom of the chart along the
    x-axis. The x-axis is labeled "Measurement Value" and ranges from 6 to 80. The
    tick marks clearly demonstrate a bimodal distribution: a dense cluster of marks
    around values 14-32 and a sparser cluster around 45-68, with a visible gap between
    the two clusters (around 36-42). The title "rug-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is
    displayed at the top in appropriately sized font. The plot uses semi-transparency
    which helps distinguish overlapping tick marks in dense regions.'
