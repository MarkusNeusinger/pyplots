review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's xOffset encoding for clean side-by-side grouping
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal) with good contrast
  - Comprehensive data generation showing realistic performance distributions with
    varied means, standard deviations, and intentional outliers
  - Proper customization of boxplot mark with white median lines and appropriately
    sized outliers
  - Clean declarative code structure following Altair best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned with default orient=right places it somewhat isolated from the
    plot area
  - Grid styling uses gridDash which works but default subtle grid might be cleaner
  - Could add tooltips for interactivity since Altair excels at this
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot comparing employee performance
    scores across four departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support). Within
    each department, three side-by-side box plots represent experience levels: Junior
    (deep blue #306998), Mid (yellow #FFD43B), and Senior (teal #4ECDC4). The y-axis
    shows "Performance Score (%)" ranging from 0 to 105. Each box plot shows the median
    (white horizontal line), interquartile range (box), whiskers extending to ~1.5×IQR,
    and outliers as hollow circles. A legend on the right identifies the experience
    levels. The title "box-grouped · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The plot demonstrates clear progression where Senior employees consistently score
    higher than Mid, who score higher than Junior across all departments.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding with xOffset for grouping, mark_boxplot
          with customization (median stroke, outlier size), but could leverage more
          interactive features or tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
