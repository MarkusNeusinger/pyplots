review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts errorbar series with proper whisker styling (caps
    visible)
  - Clear subtitle explaining what error bars represent (±1 SD) as required by spec
  - Professional appearance with colorblind-safe color palette
  - Properly downloads and inlines Highcharts JS for headless rendering
  - Clean separation between bar series and errorbar series
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears to only show Mean Value entry; the Error series legend entry is
    not visible in the rendered image
  - Could demonstrate asymmetric error bars to fully showcase the capability mentioned
    in spec
