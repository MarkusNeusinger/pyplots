review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PCA biplot with clear visual separation of species
    groups
  - Smart use of Plotly annotations for arrowheads with proper scaling relative to
    score points
  - Carefully positioned variable labels with manual offsets to prevent overlap
  - Clean axis labels showing variance explained percentages as required by spec
  - Professional layout with proper font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Interactive HTML output leverages Plotly strengths
  weaknesses:
  - 'Color palette issue: Setosa and Virginica use similar blue tones, making the
    legend potentially confusing - should use more distinct colors'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a PCA biplot using the Iris dataset with 150
    data points distributed across three species groups: Setosa (blue), Versicolor
    (yellow), and Virginica (also blue - appears same color as Setosa). The scatter
    points show clear separation with Setosa clustered on the left (negative PC1)
    and Versicolor/Virginica overlapping on the right (positive PC1). Four loading
    vectors (arrows) originate from the origin: "sepal width" points upward-left,
    while "sepal length," "petal width," and "petal length" point toward the right.
    Each arrow is labeled with the feature name. Axes show PC1 (73.0%) on x-axis and
    PC2 (22.9%) on y-axis. The title follows the correct format "biplot-pca · plotly
    · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left shows the three species groups. The
    layout is clean with a white background and subtle gray gridlines.'
