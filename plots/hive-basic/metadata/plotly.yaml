review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept using Plotly scatter traces and
    bezier curves
  - Software dependency network is a perfect real-world application for hive plots
  - Good use of transparency for edge bundling to handle visual complexity
  - Degree-based node sizing and positioning effectively communicates node importance
  - Interactive hover templates provide useful information (module name and degree)
  - Color scheme is distinctive and colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels at axis endpoints overlap with axis category labels (formatter/UTILITY,
    grpc/INTERFACE)
  - Output dimensions (1200x1200 with scale=3 = 3600x3600) differs from library guide
    recommendation (1600x900 with scale=3 = 4800x2700)
