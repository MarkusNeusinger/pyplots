review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the frequency polygon concept with proper bin alignment
    across all groups
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of semi-transparent fills that allow all distributions to be compared
  - Good marker styling with white edges for visibility
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario (heights by age group)
  - Lines properly extended to zero at both ends to close the polygon shape
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the blue distribution peak area - could be positioned
    outside plot area or in a less congested corner
  - Color palette while distinguishable, could use a more colorblind-optimized palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a frequency polygon comparing height distributions
    across three age groups. Three lines with semi-transparent fills are shown: a
    blue line with light blue fill for Young Adults (18-25) peaking around 172-175
    cm with frequency ~45, a yellow/gold line with pale yellow fill for Middle-Aged
    (40-50) peaking around 165-170 cm with frequency ~34, and a brown line with tan
    fill for Seniors (65+) peaking around 160-165 cm with frequency ~34. Each line
    has circular markers at data points with white edges. The x-axis shows "Height
    (cm)" ranging from ~135 to 210 cm. The y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to 45.
    A subtle dashed grid is visible. The legend is positioned in the upper right corner.
    The title follows the correct format. The distributions show realistic shifts
    in central tendency across age groups, with young adults being tallest and seniors
    shortest, and increasing spread (variance) with age.'
