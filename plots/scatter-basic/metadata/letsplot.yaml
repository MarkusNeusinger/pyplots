review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate use of theme_minimal() and custom text sizing
  - Good alpha transparency (0.7) for revealing overlapping points
  - Proper PNG export with 3x scale for high resolution
  - Also exports interactive HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels display as generic X Value and Y Value instead of descriptive labels
    with units
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot
  - No use of lets-plot distinctive interactive features like tooltips
  - Point size could be slightly larger for ~120 data points
