review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn split violin feature with inner quartile markers
  - Highly realistic and relevant data scenario (salary by gender/department)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Professional color palette with good contrast and accessibility
  - Well-formatted currency axis labels
  - Title follows exact spec format
  weaknesses:
  - Distribution shapes are relatively similar across all groups - more variety would
    better showcase split violin comparative power
  - Only horizontal grid lines present
  image_description: 'The plot displays four split violin plots arranged horizontally,
    one for each department (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance). Each violin
    is split vertically down the center, with the left half (dark blue, #306998) representing
    Male salary distribution and the right half (golden yellow, #FFD43B) representing
    Female distribution. The violins show smooth kernel density estimates with inner
    quartile markers (dashed horizontal lines at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles).
    The y-axis shows Annual Salary ($) ranging from ~$20K to ~$160K with proper currency
    formatting. Engineering shows the highest salaries (~$90K-$100K median), followed
    by Finance (~$80K-$85K), Marketing (~$72K-$78K), and Sales (~$65K-$72K). A clear
    legend in the upper right identifies the Gender groups. The title correctly follows
    the format ''violin-split · seaborn · pyplots.ai''.'

        comment: Uses seaborn's violinplot with split=True and inner='quart', hue
          parameter, and palette. Good usage but could leverage more seaborn features
          like set_theme() or additional statistical annotations.
  verdict: APPROVED
