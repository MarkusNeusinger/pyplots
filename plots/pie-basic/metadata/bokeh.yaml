review:
  strengths:
  - 'All spec requirements fully met: percentage labels, distinct colors, legend,
    and exploded largest slice'
  - Cloud infrastructure market share is an excellent, realistic, and neutral data
    context
  - All text sizes explicitly set at appropriate scales for the 3600x3600 canvas
  - 'Clean visual refinement: axes/grid hidden, white separators, exploded slice for
    emphasis'
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages bokeh web-native strengths
  weaknesses:
  - No data storytelling or annotations — add callouts highlighting key insights (e.g.,
    AWS leading, Others category being surprisingly large)
  - Red and green slices are adjacent — swap to a fully colorblind-safe palette avoiding
    red-green adjacency
  - Layout has wasted space between pie and legend — tighten vertical spacing or reposition
    legend closer
  - Code is verbose with manual per-wedge loops — consider using ColumnDataSource
    for more idiomatic bokeh
  - Visual design is competent but generic — could benefit from subtle gradient effects,
    shadow, or stronger visual hierarchy to elevate beyond a standard pie chart
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic pie chart on a square (3600x3600 px)
    canvas with the title "pie-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. There
    are 5 wedge slices representing cloud infrastructure market share: AWS (31%, deep
    blue #306998), Azure (25%, yellow #FFD43B), Google Cloud (11%, red #E74C3C), Alibaba
    (4%, green #27AE60), and Others (29%, purple #9B59B6). The AWS slice is slightly
    exploded outward for emphasis. Each slice has a bold percentage label — white
    text on darker slices and dark text on the yellow Azure slice. White separator
    lines (5px) divide the slices. A horizontal legend at the bottom displays category
    names with percentages. The background is white with no axes or grid visible.
    There is noticeable empty space between the bottom of the pie and the legend area.'
