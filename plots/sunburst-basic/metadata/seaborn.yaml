review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sunburst visualization with three clear hierarchical levels (Department
    > Team > Project)
  - Smart use of seaborn light_palette() to create color gradients showing parent-child
    relationships within each branch
  - Effective dual-view layout combining sunburst with summary bar chart using seaborn
    barplot
  - Clear labeling with conditional display based on segment size to avoid clutter
  - Center annotation shows total budget, providing immediate context
  - Good color differentiation between branches (blue, yellow, light blue)
  - Professional styling with sns.set_theme() for consistent poster-quality output
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should use interpunct (·) separator per spec - currently correct
    but data label is prepended
  - Some outer ring labels (CI/CD, Database, Mobile) appear cramped or partially overlap
    with wedge edges
  - The bar chart colors do not match the sunburst branch colors (Engineering shows
    blue in sunburst but bar chart has different mapping due to hue parameter)
