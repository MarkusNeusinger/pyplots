quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, error bars, color
    gradient, zero reference line'
  - 'Clean use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, linear_cmap, Whisker
    model'
  - Great choice of realistic housing price prediction context with 15 meaningful
    feature names
  - Proper sorting logic with highest importance at top
  - Good visual hierarchy with darker blues for more important features
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label lacks units (e.g., Mean Decrease in R² Score would be more informative)
  - Error bar caps (upper_head/lower_head) are set to None - small T-shaped caps would
    improve visibility
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show exact values
    on hover
