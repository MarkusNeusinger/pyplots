review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex network diagram with clear visual hierarchy
  - Route labels with white background boxes and colored borders provide excellent
    readability
  - Curved edges for bidirectional routes elegantly handle overlapping paths
  - Color coding by route type is intuitive and accessible
  - Manual label positioning (t_pos, offset) shows careful attention to avoiding overlaps
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function get_route_color() which violates strict KISS code structure
  - Minor label congestion near Central station where multiple routes converge
  - Grid may be unnecessary for this type of network visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static transport network diagram representing
    a regional rail system with 9 stations. Station nodes are rendered as white circles
    with blue borders, positioned in a roughly radial layout around a central hub
    ("Central"). Each station is labeled below its node in bold black text (Central,
    North, East, South, West, Airport, University, Harbor, Old Town). Routes are shown
    as curved directed arrows with arrowheads indicating travel direction. Three route
    types are distinguished by color: Regional Express (RE) in Python Blue (#306998),
    Airport Service (AIR) in Python Yellow (#FFD43B), and S-Bahn (S) in Sea Green
    (#2E8B57). Each route edge has a white label box with colored border displaying
    the route ID and times (e.g., "RE1 06:00→06:18"). The legend in the upper left
    identifies all three route types. Axis labels describe relative position (West→East
    and South→North). A subtle dashed grid is visible. The title uses the correct
    format "network-transport-static · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'

          for custom shapes, annotate with bbox - good but not exceptional use of
