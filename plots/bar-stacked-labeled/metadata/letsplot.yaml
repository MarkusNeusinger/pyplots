review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with clean layer composition
  - Total labels are bold and prominently displayed with proper currency formatting
    ($XXM)
  - Good color scheme with distinguishable segments
  - Proper handling of lets-plot output directory quirk
  - Clean theme with appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title says Product Category while data column is Product - minor cosmetic
    inconsistency
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    (Q1-Q4) broken down by three product categories: Electronics (blue/teal), Software
    (yellow), and Services (green). Each bar is properly stacked with the segments
    clearly visible. Total labels appear above each bar in bold black text with dollar
    formatting (e.g., "$95M", "$112M", "$114M", "$131M"). The title reads "Quarterly
    Revenue by Product · bar-stacked-labeled · lets-plot · pyplots.ai". The Y-axis
    shows "Revenue (Millions USD)" with values from 0-130, and the X-axis shows "Quarter"
    with Q1-Q4 labels. A legend on the right identifies the three product categories.
    The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gridlines.'
