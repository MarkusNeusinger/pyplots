review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pd.Categorical for logical ordering of response categories instead
    of alphabetical
  - Clean implementation of count labels using geom_text with proper positioning
  - Custom color palette transitions well from blue (positive) to yellow (negative)
    matching sentiment
  - Perfect adherence to KISS code structure with clear section organization
  - Appropriate use of theme_minimal with customized element_text sizing for high-resolution
    output
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Yellow bar color (#FFD43B) on white background has slightly reduced contrast
    compared to blue bars'
