review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of icicle chart using geom_rect and manual position calculation
  - Smart label visibility logic based on rectangle width and label length
  - Good color scheme using Python brand colors that distinguishes hierarchy levels
    clearly
  - Clean white borders effectively separate adjacent rectangles
  - Appropriate font sizing by level for better readability
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: should be "icicle-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" without
    the "File System" prefix'
  - Some wasted whitespace on right and bottom of canvas could be better utilized
  - '"Personal" label at level 2 is missing from the visible output (rectangle exists
    but label hidden)'
