review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of hierarchical clustering (scipy) to create meaningful clusters
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good category differentiation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  - Good use of plotnine grammar with layered geoms
  - Realistic store location scenario on US West Coast
  - Appropriate canvas utilization and layout
  weaknesses:
  - Significant cluster overlap in dense regions makes individual cluster counts hard
    to read
  - Missing geographic basemap context (streets, boundaries) - though this is a plotnine
    limitation
  - 'Legend shows Category: Retail only for individual points, creating confusion
    with Cluster Category legend'
  - No units on axis labels (should be Longitude degrees and Latitude degrees)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered marker map showing US West Coast
    store locations. The visualization shows four distinct geographic clusters corresponding
    to Seattle (~47.5°N), Portland (~45°N), San Francisco (~38°N), and Los Angeles/San
    Diego area (~33-35°N). Clusters are represented as colored circles with white
    text labels showing the count of points within each cluster. Colors represent
    four categories: Retail (blue), Restaurant (yellow/gold), Service (light blue),
    and Entertainment (gray). The cluster sizes vary from small (2-5 points) to larger
    circles (10-20+ points), with size mapped to count. Individual markers appear
    as small blue dots for single-point clusters. The plot has a light gray background
    with subtle grid lines. Three legends appear on the right: "Category" (showing
    only Retail), "Cluster Category" (showing all four categories), and "Points in
    Cluster" (showing size scale 5-20). Title follows the correct format at the top.'
