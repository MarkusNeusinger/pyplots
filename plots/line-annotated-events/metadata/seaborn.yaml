quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating label heights to prevent overlap with dense events
  - 'Clear visual hierarchy: blue data line, yellow event markers create strong contrast'
  - Comprehensive data generation with realistic trend, seasonality, and noise
  - Proper handling of event markers on the actual data line with scatter points
  - Well-sized text elements for readability at high resolution
  weaknesses:
  - No legend or key explaining the event marker style (spec mentions including a
    subtle legend or key)
  - Realistic context score could be higher with more domain-specific context (e.g.,
    actual product category mentioned in labels)
