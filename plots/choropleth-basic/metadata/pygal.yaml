review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal_maps_world extension for creating a world choropleth map
  - Sequential blue color palette is visually appealing and colorblind-accessible
  - Good binning approach that creates clear visual distinctions between income levels
  - Comprehensive geographic coverage spanning all major continents
  - Custom Style properly scales fonts for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Legend placement at bottom with 4 columns efficiently organizes the GDP ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Missing data countries shown as white rather than gray as suggested in spec
  - Could leverage pygal's built-in tooltip/hover interactivity more prominently
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world choropleth map showing GDP per capita
    data across various countries. Countries are shaded in a sequential blue color
    scheme ranging from very light blue (GDP < $10k) through progressively darker
    blues to dark navy (GDP > $50k). The title "choropleth-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. High-income countries like Canada, Norway, Australia, and
    Japan are shown in dark blue, while developing economies in Africa and parts of
    Asia appear in lighter shades. A legend at the bottom displays four bins: GDP
    < $10k, GDP $10k-$25k, GDP $25k-$50k, and GDP > $50k. Countries without data remain
    white/unfilled with visible gray borders.'
