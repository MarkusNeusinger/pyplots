  image_description: 'The plot displays an ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution
    Function) as a step function on a white background. The line is rendered in a
    light blue/steel blue color (#306998). The x-axis is labeled "Value" and ranges
    from approximately -2.4 to 2.0, showing the sorted data values from a normal distribution.
    The y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" and correctly ranges from 0 to 1.
    The title follows the correct format: "ecdf-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai". Horizontal
    and vertical grid lines are present and subtle. The step function clearly shows
    the characteristic S-curve shape of a normal distribution''s CDF, starting near
    0 at the left, passing through 0.5 around x=0, and approaching 1 on the right.'
