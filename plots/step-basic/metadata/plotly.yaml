  image_description: 'The plot displays a step chart showing "Monthly Cumulative Sales"
    over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The chart uses a dark blue line (Python Blue #306998)
    with a stair-step pattern created using ''hv'' (horizontal-then-vertical) style.
    Each data point is marked with a yellow circle (Python Yellow #FFD43B) with a
    blue border. The y-axis shows "Cumulative Sales ($)" ranging from ~50k to ~375k,
    and the x-axis shows months. The title follows the correct format: "Monthly Cumulative
    Sales · step-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai". The legend is positioned in the upper
    left corner with a semi-transparent background. Grid lines are subtle (light gray),
    and the overall layout is clean with a white background (plotly_white template).'
  verdict: APPROVED
