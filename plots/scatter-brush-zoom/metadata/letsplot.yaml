review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent tooltip configuration with layer_tooltips showing point details
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  - Good use of clustered data appropriate for brush selection scenarios
  - HTML export enables interactive zoom and pan functionality
  - Annotation helpfully explains interactive features in the static image
  weaknesses:
  - The spec requires brush selection with visible rectangle and highlighted selected
    points - lets-plot built-in toolbar provides box-zoom but not true brush selection
    with point highlighting
  - Grid completely removed makes it difficult to read precise coordinate values
  - Title position slightly overlaps with y-axis maximum value (100)
  - The implementation relies on HTML export for interactivity but the core spec features
    (brush selection highlighting, selection count display) are not implemented
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with 400 data points distributed
    across 4 distinct clusters. Blue points (Cluster A) are concentrated in the lower-left
    quadrant around (20, 60). Yellow points (Cluster B) form the largest cluster centered
    around (50, 30) in the lower-middle area. Red points (Cluster C) are positioned
    in the upper-right quadrant around (70, 70). Green points (Cluster D) occupy the
    upper-center area around (40, 80). The title "scatter-brush-zoom · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left. A helpful annotation in gray text near the
    top indicates "Interactive HTML: Use toolbar for pan, zoom, box-select, and reset".
    The legend on the right side clearly identifies all four clusters. Axes are labeled
    "X Value (units)" and "Y Value (units)". The plot uses a clean white background
    with no grid lines.'

        comment: While tooltips are well configured, the static PNG cannot demonstrate
          brush selection which is the core spec requirement. Box-zoom in HTML toolbar
          is not true brush selection.
