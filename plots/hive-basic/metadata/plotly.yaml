review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world data scenario (software module dependencies) that clearly
    demonstrates hive plot purpose
  - Clean bezier curve implementation for edges with appropriate transparency (0.35)
    avoiding visual clutter
  - Good color scheme with blue/yellow/teal that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper degree-based node positioning along axes showing centrality
  - Well-sized nodes with white borders for clear visibility
  - Interactive HTML output with hover templates showing node degree
  weaknesses:
  - The UTILITY axis label overlaps with the formatter node label at the axis endpoint,
    making both harder to read
  - Node labels at axis endpoints (formatter, grpc, scheduler) are positioned where
    they collide with axis labels
  - Could improve axis label positioning to avoid node label collisions by extending
    them further from the axis endpoint
