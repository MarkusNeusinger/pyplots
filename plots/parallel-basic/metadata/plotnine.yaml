review:
  strengths:
  - Clean grammar-of-graphics implementation using geom_line and geom_point for parallel
    coordinates
  - Proper data normalization to 0-1 scale for fair comparison across dimensions
  - Excellent colorblind-accessible palette with Python Blue, Yellow, and Red
  - Well-sized text elements with appropriate font sizes for readability
  - Uses Iris dataset - a classic and realistic multi-dimensional example
  weaknesses:
  - Uneven species distribution (20/20/10) could be balanced as 50 samples equally
    distributed
  - Legend title could use a more specific label than generic Species
