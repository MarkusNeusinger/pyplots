review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world application (credit risk scoring) that clearly demonstrates
    logistic regression
  - Complete implementation of all spec requirements including CI band, decision threshold,
    and model metrics annotation
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output
  - Well-balanced layout with informative legend
  weaknesses:
  - Color choice (red/yellow) could be more colorblind-friendly; consider using blue/orange
    palette
  - Axis labels missing units (though Credit Score and Probability are inherently
    unitless, could add ranges)
  - Does not leverage distinctive matplotlib features beyond basics
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression visualization for credit
    score-based loan approval. The horizontal axis shows "Credit Score" ranging from
    300 to 850. The vertical axis shows "Probability of Approval" from 0 to 1. The
    characteristic S-shaped (sigmoid) logistic curve is rendered as a thick blue line
    (#306998), with a light blue semi-transparent 95% confidence interval band surrounding
    it. Data points are jittered along the y-axis: red/coral markers represent rejected
    applications (class 0) clustered near y=0, and yellow/gold markers represent approved
    applications (class 1) clustered near y=1. A gray dashed horizontal line at y=0.5
    indicates the decision threshold. An annotation box in the upper-left displays
    model metrics: Accuracy 78.0%, Coefficient 0.0190, and Intercept -11.78. The legend
    in the lower-right clearly identifies all elements. The title follows the required
    format: "logistic-regression · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
