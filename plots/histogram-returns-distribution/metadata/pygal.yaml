review:
  strengths:
  - Histogram bars render correctly with proper density normalization
  - Tail highlighting beyond ±2σ works well with distinct coloring
  - Statistics (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis) calculated and displayed correctly
  - Good use of XY chart type to create step-polygon histogram effect
  - Code is well-structured and reproducible with seed(42)
  weaknesses:
  - Normal distribution curve overlay is not visible in the rendered output despite
    being added to the chart
  - Y-axis label is misleading (Frequency Density x 100 instead of Probability Density)
  - Title format does not follow the standard spec-id library pyplots.ai pattern
  - Legend entries do not match the full series descriptions and normal curve legend
    is missing
  - X-axis tick labels are rotated and somewhat difficult to read
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns distribution
    with approximately 25 bins. The main histogram bars are rendered in steel blue
    (#306998) for returns within 2 standard deviations, while tail regions (beyond
    ±2σ) are shown in coral/salmon red. The title at the top reads "Daily Returns
    Distribution (Mean: 0.044% | Std: 1.451% | Skew: 0.30 | Kurt: 0.62) · histogram-returns-distribution
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". The x-axis is labeled "Returns (%)" with rotated tick labels
    showing values from approximately -3.7% to 4.3%. The y-axis is labeled "Frequency
    (Density × 100)" with values from 0 to 36. A legend appears at the bottom left
    showing "Returns" and "Tails (>2σ)". Critical issue: The normal distribution curve
    overlay specified in the requirements is NOT visible in the rendered plot - only
    the histogram bars appear.'
