review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of 6 different projection types side-by-side for easy
    comparison
  - Clean, professional color scheme with good contrast (blue land, light ocean, gold
    graticules)
  - Proper use of Plotly geo subplot system with individual projection configurations
  - Interactive HTML output provided alongside PNG
  - Graticule lines at 30-degree intervals as specified
  - Country borders and lakes visible
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from adding Tissot indicatrices to show distortion patterns (mentioned
    as optional in spec)
  - Minor code redundancy with geo configuration being set twice (update_geos and
    update_layout loop)
  image_description: The plot displays a 2×3 grid of world maps, each showcasing a
    different cartographic projection. The main title "map-projections · plotly ·
    pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray. Each subplot has its projection
    name as a title (Mercator, Robinson, Mollweide, Orthographic, Equal Earth, Natural
    Earth). Land masses are rendered in a blue color (#306998), oceans in a light
    blue (#E8F4F8), and coastlines/country borders in dark blue (#1A3D5C). Yellow/gold
    graticule lines (latitude/longitude grid) are visible at 30-degree intervals across
    all projections. The Mercator projection shows the classic rectangular distortion,
    Robinson and Mollweide show elliptical shapes, Orthographic displays a globe-like
    hemisphere view centered on Africa, and Equal Earth and Natural Earth show similar
    pseudo-cylindrical projections. The layout is clean with minimal margins.
