review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lower-triangle format to reduce redundancy as suggested in spec
  - Colorblind-safe blue-orange diverging palette centered at zero
  - Clear cell annotations with 2 decimal places and good text outline for readability
  - Realistic financial metrics data with meaningful correlation patterns
  - Proper use of Highcharts-specific features (colorAxis stops, JavaScript formatters,
    HeatmapSeries)
  - Square aspect ratio (3600x3600) is appropriate for symmetric matrix visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Color bar could benefit from a title label (e.g., Correlation)
  - Variable names on axes lack context (could optionally include units or fuller
    descriptions)
