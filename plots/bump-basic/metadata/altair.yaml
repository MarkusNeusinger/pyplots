review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of Premier League standings as realistic bump chart scenario
  - Proper Y-axis inversion (rank 1 at top) as specified
  - Good use of layered charts combining lines and points for clarity
  - Python Blue (#306998) used as primary color per pyplots convention
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips exported alongside PNG
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (O, Q, N)
  weaknesses:
  - Brown and light gray colors for Man United and Tottenham could be more distinguishable
    for accessibility
  - Missing explicit reproducibility comment (data is deterministic but not annotated)
