review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (quartile lines, mirrored density,
    median)
  - Clean, idiomatic lets_plot code with proper export configuration
  - Realistic salary-by-department data with meaningful variation across categories
  - Dollar formatting on Y-axis and dark violin outlines add professional polish
  - Good use of lets_plot-specific quantile_lines feature
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses two blue hues (Engineering and Sales) that reduce distinguishability
  - No visual storytelling or hierarchy - all violins treated equally without emphasis
  - Quantile lines could be more visually prominent with differentiated median
  - Distribution shapes are all roughly normal - missing opportunity to show bimodal
    or skewed data
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes representing salary distributions
    across four departments: Engineering (dark steel blue, #306998), Marketing (gold/amber,
    #E8A317), Sales (light blue, #4B8BBE), and Design (green, #2E8B57). Each violin
    is mirrored with KDE on both sides and contains three horizontal quantile lines
    (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles). The title reads "violin-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Salary" with dollar-formatted ticks from $0
    to $170,000 in $10k increments. The X-axis is labeled "Department" with the four
    category names. The background uses a minimal theme with only horizontal grid
    lines (no vertical grid, no axis ticks). The violins use trim=False so KDE tails
    extend beyond the data range. Engineering shows the highest center (~$95k) with
    moderate spread, Marketing centers around ~$75k with narrower spread, Sales around
    ~$70k with the widest spread, and Design around ~$80k with moderate spread. No
    legend is displayed since colors map directly to x-axis categories.'
