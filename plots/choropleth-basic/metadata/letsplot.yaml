review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot geocode_countries() for automatic boundary retrieval
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate coordinate limits focusing on Europe
  - Good colorblind-accessible yellow-blue color scheme
  - Proper missing data handling with na_value parameter
  - Well-structured theme with appropriate removal of axes/grid for map visualization
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactive capability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be larger and more prominent for better readability at full size
  - Some European countries missing from data (UK, Iceland, Southern Europe) - more
    coverage recommended
  - Extreme outlier (Luxembourg 126.4k) compresses color scale making mid-range countries
    harder to distinguish
  image_description: The plot displays a choropleth map of Europe showing GDP per
    capita by country. Countries are shaded using a yellow-to-blue color gradient
    (low=#FFD43B to high=#306998). Most Eastern European countries appear in yellow/golden
    tones (lower GDP), while Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) and Western
    European nations (Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland) show brownish-gray
    tones (higher GDP). Luxembourg appears as a tiny blue spot (highest GDP at ~126k
    USD). The map includes clear country boundaries with dark gray outlines. A vertical
    color legend in the lower-right displays "GDP per Capita (thousands USD)" with
    scale from 20 to 120. The title at the top reads "European GDP per Capita · choropleth-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The map uses a clean white background with no grid lines
    or axis labels, which is appropriate for geographic visualization.
