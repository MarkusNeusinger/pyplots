review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent mathematical surface with multiple features (peaks, valley, gradients)
    that clearly demonstrates filled contour capabilities
  - Proper use of viridis colormap which is colorblind-safe and perceptually uniform
  - Overlaid white contour lines with appropriate alpha for level identification as
    recommended in spec
  - Clean KISS code structure following matplotlib best practices
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizes throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "X Position (units)" or use a more realistic
    application context)
  - Mathematical demonstration is generic rather than a compelling real-world scenario
    (e.g., topographic elevation, temperature field)
  - Could add contour labels (clabel) to show numerical values on contour lines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization of a 2D mathematical
    surface. The plot uses the viridis colormap, ranging from dark purple (approximately
    -0.6) through teal/blue, green, to bright yellow (approximately 1.5). The surface
    shows multiple features: two prominent yellow peaks (one around coordinates (1,
    1) and another around (-1.5, -1)), a dark purple valley/depression around (-0.5,
    1.5), and a smaller peak around (1.5, -1.5). White contour lines are overlaid
    on the filled regions for level identification. The X and Y axes range from -3
    to 3, labeled as "X Position" and "Y Position" respectively. A colorbar on the
    right shows "Surface Height (z)" values. The title correctly displays "contour-filled
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The plot uses equal aspect ratio, making the overall
    shape square within a 16:9 canvas.'
