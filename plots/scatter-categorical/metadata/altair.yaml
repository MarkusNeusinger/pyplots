review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect use of redundant encoding (color + shape) for maximum accessibility
  - Well-chosen Iris-inspired data with three clearly separable clusters
  - Excellent font sizing across all text elements (title, axes, legend)
  - Good use of Altair declarative features including tooltips for interactivity
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - None - implementation meets all quality criteria
  image_description: The plot displays a categorical scatter plot showing Iris-like
    petal measurements for three plant species. Setosa (blue circles) clusters tightly
    in the bottom-left corner with petal lengths ~0.9-2.0 cm and widths ~0-0.4 cm.
    Versicolor (yellow squares) occupies the middle region with petal lengths ~3.0-5.5
    cm and widths ~0.9-2.0 cm. Virginica (olive-green triangles) extends to the upper-right
    with petal lengths ~4.5-8.0 cm and widths ~1.0-2.7 cm. The three species form
    well-separated clusters showing clear categorical distinction. Title reads "scatter-categorical
    · altair · pyplots.ai" and axis labels include units (cm). Legend is positioned
    in the upper-right corner with appropriately sized symbols.
  verdict: APPROVED
