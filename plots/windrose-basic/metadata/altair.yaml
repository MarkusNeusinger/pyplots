review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual polar coordinate implementation using arc polygons - clever approach
    for a library without native polar support
  - Realistic wind data using Weibull distribution mimics actual wind patterns
  - Beautiful color progression from cool to warm for speed ranges
  - 'Clean layered composition: grid → data → labels'
  - Interactive tooltips showing direction, speed range, and frequency
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit "Frequency (%)" label for the radial axis
  - Scale factor should be 3.0 per library guidelines, not 4.0
  - The 25% label overlaps slightly with the NE direction label
