review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hierarchical clustering with Ward's method and Euclidean
    distance as specified
  - Both row and column dendrograms properly displayed and aligned with the heatmap
  - Diverging blue-white-red colormap perfectly centered around zero for expression
    data
  - Realistic gene expression context with meaningful cluster structure (drug-specific
    responses)
  - Clean integration of dendrograms via SVG overlay technique
  - Good use of square 1:1 aspect ratio appropriate for clustered heatmaps
  - Properly saves both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  weaknesses:
  - The helper function get_dendro_paths() breaks the KISS principle (imports → data
    → plot → save)
  - Row dendrogram lines could be slightly thicker for better visibility at the rendered
    size
  - Minor excess whitespace at bottom of the chart
