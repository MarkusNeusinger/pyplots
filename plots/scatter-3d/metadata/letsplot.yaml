review:
  strengths:
  - Creative 3D projection approach using isometric transformation with depth-based
    sizing for perspective effect
  - Viridis colormap for altitude encoding provides good colorblind accessibility
  - Three distinct clusters demonstrate spatial relationships effectively
  - Axis reference lines help orient viewer in pseudo-3D space
  - Clean code structure with proper KISS style and reproducibility (seed=42)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis reference lines (gray segments) are too short and positioned awkwardly -
    they appear disconnected from the data and do not clearly indicate X, Y, Z directions
    with labels
  - The three projected axis lines should be labeled with X, Y, Z text to help viewers
    understand the 3D orientation
  - Grid has been completely removed (panel_grid=element_blank) but some subtle grid
    or floor plane would help perceive 3D depth better
