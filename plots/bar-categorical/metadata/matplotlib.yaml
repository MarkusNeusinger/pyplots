review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean KISS code structure following the imports → data → plot → save pattern
  - Realistic survey data scenario with varied frequency distribution
  - Proper descending sort as suggested in the specification
  - Value labels on bars enhance readability and data communication
  - Professional appearance with removed top/right spines and subtle grid
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features (e.g., custom hatching, gradient
    fills, or annotation arrows)
  - Y-axis label "Count (Frequency)" is slightly redundant - could be simplified
