review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color accessibility using seaborn colorblind palette (blue/orange contrast)
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-chosen real-world scenario (hourly temperature by season) that demonstrates
    cyclical data visualization
  - Clean code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good use of closed loops to create continuous circular lines
  - Clear axis labeling with units and 24-hour time format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend styling (fancybox=True, shadow=True) is overly decorative and inconsistent
    with clean seaborn aesthetic
