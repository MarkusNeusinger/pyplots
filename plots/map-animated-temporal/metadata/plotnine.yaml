review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent temporal storytelling showing aftershock spread over 6 days
  - Good use of facet_wrap for small multiples (appropriate for libraries without
    animation)
  - Realistic earthquake aftershock scenario with proper magnitude decay over time
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  weaknesses:
  - Missing basemap/geographic context (spec requires basemap with boundaries or coastlines)
  - Duplicate legends for Magnitude (both color and size legends shown separately)
  - Color palette (yellow-red) is not optimal for colorblind accessibility
  - Axis labels lack degree units (should be Longitude and Latitude with degree symbols)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x3 small multiples grid showing earthquake
    aftershock data over 6 days (March 01-06, 2024) in the California region. Each
    facet represents one day, with scatter points showing aftershock locations. Points
    are colored using a yellow-to-red gradient (where yellow represents lower magnitude
    ~6 and red represents higher magnitude ~10) and sized by magnitude. The axes show
    Longitude (approximately -124 to -112) on the x-axis and Latitude (approximately
    32 to 41) on the y-axis. A light blue panel background provides good contrast.
    Two legends appear on the right: a continuous color gradient legend for Magnitude
    and a discrete size legend for Magnitude. The title follows the correct format.
    The temporal evolution shows the aftershocks spreading geographically from a central
    epicenter over time, with early days showing concentrated high-magnitude events
    and later days showing more dispersed lower-magnitude events.'
