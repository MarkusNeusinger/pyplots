review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world data scenario with programming languages positioned by paradigm
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of alpha transparency for overlapping text
  - Well-designed color palette with 9 distinct categories
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Text overlap in the dense middle region (JavaScript/TypeScript, R/Julia/MATLAB
    cluster) reduces readability
  - Legend displays small a characters instead of example text labels
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive features like interactive tooltips or
    hover info
  - Some text labels in crowded areas could benefit from rotation or position adjustment
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter-text visualization showing 30 programming
    languages positioned on a 2D space. The X-axis represents the paradigm spectrum
    from Object-Oriented (left) to Functional (right), ranging from -0.05 to 0.95.
    The Y-axis represents the Abstraction Level from Low (bottom) to High (top), ranging
    from 0.1 to 0.9. Each programming language name is rendered as colored text at
    its coordinate position, with colors encoding the "Primary Use" category. The
    legend on the right shows 9 categories: General (blue), Web (yellow), Systems
    (teal), Mobile (purple), Functional (orange), Scripting (red), Data Science (blue-green),
    Scientific (olive), and Legacy (gray). The title reads "scatter-text · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. Languages like Assembly and COBOL appear in
    the bottom-left (low abstraction, OO), while Haskell and Clojure appear in the
    top-right (high abstraction, functional). The background uses a minimal theme
    with subtle grid lines.'
