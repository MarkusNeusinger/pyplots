review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent specification compliance with density histogram and theoretical PDF
    overlay
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Great color contrast between histogram bars and PDF curve
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Realistic test score data scenario with appropriate sample size (n=500)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features like fill_between for PDF shading
    or axvline for mean
  - Legend positioned in upper left slightly overlaps with potential data area
