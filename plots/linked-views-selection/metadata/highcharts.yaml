review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of linked views with brush selection and synchronized
    highlighting
  - Uses Highcharts selection events and series update patterns effectively
  - Clean, professional dashboard layout with three coordinated charts
  - Colorblind-safe palette consistently applied across all views
  - Proper HTML export for interactive viewing alongside static PNG
  - Good use of Iris dataset - realistic and appropriate for demonstration
  - Reset button and selection info text enhance interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter plot markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Legend positioned at very bottom of scatter chart is somewhat small
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a dashboard-style layout with three coordinated Highcharts visualizations for the Iris dataset:

    1. **Left panel (large)**: A scatter plot titled "Sepal Dimensions by Species" showing sepal length (x-axis) vs sepal width (y-axis) with three color-coded species: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica (purple #9467BD). All 150 Iris samples are displayed as circular markers.

    2. **Top-right panel**: A bar chart titled "Species Distribution" showing the count of each species (50 each) with matching category colors.

    3. **Bottom-right panel**: A histogram titled "Petal Length Distribution" showing frequency distribution across 10 bins with counts labeled on each bar.

    The main title "linked-views-selection · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center with a subtitle. The layout uses a 2:1 grid with the scatter plot spanning both rows on the left. All charts have clean white/light gray backgrounds with subtle grid lines. A legend at the bottom of the scatter plot identifies the three species. The color palette is colorblind-safe (blue, yellow, purple).
