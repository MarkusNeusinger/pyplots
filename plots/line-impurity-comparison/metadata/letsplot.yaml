review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features including annotations, legend
    with formulas, and edge case handling
  - 'Strong visual storytelling: the shaded ribbon, open circle markers at maxima,
    and Maximum uncertainty annotation create a clear educational narrative'
  - 'Good use of lets-plot distinctive features: layer_tooltips with custom formatting
    and HTML export'
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles with deterministic data
  - Thoughtful color choice (blue/orange) that is colorblind-safe and visually harmonious
  weaknesses:
  - 'Left boundary annotation p->0: both->0 is partially clipped at the plot edge
    - increase left margin or shift the annotation slightly right'
  - Some empty space in the lower portion of the plot could be better utilized
  - Slightly verbose code with separate geom_point calls for each marker instead of
    a unified approach
  - The markers_df has a color column that is never mapped to an aesthetic
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth curves on a clean minimal white/light-gray
    background comparing Gini impurity and entropy as decision tree splitting criteria.
    The blue curve (Gini: 2p(1-p)) peaks at 0.5 at p=0.5, while the orange curve (Entropy
    (normalized)) peaks at 1.0 at p=0.5. A light blue shaded ribbon fills the area
    between the two curves, visually highlighting their difference. Open circle markers
    with white fill sit at both maxima at p=0.5. A bold italic annotation reads "Maximum
    uncertainty at p = 0.5" with a small downward arrow. An italic annotation on the
    right side explains the "Shaded region: difference between metrics." Boundary
    annotations at the left and right edges note "p -> 0: both -> 0" and "p -> 1:
    both -> 0." A dashed vertical guideline marks p=0.5. The title reads "line-impurity-comparison
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with an informative subtitle. The legend at the bottom
    shows both series. X-axis is labeled "Probability of class 1 (p)" (0-1 in 0.1
    increments), Y-axis is "Impurity measure (normalized)" (0-1 in 0.2 increments).'
