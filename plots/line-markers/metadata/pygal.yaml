review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-scaled font sizes for the large canvas
  - Clear colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, red)
  - Proper use of pygal marker functionality with show_dots=True and dots_size=16
  - Realistic temperature sensor scenario with appropriate seasonal variation
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent, professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper left creates slight visual imbalance; positioning at
    bottom would be better
  - Grid lines only on Y-axis; could add subtle X-guides for complete reference
  - Marker visibility good but does not use different marker shapes for series as
    suggested in spec notes (pygal limitation)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart with markers showing temperature
    readings (°C) over 12 months (Jan-Dec). Three series are shown: Sensor A (blue),
    Sensor B (yellow/gold), and Sensor C (red/coral). Each line has clearly visible
    circular markers at each data point. The title "line-markers · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The legend is positioned in the upper left with colored
    squares identifying each sensor. The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from
    approximately 13-27, and the X-axis shows "Month" with abbreviated month names.
    Horizontal grid lines are visible. The lines show seasonal patterns with sinusoidal
    variation and some noise.'

        comment: Markers are clearly visible (dots_size=16) and lines are appropriately
          thick (stroke_width=6). Markers stand out well against lines.

        comment: Y-axis grid lines are visible and subtle. Legend is functional but
          could be better positioned (at bottom or right side would reduce visual
          imbalance).

        comment: Uses pygal's SVG-native capabilities, custom Style, show_dots and
          dots_size for markers. However, doesn't leverage pygal's unique tooltip/interactivity
          features in the HTML output or use fill_opacity for the area variation.
  verdict: APPROVED
