review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe palette (Dark2 inspired) with good contrast
  - Proper use of facet_grid for scatter matrix layout
  - Clear species separation visible in scatter plots
  - Appropriate subtitle noting plotnine static nature limitations
  - Good data choice using classic Iris dataset
  weaknesses:
  - Diagonal histograms not rendering - cells appear empty (critical for spec compliance)
  - Axis labels lack units (should be cm as noted in var_labels but not displayed
    on axes)
  - Subtitle format deviates from standard title format requirement
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) of the Iris
    dataset showing pairwise relationships between Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal
    Length, and Petal Width. Three species are color-coded: setosa (blue), versicolor
    (yellow/gold), and virginica (coral/red). The title correctly shows "scatter-matrix-interactive
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle noting interactive brushing requires
    Plotly/Bokeh/Altair. The diagonal cells appear empty (histograms are not visible),
    while off-diagonal cells show scatter plots with good separation between species
    clusters. The legend is positioned at the bottom with a white background. Strip
    labels appear on top (column names) and right (row names) sides of the matrix.
    The overall layout is 16x16 inches with a clean white background and subtle gray
    grid lines.'
