review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear differentiation between 3×3 box boundaries
    and cell boundaries
  - Clean, monochrome design suitable for printing as specified
  - Numbers are bold, large, and perfectly centered in cells
  - Properly handles empty cells by not displaying zeros
  - Uses correct pyplots.ai title format
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor code redundancy: axhline call is redundant since plot() draws the same
    horizontal lines'
  - Spec mentions black-and-white design but implementation uses Python Blue - though
    this is arguably an aesthetic improvement
  improvements:
  - Remove the redundant axhline call as it draws duplicate lines that are immediately
    covered by the plot() calls
  - Consider adding a thin outer border around the entire grid for a more polished
    appearance
  - Could add subtle background shading to alternate 3×3 boxes to further enhance
    visual distinction
