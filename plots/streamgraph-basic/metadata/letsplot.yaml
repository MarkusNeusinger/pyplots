review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of centered baseline algorithm for authentic streamgraph
    appearance
  - Clean, readable code with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Well-chosen color palette with good visual contrast between adjacent areas
  - Appropriate removal of y-axis ticks/grid since streamgraphs emphasize relative
    proportions
  - Correct title format and professional layout with good canvas utilization
  - Realistic music streaming scenario matching the specification exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Curves are linear/segmented rather than smooth spline interpolation as specified
  - X-axis grid lines could be more subtle (currently dashed at 0.5 alpha)
  - Y-axis label shows Streaming Hours without units like hrs/month
  image_description: 'The plot displays a streamgraph showing music genre streaming
    hours over a two-year period (Jan ''23 to Dec ''24). Five genres are shown: Pop
    (dark blue at bottom), Rock (yellow), Hip-Hop (cyan/light blue), Electronic (purple),
    and Jazz (orange at top). The chart uses a symmetric centered baseline creating
    a river-like flowing appearance. The x-axis shows months with labels at Jan ''23,
    Jul ''23, Jan ''24, Jul ''24, and Dec ''24. The y-axis is labeled "Streaming Hours"
    but has no tick marks or values (appropriately hidden for streamgraphs). A legend
    on the right identifies all genres. The title follows the required format: "streamgraph-basic
    · lets-plot · pyplots.ai". The colors are distinct and harmonious, with smooth
    flowing curves showing seasonal variations and trends.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (aes, geom_ribbon, scale_fill_manual, theme_minimal),
          but geom_ribbon is basic rather than using lets-plot specific advanced features
