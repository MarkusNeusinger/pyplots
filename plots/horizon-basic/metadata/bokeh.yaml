review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the horizon chart concept with proper band folding
    and color intensity encoding
  - Clean visual layout with 6 series stacked vertically using appropriate spacing
  - Realistic server monitoring data scenario with varied patterns including periodic
    behavior and spikes
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and varea for efficient rendering
  - Proper title format and overall professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend or annotation explaining what the color bands represent (positive/negative
    values, intensity levels)
  - Series name labels on the left side could be larger for better readability at
    full resolution
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific interactive features like customized HoverTool
    showing actual values
  - Blue/red color scheme may be challenging for some colorblind users; consider blue/orange
    alternative
