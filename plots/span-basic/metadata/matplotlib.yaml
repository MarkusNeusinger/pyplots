review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical (axvspan for recession period) and horizontal
    (axhspan for risk zone) spans in a single plot
  - Highly realistic and recognizable scenario using 2008 financial crisis as context
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Perfect use of matplotlib native span functions (axvspan, axhspan) with appropriate
    alpha transparency
  - Text sizing follows library guidelines exactly (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt
    ticks)
  - Good color contrast between blue line, yellow vertical span, and red horizontal
    span
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper left slightly overlaps with the beginning of the stock
    price line data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series of stock prices from 2006 to
    2016. The main data is shown as a blue line (Python blue #306998) representing
    "Stock Price". There are two highlighted span regions: (1) a yellow vertical span
    from 2008-2009 labeled "Recession Period" which clearly marks the financial crisis
    era where the stock price drops significantly, and (2) a red/pink horizontal span
    from $60-$80 labeled "Risk Zone" spanning the full width of the plot. The title
    reads "span-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axis labels show "Year"
    on x-axis and "Price ($)" on y-axis. A legend in the upper left clearly identifies
    all three elements. The grid is subtle with dashed lines. The price starts around
    $195, peaks above $200 in 2007, drops during the recession period to around $150,
    and stabilizes around $145-150 for the remaining years.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib's axvspan() and axhspan() which are the idiomatic
          way to create span regions, proper use of Axes methods as specified in library
          rules
  verdict: APPROVED
