review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered chart composition to build error bars from primitives
    (rule + tick marks)
  - Clear asymmetric error demonstration with visually distinct upper/lower bounds
    across products
  - Proper tooltip implementation showing all relevant values (central, lower, upper
    bounds)
  - Perfect title format and descriptive axis labels with context
  - Good color scheme using Python official colors with high contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Data scenario could be more specific (e.g., Manufacturing Batch Quality) rather
    than generic Product A-F
  - Could leverage Altair selection/highlight features for enhanced interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays 6 products (Product A through F) on the x-axis
    with quality scores on the y-axis (range 50-104). Each data point is shown as
    a filled yellow circle with a blue border. Blue vertical error bars extend asymmetrically
    above and below each central point, with horizontal caps (tick marks) at both
    ends clearly marking the error bounds. The title "errorbar-asymmetric · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The y-axis label reads "Quality Score (10th–90th
    Percentile)". An italicized annotation in the lower-right corner states "Error
    bars show 10th–90th percentile range". The grid is subtle (low opacity), and the
    overall color scheme uses Python blue (#306998) for bars and Python yellow (#FFD43B)
    for points.

        comment: Good use of layered composition (mark_rule + mark_tick + mark_point),
          tooltips for interactivity, but could have used selection for highlighting
  verdict: APPROVED
