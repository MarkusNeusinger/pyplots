review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex 3×3 faceted grid using Highcharts multi-axis
    capability
  - Colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between soil types (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Realistic plant growth study with meaningful data patterns showing light and soil
    effects
  - Proper use of annotations module for column and row facet labels
  - Correct title format and subtitle explaining the faceting structure
  - Shared axis scales across all facets enabling direct comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label shows 'Values' instead of 'Growth (cm)' in middle and right columns
    (inconsistent labeling)
  - Text sizes could be larger for optimal readability at 4800×2700 resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3×3 faceted grid of scatter plots showing
    "Plant Growth Study". The columns represent light conditions (Low, Medium, High)
    with bold labels at the top. The rows represent soil types (Sandy, Loamy, Clay)
    labeled on the right side. Each subplot shows scatter points with Water (mm) on
    X-axis (range 15-105) and Growth (cm) on Y-axis (range 0-55). Colors are colorblind-safe:
    Blue (#306998) for Sandy row, Yellow (#FFD43B) for Loamy row, and Purple (#9467BD)
    for Clay row. Points show clear positive correlation between water and growth,
    with higher growth values in High light conditions. The main title uses the correct
    format "facet-grid · highcharts · pyplots.ai". A subtitle explains the faceting
    structure.'
