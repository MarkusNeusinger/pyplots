review:
  strengths:
  - Title format now correctly follows the specification (horizon-basic · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai)
  - Added subtle dashed vertical grid lines improving time-series readability across
    all series
  - Excellent implementation of custom chart type extending pygal Graph class for
    SVG rendering
  - Colorblind-safe blue-orange diverging color scheme with clear 3-band gradients
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with 6 metrics over 24 hours at 15-minute
    intervals
  - Clean row separation with borders and background colors for visual distinction
  weaknesses:
  - Class-based structure is necessary for this custom chart type but technically
    violates KISS (unavoidable trade-off)
  - X-axis label Time could include units (e.g., Time HH:MM) for full compliance
