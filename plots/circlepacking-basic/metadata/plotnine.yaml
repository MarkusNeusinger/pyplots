review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_polygon to render circles as polygons, creative approach
    within plotnine limitations
  - Clean color scheme with gray/blue/yellow that clearly distinguishes hierarchy
    levels
  - Well-implemented custom circle packing algorithm with tangent positioning
  - Proper legend placement and formatting at bottom
  - Good realistic data scenario with company organizational structure
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses functions (make_circle_points, find_tangent_positions, pack_circles)
    violating KISS structure requirement
  - Root circle has significant empty space - circles could be packed more efficiently
  - Circle sizes do not accurately reflect value proportions (Backend=20 should be
    much larger than DevOps=12)
  - Department labels positioned at top of circles can be hard to associate with their
    circle
  - Square aspect ratio (12x12) rather than recommended 16:9 or explicit square 3600x3600
    format
