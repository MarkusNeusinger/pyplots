review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and colorblind-safe color scheme
  - Perfect implementation of the pyramid chart concept with negative values for left-extending
    bars
  - Smart use of labelExpr to display absolute values on the x-axis while using signed
    values internally
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code with proper encoding types (N for nominal, Q for
    quantitative)
  - Informative tooltips showing gender, age group, and absolute population values
  - Proper age group ordering (youngest at bottom, traditional pyramid orientation)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-right corner could be placed closer to the chart or integrated
    differently
  - Could leverage Altair interactive selection features for highlighting individual
    bars or genders
  - Data shows limited demographic variation - more pronounced asymmetry in older
    age groups would better demonstrate the visualization purpose
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid chart with 9 age groups
    (0-9 through 80+) on the Y-axis, arranged with youngest at the bottom. Blue horizontal
    bars extend leftward from the center representing male population, while yellow/gold
    bars extend rightward representing female population. The X-axis shows "Population
    (millions)" with symmetric scale from 8 to 8 (displayed as absolute values). A
    legend labeled "Gender" in the top-right corner identifies Male (blue square)
    and Female (yellow square). The title "pyramid-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top. The pyramid shape is clearly visible with the largest bars
    in the 40-49 age group and progressively smaller bars toward both younger and
    older ages. Subtle dashed grid lines aid readability.
