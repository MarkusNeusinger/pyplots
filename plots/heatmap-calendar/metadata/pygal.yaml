review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution extending pygal Graph class to implement calendar heatmap (pygal
    lacks native calendar support)
  - GitHub-style green color palette is instantly recognizable and appropriate
  - Clean month and weekday label positioning with no overlapping text
  - Good use of rounded corners on cells for modern aesthetic
  - Informative legend with numeric value ranges and Less/More labels
  - Realistic contribution data pattern simulating weekday vs weekend activity
  weaknesses:
  - Poor canvas utilization - calendar grid occupies only ~30% of vertical space,
    leaving large empty areas above and below
  - Cells should be larger to better fill the available vertical space on the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Legend value ranges are hardcoded and do not reflect actual data distribution
