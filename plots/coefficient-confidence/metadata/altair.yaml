review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative layer composition (zero_line + error_bars
    + points)
  - Clean conditional coloring using alt.condition for significance distinction
  - Interactive tooltips enhance user experience
  - Perfect horizontal layout for long variable names as spec recommends
  - Well-chosen Python Blue color scheme consistent with pyplots branding
  - Proper categorical ordering to maintain sorted display
  weaknesses:
  - No explicit legend explaining the blue/gray color coding for significant/non-significant
    coefficients
  - 'Minor: saves both .png and .html when only .png is strictly required'
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot with 12 predictor
    variables for housing prices arranged on the Y-axis, sorted from lowest to highest
    coefficient value. Each variable is represented by a point (filled circle) indicating
    the coefficient estimate, with horizontal error bars showing 95% confidence intervals.
    A dashed vertical line at zero serves as the null hypothesis reference. Significant
    coefficients (CIs not crossing zero) are shown in Python Blue (#306998), while
    non-significant coefficients (Property Tax Rate, whose CI crosses zero) are shown
    in gray (#999999). The X-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate (Effect on Price in
    $1000s)" with values ranging from approximately -30 to 58. The title "coefficient-confidence
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Variables include Distance to Downtown
    (negative effect), Property Tax Rate, Year Built, and various positive predictors
    like Living Area, Pool, Number of Bathrooms, etc.
