review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of histogram-KDE visualization using pygal XY chart capabilities
  - Creative approach using step-like XY path to simulate histogram bars since pygal.Histogram
    has different semantics
  - Clean manual KDE implementation using Scott rule for bandwidth estimation
  - Semi-transparent histogram (opacity=0.55) allows KDE curve visibility as spec
    recommends
  - Properly scaled density values (not raw counts) making histogram and KDE comparable
  - Good color contrast between blue histogram and red KDE curve
  - Appropriate font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent and could use subtle alpha adjustment
  - KDE curve stroke width could be slightly more prominent against the filled area
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram with KDE overlay visualizing stock
    return distributions. The histogram is rendered in semi-transparent blue (#306998)
    using a step-like XY path approach, with bars showing frequency counts across
    25 bins spanning from approximately -5% to +6% daily returns. A smooth red/pink
    KDE curve overlays the histogram, following the distribution shape. The title
    "histogram-kde · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The X-axis is labeled
    "Daily Return (%)" and the Y-axis shows "Probability Density" with values from
    0 to ~0.27. A legend at the bottom identifies "Histogram" and "KDE Curve". The
    distribution shows a main peak centered near 0%, with visible left tail (market
    drops) and right tail (market rallies) demonstrating realistic stock return behavior.

        comment: Good use of pygal's XY chart with custom Style, fill options, and
          stroke_style; however, doesn't leverage any particularly unique pygal features
          like tooltips or animations
  verdict: APPROVED
