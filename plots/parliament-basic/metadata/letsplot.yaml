review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular parliament visualization with clean concentric arcs
  - Uses neutral non-political data context (board divisions instead of political
    parties)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct, visually appealing colors
  - Legend clearly shows division names with seat counts in parentheses
  - Includes majority threshold annotation and total seats information
  - Good use of theme_void for clean presentation
  - Proper aspect ratio with coord_fixed
  weaknesses:
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (one word)
  - Seats are distributed by row rather than strictly left-to-right across the semicircle
