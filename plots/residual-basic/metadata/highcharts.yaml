review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including zero reference line
    with label, smoothed trend line, and proper transparency
  - Symmetric y-axis around zero as recommended for residual plots
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between scatter points and trend line
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good data generation showing realistic residual patterns with intentional outliers
    and mild heteroscedasticity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or more specific context (could use parenthetical explanations)
  - Margins are generous but slightly excessive, reducing the effective plot area
  - Trend line label says Trend (Smoothed) but spec suggests LOWESS/LOESS terminology
    would be more precise
  image_description: The plot displays a residual scatter plot with a blue color scheme
    (#306998) for data points. The title "residual-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top with a subtitle "Residuals from Linear Regression Model." The
    X-axis is labeled "Fitted Values" ranging from ~10 to ~98, and the Y-axis is labeled
    "Residuals" with a symmetric range from -40 to +40. A horizontal blue reference
    line at y=0 is present with a "Zero Reference" label on the right. The scatter
    points show moderate transparency with blue outlines. A yellow/gold smoothed trend
    line (labeled "Trend (Smoothed)" in the legend) runs through the data showing
    slight variation. The legend is positioned in the top-right corner. Several outliers
    are visible (around +28, +33, and -25). The layout uses the full canvas well with
    appropriate margins.

        comment: Uses plotLines for zero reference, spline series for trend, proper
          chart configuration. Could leverage more interactive tooltips or data labels
          for outlier highlighting
