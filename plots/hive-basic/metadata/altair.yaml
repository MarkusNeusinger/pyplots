review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic software dependency scenario that perfectly fits the hive
    plot use case
  - Clean color scheme with Python-inspired blue and yellow plus complementary teal
  - Good edge transparency (0.4) prevents hairball effect while showing connections
  - Proper 3-axis hive plot structure with meaningful axis assignment (Core/Utility/Interface)
  - Includes tooltips for interactive exploration when viewing HTML version
  - Node positioning based on importance creates meaningful hierarchy within each
    axis
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has poor canvas utilization - plot is centered in upper portion leaving
    ~40% empty space at bottom
  - Uses helper function polar_to_cartesian violating KISS principle - should inline
    the calculations
  - Legend is redundant since axis labels already show module types with colors
  - Some label overlap on the Interface axis where nodes are closer together
  - Does not leverage Altair data transformation capabilities - manual position calculation
    is not idiomatic Altair
  - Font sizes could be larger for better readability at target resolution
