review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with Python blue/yellow color scheme providing strong
    contrast
  - Box plots and strip points are well-separated visually while maintaining their
    relationship
  - Good jitter implementation prevents point overlap while keeping points associated
    with their categories
  - Data demonstrates multiple distribution characteristics (normal, tight spread,
    outliers, bimodal)
  - Correct title format and clear axis labels
  - Clean, linear code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Performance Score (%)" would be clearer)
  - Could use Plotly native boxpoints parameter instead of manually adding scatter
    traces for a more elegant solution
  - Grid alpha is perhaps too subtle, making it hard to read precise values
