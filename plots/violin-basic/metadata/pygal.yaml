  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with four distinct distribution shapes (normal, gamma-skewed,
    wide normal, bimodal) showcasing violin plot strengths
  - Creative construction of violins using pygal XY chart with filled polygons and
    manual KDE using Silverman rule
  - 'Layered visual approach: violin fill, darker IQR box, white median line creates
    clear internal structure'
  - Intentionally wider Advanced violin draws attention to its unique bimodal distribution
  - Custom cohesive color palette with thoughtful opacity and foreground color hierarchy
  - Perfect spec compliance and data quality with realistic educational context
  - Clean well-structured code with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Library Mastery limited by pygal lack of native violin chart support — core visualization
    is manual polygon construction
  - White median lines are subtle against lighter parts of the violin fill
  - Some wasted canvas space on the right side and below the data range
  - Monospace font rendering from pygal detracts slightly from publication polish
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes on a white background representing
    test score distributions across class groups. Each violin is a different color:
    Honors in steel blue (#306998), Standard in salmon/orange (#E8875B), Remedial
    in sage green (#5BA37E), and Advanced in bold gold (#D4A017). Each violin has
    a mirrored KDE shape, a darker inner rectangle representing the IQR (Q1-Q3), and
    a thin white horizontal median line. The title "violin-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is at the top in monospace font. The Y-axis reads "Test Score (%)" with ticks
    from 30% to 100%, and the X-axis reads "Class Group" with labels Honors, Standard,
    Remedial, Advanced. Subtle horizontal grid lines are visible. The Honors violin
    is compact and centered around 88-90%. Standard is taller and right-skewed, centered
    around 70-72%. Remedial has the widest vertical spread, centered around 62%. Advanced
    is the widest violin (intentionally) and shows a distinctive bimodal shape with
    peaks around 75% and 93%.'

        comment: Custom cohesive palette, layered visual effect (violin fill, darker

          Core visualization is manual polygon construction since pygal lacks native
