review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal_maps_world extension for creating a world choropleth map
  - Sequential blue color palette is visually appealing and colorblind-accessible
  - Good binning approach that creates clear visual distinctions between income levels
  - Comprehensive geographic coverage spanning all major continents
  - Custom Style properly scales fonts for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Legend placement at bottom with 4 columns efficiently organizes the GDP ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Missing data countries shown as white rather than gray as suggested in spec
  - Could leverage pygal's built-in tooltip/hover interactivity more prominently
