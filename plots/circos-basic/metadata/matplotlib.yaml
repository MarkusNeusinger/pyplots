review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper segment proportions and visual gaps
  - Bezier curve ribbons correctly show connection magnitude through width
  - Inner data track adds additional information layer as specified
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct, identifiable colors
  - Professional-quality output suitable for publication
  - Well-structured, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Figure uses 12x12 square format instead of recommended 3600x3600 pixels (12*300=3600,
    so dimensions are correct but explicit figsize comment would help)
  - Legend positioned outside main canvas area requiring bbox_inches=tight - could
    be integrated more elegantly
  - Could use matplotlib built-in Wedge/Arc patches for cleaner segment drawing
