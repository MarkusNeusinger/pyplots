review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart color scheme differentiating hierarchy levels with colorblind-safe palette
  - Good use of file system metaphor making the data immediately understandable
  - Adaptive label truncation prevents overlap while maintaining readability
  - Level labels on right side provide helpful context
  - Clean legend placement at bottom
  weaknesses:
  - Manual SVG construction is necessary but makes code more complex than typical
    pygal implementations
  - Some leaf nodes have very narrow rectangles making labels hard to read (e.g.,
    Cov.., Th..)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical icicle chart with 4 levels
    arranged vertically (top-to-bottom). The root node (blue, #306998) spans the full
    width at the top labeled "Root". Below it, three category nodes in yellow (#FFD43B)
    show "Documents", "Pictures", and "Music" with proportional widths. The third
    level (teal, #4ECDC4) contains subcategories like "Reports", "Letters", "Spreadsheets",
    "Photos", "Screenshots", "Icons", "Albums", "Playlists", and "Podcasts". The bottom
    level (coral, #FF6B6B) shows individual items like "Q1 Report", "Q2 Report", "Photo
    1", "Rock", "Jazz", etc. Level labels appear on the right side (Root, Category,
    Subcategory, Item). A legend at the bottom shows the four hierarchy levels with
    color coding. The title "icicle-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed
    at the top.'

        comment: Uses pygal Style for theming and config; SVG generation is manual
          since pygal lacks native icicle chart support
