review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Manhattan plot with proper chromosome coloring and
    cumulative positioning
  - Good use of Bokeh interactive tools (pan, zoom, save) for exploration of GWAS
    data
  - Clear threshold lines with labels for genome-wide and suggestive significance
    levels
  - Appropriate point sizing differentiation between significant and non-significant
    SNPs
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain color coding (blue/light blue for chromosomes, yellow
    for significant)
  - Could add HoverTool to show SNP details on mouseover, which is a key Bokeh strength
