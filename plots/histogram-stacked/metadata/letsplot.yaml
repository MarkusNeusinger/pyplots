  strengths:
  - Excellent title format following the required pattern exactly
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate text sizes
  - Good use of white borders to separate stacked segments
  - Realistic educational data context with three distinct class distributions
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with geom_histogram and position=stack
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs saved correctly per library requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned with excessive whitespace on the right side
  - Could use more distinctive lets-plot features (e.g., tooltips, flavor themes)
  - Color palette includes red and yellow which may be suboptimal for red-green colorblind
    users
  image_description: 'The plot shows a stacked histogram displaying test scores from
    three different classes (A, B, C). The x-axis shows "Test Score (points)" ranging
    from ~40 to 105, and the y-axis shows "Number of Students" ranging from 0 to 75.
    Three distinct colors are used: blue (Class A), yellow (Class B), and red (Class
    C). The bars are stacked, with Class A at the bottom, Class B in the middle, and
    Class C on top. The distribution is roughly bell-shaped, peaking around the 70-75
    score range. White borders separate the stacked segments within each bin. A legend
    on the right identifies the three classes. The title follows the required format:
    "histogram-stacked · lets-plot · pyplots.ai". The overall layout uses a minimal
    theme with subtle grid lines.'
