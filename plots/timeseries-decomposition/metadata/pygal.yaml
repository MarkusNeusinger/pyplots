review:
  strengths:
  - Creative multi-panel approach using pygal SVG charts combined with PIL compositing
  - Excellent distinct color scheme (blue/yellow/green/red) for each component
  - Realistic CO2 data scenario with proper statsmodels seasonal_decompose
  - Dual output format (PNG + interactive HTML) showcasing pygal SVG capabilities
  - Proper NaN handling in trend and residual components
  - Improved font sizes compared to previous attempt
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels display as generic Value instead of the context-specific labels
    defined in code (CO2 ppm, Trend ppm, etc.) - y_title appears not to render correctly
    in pygal
  - Text is still somewhat small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas despite font size
    increases
  - Code structure is complex due to multi-chart compositing (necessary workaround
    for pygal lack of native subplots)
