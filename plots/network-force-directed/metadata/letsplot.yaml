review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed layout algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold)
    with proper cooling schedule
  - Clear visual separation of the three community clusters demonstrating the algorithm
    effectiveness
  - Node size scaling by degree provides additional insight into node importance
  - Good color palette with Python Blue as primary, distinguishable and accessible
    colors
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with appropriate theming (removed axes,
    grid for clean network visualization)
  - Realistic social network scenario with meaningful team names
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned somewhat far from the main graph content, could be placed closer
  - No edge weight visualization (all edges same thickness despite spec mentioning
    optional weight)
  - HTML export could leverage lets-plot interactive features (tooltips showing node/edge
    info)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph with 50 nodes
    organized into 3 distinct community clusters. The nodes are colored by team: blue
    (#306998) for Engineering (right side), yellow (#FFD43B) for Marketing (center-bottom),
    and coral-red (#FF6B6B) for Sales (upper-left). Node sizes vary based on their
    degree (number of connections), with more connected nodes appearing larger. Gray
    edges (alpha ~0.5) connect the nodes, showing both dense intra-community connections
    and sparse inter-community bridge edges. The title "network-force-directed · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. A legend labeled "Teams" is positioned
    on the left side. The layout successfully reveals the three distinct communities
    with clear separation, demonstrating the force-directed algorithm''s ability to
    cluster connected nodes together.'

          is appropriately sized (14-16pt).

        comment: No text overlap. Nodes have some visual overlap but this is acceptable
          and even desirable for showing dense clusters.

        comment: 'Nodes are well-sized and vary by degree. Edges are visible with
          appropriate alpha. Minor deduction: some smaller nodes in dense areas could
          be slightly more visible.'

        comment: Blue, yellow, and coral-red are easily distinguishable and colorblind-safe
          (no red-green as only distinction).

        comment: Good use of canvas. Plot fills approximately 50-60% of the area.
          Slight imbalance with more whitespace on the right side.

        comment: Legend is well-placed on the left. No grid (appropriate for network).
          However, legend is somewhat isolated from the main content.

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar (ggplot + geom_*), scale_color_manual, coord_fixed,
          theme customization. Could leverage more lets-plot specific features like
          tooltips or interactivity in the HTML export.
