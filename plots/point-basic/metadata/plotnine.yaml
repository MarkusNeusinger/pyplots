review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layer composition (vline
    → errorbar → point)
  - Smart horizontal orientation makes category labels easy to read
  - Thoughtful data sorting by estimate value improves visual comprehension
  - Reference line at 7.0 provides meaningful context for interpretation
  - Proper categorical ordering preserves the sorted display
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-calibrated font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses non-standard alpha parameter in element_line (may cause warnings
    in some plotnine versions)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate chart showing product
    satisfaction scores across 8 categories. Each category (Product Quality, Product
    Variety, Customer Service, Packaging, Return Process, Website Usability, Price
    Value, Delivery Speed) is shown on the y-axis with blue circular points representing
    the mean estimate and horizontal error bars showing confidence intervals. A vertical
    dashed gray reference line is positioned at score 7.0. The x-axis shows "Satisfaction
    Score (1-10)" ranging from approximately 5.3 to 8.7. The title reads "point-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle
    gray gridlines. Categories are sorted by their estimate values from lowest (Delivery
    Speed) to highest (Product Quality).
