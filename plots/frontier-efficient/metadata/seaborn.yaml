review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including efficient
    frontier curve, scatter plot, key portfolio markers, and capital market line
  - Proper use of viridis colormap for Sharpe ratio with well-implemented colorbar
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct marker sizes and styles for different elements
  - Realistic financial data with properly constructed covariance matrix
  - Good annotation of risk-free rate point
  weaknesses:
  - Functions used for scipy optimization slightly deviate from pure KISS structure
    (though necessary)
  - Grid/legend styling could be more refined
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features beyond scatterplot
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. The main scatter plot shows approximately 300 random portfolios
    as circular markers colored by their Sharpe ratio using the viridis colormap (purple/dark
    for lower values ~0.52, through teal/green, to yellow for higher values ~0.66).
    The efficient frontier curve is rendered as a thick yellow/gold line curving upward
    from left to right, clearly distinguishing optimal portfolios. Two key portfolios
    are marked with star markers: the Min Variance Portfolio (blue star at approximately
    10% risk, 8% return) and the Max Sharpe Portfolio (red star at approximately 11%
    risk, 9.5% return). A blue dashed Capital Market Line extends from the risk-free
    rate point (0%, 2%) through the tangency portfolio. The risk-free rate is annotated
    with "Risk-Free (2%)" text. The colorbar on the right shows "Sharpe Ratio" ranging
    from ~0.52 to ~0.66. Axes are properly labeled with "Risk (Standard Deviation,
    %)" on x-axis and "Expected Return (%)" on y-axis. The title follows the correct
    format "frontier-efficient · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle with
    dashed style at alpha=0.3. The legend is positioned in the lower right corner
    with white background.'
