review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette choice with high contrast between series
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format and all required features
  - Realistic business scenario with 24 months of revenue data showing clear trends
  - Proper baseline at zero as required by spec
  - Good use of Highcharts stacking with normal stacking mode and fillOpacity for
    visibility
  - Well-configured tooltip with shared format showing all series values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend background color creates slight visual disconnection from the chart area
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (currently visible but not distracting)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing monthly revenue
    by product category from January 2023 through December 2024. Four distinct colored
    areas are stacked vertically:

    - **Blue (#306998)** - Electronics (largest area, top of stack)

    - **Yellow (#FFD43B)** - Software (second from top)

    - **Purple (#9467BD)** - Services (third from top)

    - **Cyan (#17BECF)** - Accessories (smallest, at bottom)


    The chart has clear axis labels ("Revenue ($ thousands)" on Y-axis, month labels
    on X-axis), a title "area-stacked · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Monthly
    Revenue by Product Category (2023-2024)", and a legend positioned in the top-right
    corner. The stacked areas show cumulative totals reaching peaks around 625 in
    Dec 2023 and 735 in Dec 2024. The baseline starts at zero and the chart effectively
    demonstrates both individual category contributions and overall trends.'
