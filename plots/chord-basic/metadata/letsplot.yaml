review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent chord diagram construction using geom_polygon with smooth Bezier curves
  - Clean implementation building polygons mathematically for both arcs and chords
  - Perfect square format (1200x1200 base, scaled 3x) for circular visualization
  - Realistic migration flow data with bidirectional flows between 6 continents
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.55) for chord overlap visibility
  - Well-positioned labels outside the ring with bold formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Title format could better follow the spec-id pattern (title text after the standard
    format)
  - Chord colors only show source color; adding gradient or target indication would
    improve bidirectional flow clarity
  image_description: The plot displays a chord diagram showing migration flows between
    6 continents arranged in a circle. Asia (blue) is positioned at the top-right,
    Europe (yellow) at top-left, Africa (green) at center-left, North America (red)
    at bottom, South America (purple) at bottom-right, and Oceania (teal) at right.
    Curved chords connect the continents with varying widths proportional to flow
    magnitude. The thickest chords appear between Asia-Europe, Africa-Europe, and
    South America-North America. Labels are positioned outside the ring in bold dark
    text. A horizontal legend at the bottom identifies all continents. The title "Migration
    Flows Between Continents · chord-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The background is white/clean.
