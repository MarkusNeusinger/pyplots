review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent isometric 3D projection implementation with proper depth sorting (back-to-front
    rendering)
  - Good use of Viridis colorblind-safe palette for Z-value encoding
  - Size variation based on depth creates effective 3D perspective illusion
  - Clean custom axis rendering with arrows and labels
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data organization
  - Saves both PNG and HTML outputs as expected for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Interactive toolbar is disabled (toolbar_location=None, tools="") - Bokeh strengths
    include interactivity; at minimum pan/zoom should be enabled for HTML output
  - Axis labels are generic X, Y, Z rather than descriptive labels with context or
    units
  - Data clusters are slightly off-center in the layout, leaving unused space on the
    right
