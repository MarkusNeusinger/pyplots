review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data generation with trend, weekly cyclical pattern, and noise
  - Clean ggplot2-style code using geom_area and geom_line combination
  - Proper export with scale=3 for high resolution (4800x2700 px)
  - Semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.4) for good readability as spec recommends
  - Saves both PNG and HTML for interactive version
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 0 creating large empty space below data (consider starting from
    minimum value or using scale_y_continuous with limits)
  - Uses numeric day_num instead of actual dates; could use scale_x_datetime for proper
    date axis formatting
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (add alpha to panel_grid)
  image_description: The plot shows a basic area chart displaying daily website visitors
    over 30 days. The filled area uses a semi-transparent blue color (#306998 with
    alpha 0.4), with a darker blue line (same color, size=2) tracing the top boundary
    of the area. The chart has a light gray dashed grid in the background. The title
    "area-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis is labeled
    "Day of Month" (ranging from 0 to 30), and the y-axis is labeled "Daily Visitors"
    (ranging from 0 to 8,000). The data shows a realistic pattern with an upward trend
    over the month, weekly cyclical variations (approximately 7-day periods visible
    as peaks and valleys), and some random noise. Values start around 5,000 visitors
    and end near 7,500.
