review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of contour plot using heatmap + line series overlay
    approach
  - White contour lines with black shadow provide superior visibility across all color
    values
  - Well-implemented marching squares algorithm for smooth contour extraction
  - Proper viridis colormap (colorblind-safe) with clearly visible colorbar
  - Contour level annotations are clean and well-positioned
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Highcharts interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines configured in code are not visible in the final output
  - Contour labels cluster in the lower-left peak area, minor readability concern
  - Code uses helper functions which deviates from KISS structure (though justified
    for algorithm complexity)
