review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation using Cartesian coordinates to simulate polar
    projection (plotnine lacks native polar coordinates)
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach with multiple geom layers for gridlines, spokes,
    data points, and labels
  - Realistic wind data with prevailing directions (SW and NE clusters) that demonstrate
    real-world wind patterns
  - Good use of alpha transparency to handle point overlap in dense regions
  - Proper compass orientation with 0° at North and clockwise angles
  - Clear visual hierarchy with bold compass labels and subtle gridlines
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" not "Wind
    Direction and Speed · polar-scatter · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
  - Figure size is 12x12 (square) at 300 DPI = 3600x3600 which is valid, but the recommended
    16:9 landscape might provide better label spacing
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area to reduce whitespace on the
    right
