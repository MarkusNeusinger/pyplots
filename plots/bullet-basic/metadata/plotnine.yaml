review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bullet chart using plotnine grammar of graphics approach
  - Grayscale bands follow spec recommendation for keeping focus on the primary measure
    bar
  - Good data normalization approach to display metrics with different scales on a
    common percentage axis
  - Clean, well-commented code structure with clear separation of data preparation
    and plotting
  - Proper use of geom_segment for the target marker perpendicular to the bar as specified
  - Actual values displayed as text labels for precise reading as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend or annotation explaining what the grayscale bands (Poor/Satisfactory/Good)
    represent
  image_description: The plot displays four horizontal bullet charts for business
    KPIs (Revenue, Profit, New Orders, Satisfaction). Each chart features three grayscale
    background bands representing qualitative ranges (Poor=dark gray, Satisfactory=medium
    gray, Good=light gray), a blue bar (#306998) showing the actual performance value,
    and a black vertical line marking the target. The actual values (275.0, 22.0,
    1050.0, 4.5) are displayed in blue text to the right of each bar. The x-axis shows
    "Performance (%)" with tick marks at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100. The title "bullet-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top.
