review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of hierarchical drill-down concept with 3 clear
    panels
  - Clean and professional color scheme using Blues colormap
  - Yellow highlight borders effectively show drill-down targets
  - Breadcrumb navigation clearly shows hierarchical path at each level
  - Good use of matplotlib patches and collections for custom shapes
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar uses generic Low/Medium/High labels instead of showing actual value ranges
    with units
  - Abstract rectangles do not convey geographic shapes (specification mentions choropleth-style
    maps)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3-panel hierarchical drill-down visualization
    showing sales data. Panel 1 ("Level 1: Regions") shows 6 world regions (N.AM,
    EUR, ASIA, AFR, S.AM, OCE) as rounded rectangles in a Blues colormap, with N.AM
    highlighted in yellow border. Panel 2 ("Level 2: States") shows 10 US states (CA,
    WA, TX, FL, IL, NY, PA, OH, GA, MI) with CA highlighted in yellow. Panel 3 ("Level
    3: Cities") shows 10 California cities (LA, SF, SD, SJ, SAC, OAK, FRE, LB, SM,
    IRV). Yellow arrows connect the panels indicating drill-down flow. Each panel
    has breadcrumb navigation below ("World", "World > United States", "World > United
    States > California"). A colorbar on the right shows "Sales Value (relative)"
    from Low to High. The main title follows the required format: "map-drilldown-geographic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
