review:
  strengths:
  - Accurate EAN-13 encoding with proper L/G/R code tables and first-digit pattern
    selection
  - Clean visual design with professional styling (shadow, rounded corners)
  - Correct placement of guard bars extending below data bars
  - Human-readable digits properly positioned with first digit outside the barcode
  - Good use of Highcharts ecosystem for HTML generation and Selenium for PNG export
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions which slightly deviates from KISS principle (though justified
    for EAN-13 complexity)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an EAN-13 barcode for the German product code
    "4006381333931". The visualization shows a white background with a centered barcode
    container featuring a subtle shadow. The title "barcode-ean13 · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in blue (#306998), with a gray subtitle showing "EAN-13: 4006381333931".
    The barcode itself consists of black vertical bars of varying widths on a white
    background, with guard bars (start, center, end) extending slightly lower than
    the data bars. Human-readable digits are displayed below the barcode with the
    first digit "4" positioned outside the left guard pattern, followed by "006381"
    on the left side and "333931" on the right side, separated by the center guard.
    The barcode is enclosed in a white container with rounded corners and a subtle
    box shadow.'
