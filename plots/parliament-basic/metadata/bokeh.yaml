review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular seat arrangement with 8 concentric arcs
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with distinct hues
  - Clean legend showing party names with seat counts
  - Proper majority threshold annotation
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and Legend models
  - Dual output format (PNG and HTML)
  - White edge highlighting on seats improves visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Seat dots could be marginally larger to better fill the canvas space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    400 total seats arranged in 8 concentric arcs. Individual seats are rendered as
    colored dots with white borders. The visualization uses 6 political parties: Progressive
    Alliance (85 seats, red), Green Coalition (42, green), Center Party (58, yellow),
    Liberal Democrats (67, dark red/maroon), Conservative Union (92, purple), and
    National Front (56, darker purple). The seats flow from left to right through
    the semicircle, with each party''s seats appearing consecutively. A horizontal
    legend at the bottom shows all parties with their seat counts. The title "parliament-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center, and "Majority threshold: 201
    seats (Total: 400)" annotation is displayed below the semicircle.'
