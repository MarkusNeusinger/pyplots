review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bullet chart pattern using Altair layering capability
  - Grayscale bands follow spec recommendation for keeping focus on primary measure
  - Smart normalization approach to show multiple metrics with different scales on
    common axis
  - Clean separation of data preparation and visualization code
  - Title format exactly matches specification
  - Realistic business KPI scenario with meaningful metric labels
  weaknesses:
  - Vertical spacing between bullet charts is quite large, reducing the compact design
    benefit mentioned in spec
  - 'Does not display actual values as text labels on the bars (spec notes: Consider
    adding the actual value as a text label)'
  - Could leverage Altair interactivity features (tooltips showing original values)
