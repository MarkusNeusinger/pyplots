review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of asymmetric error bars demonstrating the feature mentioned
    in the spec
  - Clear experimental/clinical trial context with Control and Treatment groups
  - Proper error bar styling with visible caps (capsize=10) and appropriate line thickness
  - Perfect adherence to matplotlib style guide (Axes methods, proper font sizes,
    tight_layout)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Could showcase more matplotlib-specific features like error bar color gradients
    or connecting lines between points
  - Y-axis only grid is acceptable but full grid could enhance readability
  image_description: The plot displays 6 experimental groups (Control, Treatment A
    through E) on the x-axis with their response values on the y-axis (ranging from
    0 to ~55 units). Each group is represented by a blue circular marker (#306998
    color) with vertical error bars extending above and below. The error bars have
    visible caps at both ends. Treatment C and D show asymmetric error bars - Treatment
    C has a notably larger lower error bar, while Treatment D has a larger upper range.
    The title "errorbar-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top.
    The y-axis is labeled "Response Value (units)" and x-axis is labeled "Experimental
    Group". A subtle horizontal dashed grid (alpha=0.3) aids readability.
