review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D visualization with clear spatial separation of three distinct clusters
  - Proper use of Highcharts 3D module with scatter3d chart type and appropriate 3D
    frame styling
  - Colorblind-safe palette (Python Blue, Python Yellow, Teal) with good visual distinction
  - 'Title follows exact spec format: scatter-3d · highcharts · pyplots.ai'
  - Clean KISS structure with reproducible seed (42) and appropriate data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels with units are good but tick label font size appears slightly small
    relative to the large canvas
  - Legend markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
