review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts 3D rendering with proper alpha/beta viewing angles
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette that distinguishes all four quarters effectively
  - Professional title format and descriptive subtitle explaining the data context
  - Proper use of z-axis configuration for depth dimension
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good data generation logic
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - The z-axis Quarter label appears isolated at bottom-right corner of the chart
  - Some bars in the back are partially occluded by taller front bars - transparency
    could help
  - The interactive HTML version could include drag-to-rotate functionality for better
    exploration
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3D bar chart with 5 product categories (Laptop,
    Tablet, Phone, Monitor, Keyboard) on the x-axis extending into depth, with quarterly
    data (Q1-Q4) represented as separate colored bars along the z-axis. The y-axis
    shows Revenue ($K) from 0 to 260. The bars use a colorblind-safe palette: blue
    (#306998) for Q1, yellow (#FFD43B) for Q2, purple (#9467BD) for Q3, and cyan (#17BECF)
    for Q4. The title "bar-3d · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold,
    with a subtitle showing the data context. The 3D perspective is applied with a
    moderate viewing angle (alpha=15, beta=20), creating depth perception. A vertical
    legend in the upper-right corner identifies each quarter. The Phone category shows
    the tallest bars (especially Q2 at ~235), while Keyboard shows the shortest values
    (~30-50). The 3D effect shows bars arranged in depth with proper occlusion.'

        comment: Good use of Highcharts 3D module (options3d, alpha, beta, depth,
          viewDistance), but could leverage more interactivity features in the HTML
          version like drag rotation
  verdict: APPROVED
