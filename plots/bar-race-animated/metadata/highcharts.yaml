review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of small multiples grid approach for static output as
    spec recommends
  - Consistent color coding per company across all time periods enables tracking
  - Clear data labels with dollar formatting ($XXB) on each bar
  - Good use of Highcharts styling options (margins, font sizes, borders)
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic tech company market value scenario with plausible evolution
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full resolution
  - Some panels show only 9 companies instead of consistent 10 (visible in 2022 panel)
  - The individual panel charts have excessive dimensions (1520x1280) that get scaled
    down significantly in the grid view
  image_description: The plot displays a 2x3 grid of small multiple bar charts showing
    "Technology Companies Market Value Evolution (2019-2024)" with the main title
    "bar-race-animated · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top. Each panel represents
    a different year (2019-2024) with horizontal bar charts showing top 10 technology
    companies by market value. Bars are color-coded consistently per company (e.g.,
    TechCorp Alpha in pink/magenta, DataSphere in teal, QuantumByte in yellow, etc.).
    Each bar has a data label showing the value in $B format. The bars are sorted
    by value within each panel, and you can observe ranking changes across years -
    for example, TechCorp Alpha leads in 2019 but DataSphere overtakes by 2024. The
    Y-axis shows company names and X-axis shows "Market Value ($B)" ranging from 0-400.
    Each panel has a subtle gray background with white chart background, bordered
    with rounded corners.
