review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stem plot implementation using creative combination of LineSeries for
    stems and ScatterSeries for markers
  - Clean baseline implementation using plotLines feature
  - Good color choice (#306998) with white marker borders for visibility
  - 'Appropriate data: damped oscillation demonstrates both positive and negative
    stems well'
  - Proper use of container.screenshot() for exact dimensions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Amplitude (a.u.)" or "Sample Index (n)")
  - Image height is 2661px instead of exactly 2700px (minor dimension discrepancy)
  image_description: The plot displays a stem plot showing a damped oscillation signal
    with 30 data points. Each data point is represented by a blue (#306998) circular
    marker connected to the y=0 baseline by a thin vertical stem line. The title "stem-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Sample Index"
    (0-29) and the y-axis is labeled "Amplitude" (ranging from approximately -0.8
    to 1.15). The plot shows a classic damped oscillation pattern starting with high
    amplitude (~1.0) and decaying over time with alternating positive and negative
    values. A subtle grid is visible with light gray lines. The baseline at y=0 is
    clearly marked with a darker horizontal line.

        comment: Markers are appropriately sized (radius 10) with good visibility.
          Stems are thin but clearly visible. 30 data points with this marker size
          is optimal.
