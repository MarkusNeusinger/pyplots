review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of PDP with confidence intervals computed from individual
    conditional expectations
  - Includes rug plot using plotLines to show training data distribution
  - Centers partial dependence at zero for easier interpretation as recommended in
    spec
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme using Python Blue (#306998)
  - Proper use of AreaRangeSeries for the confidence band
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned in top-right corner with significant empty space between
    it and the data area
  - Rug plot lines could be slightly thicker or more prominent at the bottom of the
    plot rather than spanning full height
  - Could add more descriptive tooltip content showing exact values
