review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic hourly temperature data showing clear cyclical pattern
    (warm midday, cool night)
  - Proper polar chart implementation with clockwise direction and top-starting position
    for time-based data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  - Good canvas utilization with the polar chart filling the space well
  - Correct title format and appropriate radial axis label with units
  weaknesses:
  - The baseline reference circle at r=0 adds unnecessary visual noise and code complexity
  - Grid opacity (0.35) is slightly high; could be more subtle at 0.25-0.3
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover templates
  image_description: The plot displays a polar chart showing 24-hour temperature data.
    The chart has a circular layout with hour labels (0h through 22h) positioned around
    the perimeter at 2-hour intervals, starting from the top (0h/midnight). The radial
    axis shows temperature values from 0 to 25°C with the label "Temperature (°C)"
    in the center. Data points are shown as medium-sized blue markers (#306998) connected
    by lines, with a light blue semi-transparent fill (toself). The pattern shows
    warmer temperatures during midday hours (10h-14h reaching ~20-25°C) and cooler
    temperatures at night (~5-10°C around 22h-4h). The title "polar-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The background is white with subtle gray grid
    lines.

        comment: 'Title, axis labels, and tick labels are all readable. Font sizes

        comment: No overlapping text elements. Hour labels are well-spaced around
          the perimeter.

        max: 8
        passed: true
        comment: Markers are visible and appropriately sized (16px). Lines connect
          clearly. Fill provides good area visualization. Slightly larger markers
          would improve visibility.

          No colorblind issues.

        comment: Polar chart fills the canvas well. Balanced margins. Good use of
          space.

        name: Grid & Legend
        score: 0
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: Grid is visible but slightly too prominent (alpha 0.35 is higher
          than recommended 0.2-0.4 range ceiling). Legend is hidden which is appropriate
          for single series, but the baseline trace at r=0 is unnecessary and adds
          visual noise.

        comment: Shows cyclical temperature pattern well with day/night variation.
          Could benefit from showing both the cyclical nature AND some anomalies or
          multiple data series to better demonstrate polar chart capabilities.

        comment: Hourly temperature readings is an excellent, realistic application.
          The sinusoidal pattern with noise mimics real daily temperature cycles.

        comment: Saves as plot.png AND plot.html (both correct), but the baseline
          trace at r=0 is unnecessary code.

        passed: true
        comment: Uses Scatterpolar correctly with fill="toself" for area visualization.
          Saves both PNG and HTML for interactivity. However, could leverage more
          Plotly-specific features like hover customization or animation.
  verdict: APPROVED
