review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of real-world data scenario (human heights by gender) with realistic
    statistical parameters
  - Proper use of pygal native Histogram class with correct tuple format (height,
    start, end)
  - Good transparency setting (opacity=0.5) allows overlapping regions to be clearly
    visible
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate comments
  - Font sizes well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text Female collides with X-axis title Height (cm) - needs increased margin_bottom
    or adjusted legend positioning
  - Does not leverage pygal distinctive interactive features (tooltips, value formatters,
    custom hover effects) that differentiate it from static libraries
  image_description: 'The plot displays two overlapping histograms comparing height
    distributions by gender. The Male distribution (blue/steel color) is centered
    around 175cm with a peak frequency of ~42, while the Female distribution (yellow/gold
    color) is centered around 160cm with a peak frequency of ~40. Both distributions
    use semi-transparent fills (approximately 50% opacity), allowing the overlapping
    region (around 160-175cm) to show a darker olive/brown blend color. The title
    "histogram-overlapping · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clean sans-serif
    font. The X-axis is labeled "Height (cm)" ranging from 140-200, and the Y-axis
    shows "Frequency" from 0-40+. A legend at the bottom identifies "Male" and "Female"
    series. The plot has subtle horizontal grid lines and uses the pyplots color scheme
    (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B).'

        comment: 'Histogram bars are clearly visible. The overlapping region shows
          both distributions well due to good transparency. Minor deduction: the overlap
          blend color could be slightly more distinct.'

        comment: Legend text "Female" overlaps with X-axis title "Height (cm)". The
          legend placement at bottom causes a collision.

          like tooltips, custom formatters, or interactive configurations that would
          enhance the SVG output.
  verdict: APPROVED
