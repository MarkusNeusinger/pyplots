review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent compass-oriented polar layout with North at top (rotation=90, clockwise
    direction)
  - Realistic wind data with clear prevailing direction clusters (NW and SE)
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-friendly (blue/yellow/orange)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-sized markers with white borders improve visibility
  - Both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Clean, readable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis label positioned at center can overlap with dense data points
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area
  - Could add custom hover templates to show exact wind direction and speed values
  - Minor whitespace imbalance on the left side of the canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar scatter chart showing wind observations.
    The chart features a circular layout with North (N 0°) at the top, East (E 90°)
    on the right, South (S 180°) at the bottom, and West (W 270°) on the left, with
    intermediate directions (NE, SE, SW, NW) also labeled. Data points are colored
    by time of day: blue for Morning, yellow for Afternoon, and orange for Evening.
    The radial axis shows "Wind Speed (m/s)" ranging from 0 to 25. Two main clusters
    of points are visible - one in the Northwest quadrant and another in the Southeast
    quadrant, representing prevailing wind directions. The title reads "Wind Observations
    · polar-scatter · plotly · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper right shows the
    "Time of Day" categories. The markers have good size (approximately 14px) with
    white borders and slight transparency (0.75 opacity).'
