review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution (Treatment B) showcasing why raincloud
    plots are superior to box plots alone
  - Clean color palette with Python-themed colors that are colorblind accessible
  - Rich hover information with custom templates showing median, quartiles, and mean±std
  - Proper implementation of all three raincloud components using Plotly's violin
    with side parameter
  - Good use of outliers to demonstrate box plot whiskers
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only displays Cloud components, hiding the Stats and Rain labels (showlegend=False)
    which reduces clarity about the three-component structure
  - Grid line configuration could be more prominent (currently very subtle rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
