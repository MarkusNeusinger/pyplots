review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent axis alignment between scatter and marginal plots using shared x_range/y_range
  - Clean visual design with Python blue/yellow color scheme that is colorblind-safe
  - Well-proportioned layout with marginals at ~20% of dimensions
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) for scatter points revealing density patterns
  - Subtle grid styling (alpha=0.3, dashed) that does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without units or meaningful context
  - Scatter point size (18) could be slightly larger for better visibility on this
    canvas
  - Empty corner placeholder could be utilized for annotation or removed more elegantly
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with marginal distributions
    using Bokeh. The main scatter plot (lower-left) shows approximately 200 blue data
    points (#306998 Python blue) with moderate transparency (alpha ~0.65) displaying
    a positive correlation. The top marginal shows a histogram of the X distribution
    in yellow bars (#FFD43B Python yellow) with blue outlines, roughly bell-shaped
    and centered around 50. The right marginal shows a horizontal histogram of the
    Y distribution, also in yellow with blue outlines. The title "scatter-marginal
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left of the main scatter plot. Axes are
    labeled "X Value" and "Y Value" with "Count" labels on the marginals. Grid lines
    are subtle with dashed styling. There's an empty corner placeholder in the top-right.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, figure range linking for axis alignment, quad
          glyphs for histograms. Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like
          hover tools or linked selections.
  verdict: APPROVED
