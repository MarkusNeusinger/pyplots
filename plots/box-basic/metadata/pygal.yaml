review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choice with realistic salary distributions across departments
  - Proper use of Tukey box mode for standard box plot visualization
  - Clean implementation of outliers in Engineering and Sales departments
  - Good color palette that is accessible and visually distinct
  - Correct title format and proper axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box size is small relative to the large chart dimensions, making it less
    prominent
  - Outlier markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at this resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box plot (box-and-whisker) showing salary
    distributions across 5 departments: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales
    (green), Operations (orange), and HR (purple). Each department has a distinct
    colored box showing the interquartile range with a median line. Whiskers extend
    to show the data range, and outliers are displayed as small dots outside the whiskers.
    The title "box-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis shows
    "Salary ($)" ranging from 0 to ~135,000, and the x-axis label "Department" appears
    at the bottom. A legend at the bottom identifies each department color. The background
    is white with subtle horizontal grid lines.'
