review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using sns.lineplot with units parameter to draw individual
    arrow segments
  - Clean implementation of arrowheads using trigonometric calculations
  - Viridis colormap with colorbar effectively shows magnitude variation
  - Proper aspect ratio (equal) for vector field visualization
  - Well-scaled arrows that do not overlap but remain visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be X Position (units) or similar context-specific
    labeling)
  - Data context is purely mathematical rather than tied to a real-world application
    (e.g., wind field, fluid flow)
  image_description: The plot displays a 15×15 grid of arrows representing a circular
    rotation vector field (u = -y, v = x). Arrows are colored using the viridis colormap
    based on vector magnitude—purple/dark blue near the center (low magnitude ~0)
    transitioning to yellow at the corners (high magnitude ~4.2). The arrows point
    tangentially around the origin, creating a clear counter-clockwise rotation pattern.
    The title "quiver-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large font.
    Axes are labeled "X Position" and "Y Position" with tick marks from -3 to 3. A
    colorbar on the right displays "Vector Magnitude" (0.0-4.2). The plot has a clean
    white background with subtle dashed grid lines (alpha ~0.3). All arrows are uniformly
    spaced and clearly visible with arrowheads.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with units parameter creatively to draw separate
          arrow segments, and sns.set_theme for styling. However, seaborn doesn't
          have a native quiver function, so the implementation cleverly works around
          this limitation using line segments.
  verdict: APPROVED
