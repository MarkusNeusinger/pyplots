review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent code quality with clean KISS structure and idiomatic lets-plot grammar
  - Strong visual refinement with customized minimal theme, subtle gridlines, and
    explicit font sizing
  - Mean annotations with values add narrative context to the bimodal distribution
  - Dual export (PNG + HTML) with interactive tooltips leverages lets-plot distinctive
    features
  - Colorblind-safe blue/orange palette
  weaknesses:
  - The bimodal distribution story is weakened by using a single color for both populations
    — the two peaks blend visually and the histogram could be mistaken for a broad
    unimodal distribution. Consider using two overlapping semi-transparent histograms
    with different fill colors, or at minimum use color segments to differentiate
    the populations
  - X-axis limits [140, 205] are too wide for the data range, creating wasted space
    on both sides. Tighter limits would improve canvas utilization
  - The Women/Men framing, while a classic statistical example, could be replaced
    with a more neutral context (e.g., two tree species heights, two machine batches)
    to avoid any content policy sensitivity
  - Data storytelling could be stronger — annotating the overlap region or adding
    a note about the population split would make the bimodal nature more apparent
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of human heights in centimeters
    using 30 blue (#306998) bars with white edge lines on a white background. The
    x-axis spans from 140 to 205 cm labeled "Height (cm)" and the y-axis shows "Frequency"
    from 0 to approximately 65. The distribution is bimodal with visible peaks around
    165 cm and 172 cm. Two orange dashed vertical reference lines mark population
    means, annotated at the top as "Women avg 165.0 cm" and "Men avg 177.8 cm" in
    bold orange text. The title reads "histogram-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with
    subtitle "Bimodal distribution of human heights — two overlapping populations".
    Horizontal light gray gridlines provide reference; vertical gridlines are removed.
    The layout is clean and minimal.

        comment: Mean annotations with values and subtitle provide narrative context.
          However bimodal nature is not visually obvious — looks like broad unimodal
          distribution at first glance.
