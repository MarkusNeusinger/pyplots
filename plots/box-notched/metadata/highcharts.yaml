review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent clinical trial context with dose-response relationship clearly visible
  - Creative use of error bars to represent notch confidence intervals
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette
  - Proper outlier visualization as separate scatter series
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Informative subtitle explaining the 95% CI notation
  weaknesses:
  - Notches represented as error bars rather than actual notched box shape (Highcharts
    limitation, acceptable workaround)
  - Legend text slightly small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas
  image_description: 'The plot shows a notched box plot visualization with four treatment
    groups: Placebo, Low Dose, Medium Dose, and High Dose arranged along the x-axis.
    Each box uses a different color (blue for Placebo, yellow for Low Dose, purple
    for Medium Dose, cyan for High Dose). The y-axis shows "Response Score" ranging
    from approximately 10 to 108. Each box displays the standard box plot elements
    (median as black line, Q1/Q3 as box boundaries, whiskers). Red horizontal error
    bars overlay each box representing the 95% CI (notch) for median comparison. Red
    circular markers indicate outliers - visible for Placebo (at ~15 and ~85), Low
    Dose (at ~29, ~35, ~74, ~79), and Medium Dose (at ~30 and ~95). The title reads
    "box-notched · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the error bars.
    A legend in the upper right shows Response Distribution, 95% CI (Notch), and Outliers.'
