review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling showing realistic renewable energy market evolution
  - Perfect normalization to 100% throughout the time series
  - Clear visual hierarchy with well-chosen colors that are distinguishable
  - Good use of seaborn theming (whitegrid style, talk context)
  - Boundary lines between areas add visual clarity
  - Title format exactly matches specification requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Other top-to-bottom) is reversed from visual
    stack order (Other, Hydro, Wind, Solar bottom-to-top), which can confuse readers
