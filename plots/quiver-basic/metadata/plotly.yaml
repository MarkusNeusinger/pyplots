review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly figure_factory.create_quiver for native quiver plot support
  - Good combination of arrows with scatter markers for magnitude encoding
  - Proper Viridis colorscale for colorblind accessibility
  - Interactive hover templates provide detailed information
  - HTML output enables full plotly interactivity
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate 15x15 grid density for visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra descriptor before spec-id format
  - Axis labels lack units
  - Zero lines are slightly more prominent than grid lines
  - X-axis range extends unnecessarily wide when data only spans -2 to 2
