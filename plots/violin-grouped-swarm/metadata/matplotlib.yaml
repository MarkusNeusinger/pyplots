review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of grouped violins with proper dodging/positioning
  - Custom swarm-like jitter algorithm approximates beeswarm behavior well
  - Clear visual distinction between Novice and Expert groups
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.5) on violins makes swarm points visible
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful patterns (experts faster than novices)
  - Correct title format and professional styling
  weaknesses:
  - Swarm point size (s=40) could be slightly larger (s=60-80) for better visibility
    at this data density
  - Grid styling could include both axes or be more subtle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm overlay showing
    response times across three task complexity levels (Simple, Moderate, Complex)
    for two expertise groups (Novice and Expert). Blue (#306998) violins represent
    Novice users and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) violins represent Expert users. Each violin
    has individual data points overlaid as filled circles with black edges. The violins
    have ~50% transparency allowing swarm points to be visible. Black horizontal lines
    mark the median for each violin. The title follows the correct format "violin-grouped-swarm
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. X-axis shows "Task Complexity" with three
    categories, Y-axis shows "Response Time (seconds)" ranging from 0 to ~6.5. A legend
    in the upper left shows the Expertise grouping with colored rectangles. A subtle
    dashed grid appears on the y-axis. The data shows expected patterns: Novice users
    have higher response times than Experts, and response times increase with task
    complexity for both groups.'
