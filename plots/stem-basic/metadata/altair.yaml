review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stem plot using Altair declarative approach with layered
    marks (baseline + stems + markers)
  - Creative use of mark_rule with y/y2 encoding to create stems from baseline to
    data points
  - Good marker visibility with white stroke providing contrast against stems
  - Interactive tooltips showing sample index and amplitude values
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate data representing a damped oscillation signal with clear visual decay
    pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Amplitude (a.u.) or Sample Index (n))
  - Data scenario could be more specific (e.g., audio sample, ECG signal) rather than
    generic damped oscillation
