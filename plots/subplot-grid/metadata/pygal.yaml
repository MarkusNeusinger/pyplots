review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of pygal versatility with four distinct chart types (Line,
    Bar, XY scatter, Histogram) in a cohesive grid
  - Creative solution for subplot grid using PIL composition since pygal lacks native
    subplots
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with interconnected metrics (revenue, sales,
    advertising ROI, order volume)
  - 'Proper use of Python brand colors (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) maintaining
    visual consistency'
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated, showcasing pygal web-native SVG
    capabilities
  - Clean, readable axis labels with appropriate units throughout all subplots
  weaknesses:
  - Chart titles repeat y-axis information (e.g., Monthly Revenue title + Revenue
    y-label) - could be more concise
  - Scatter plot dots could be slightly larger for improved visibility at the 30-point
    density level
  - Code structure uses loops for chart rendering which adds slight complexity beyond
    pure KISS style
  image_description: "The plot displays a 2x2 grid of four distinct charts with a\
    \ main title \"subplot-grid · pygal · pyplots.ai\" centered at the top in dark\
    \ gray text. \n\n**Top-left**: Line chart titled \"Monthly Revenue ($K)\" showing\
    \ an upward trend from January (~120K) to December (~248K). Blue line with visible\
    \ data point markers, gray gridlines, x-axis labeled \"Month\" and y-axis labeled\
    \ \"Revenue ($K)\".\n\n**Top-right**: Bar chart titled \"Sales by Category ($K)\"\
    \ with five golden/yellow vertical bars representing Electronics (~45K), Apparel\
    \ (~33K), Home (~28K), Sports (~20K), and Books (~15K). X-axis labeled \"Category\"\
    , y-axis labeled \"Sales ($K)\".\n\n**Bottom-left**: Scatter plot titled \"Ad\
    \ Spend vs Return on Investment\" showing ~30 blue dots distributed across the\
    \ chart. X-axis labeled \"Ad Spend ($K)\" ranging 0-50, y-axis labeled \"ROI (%)\"\
    \ ranging 0-6. Shows positive correlation trend.\n\n**Bottom-right**: Histogram\
    \ titled \"Daily Order Volume Distribution\" with golden/yellow bars showing a\
    \ roughly normal distribution of daily orders. X-axis labeled \"Orders per Day\"\
    \ (60-280 range), y-axis labeled \"Frequency\" (0-70 range). Peak frequency around\
    \ 150-160 orders.\n\nOverall: Clean white background, light gray plot backgrounds\
    \ (#fafafa), consistent styling across all charts, well-balanced layout with equal\
    \ cell sizes."

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate; no legends needed (single series
          per chart), but some charts could benefit from guide lines.
