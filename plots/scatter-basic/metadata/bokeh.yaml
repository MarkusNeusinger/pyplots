  strengths:

  - Realistic educational data scenario (study hours vs exam scores)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size=50 is slightly too large for 100 points, causing visual density issues
    in clustered regions
  - No legend to identify the data series (minor for single-series plot)
