review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style calendar heatmap visualization with clear weekday and month
    structure
  - Realistic data generation with patterns (weekday vs weekend, sprint periods, summer
    slowdown)
  - Clean sequential color gradient that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper handling of ISO week numbering edge cases at year boundaries
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  - Good text sizing throughout (title 26pt bold, axis text 18pt, legend 16-18pt)
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some unused space on the right side that could be better utilized
  - Weekday ordering shows Monday at top rather than following the spec suggested
    Sunday at top pattern
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot for better visual balance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a calendar heatmap for "Daily Activity 2024"
    with a GitHub-style contribution graph layout. The y-axis shows weekdays from
    Sunday at the bottom to Monday at the top (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun).
    The x-axis displays month labels (Jan through Dec). Each day is represented as
    a rectangular tile with color intensity indicating contribution count. The color
    scale uses a sequential gradient from light gray (#ebedf0) for zero/low activity
    to Python Blue (#306998) for high activity (up to 15 contributions). The legend
    shows "Contributions" with a scale from 0 to 15. White borders separate the tiles.
    The title reads "Daily Activity 2024 · heatmap-calendar · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    in bold. Clear patterns are visible: weekends (Sat/Sun) show lighter colors indicating
    lower activity, while Q2 and Q4 months (Mar-Apr, Sep-Oct) show darker colors indicating
    higher activity periods. Summer months (Jul-Aug) appear lighter.'
