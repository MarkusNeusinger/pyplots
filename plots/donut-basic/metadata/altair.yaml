review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered composition to combine donut segments, percentage
    labels, and center text
  - Clean declarative syntax with proper encoding types (theta, color, text)
  - Interactive tooltips enhance user experience in HTML output
  - White stroke between segments improves visual separation
  - Center text effectively displays total budget metric as specified
  - Well-proportioned ring width for readability
  weaknesses:
  - The two blue colors (Marketing and Operations) are somewhat similar and could
    be more distinct
  - Percentage labels on very small segments may be harder to read at smaller display
    sizes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart with 5 colored segments representing
    budget allocation by department. The segments are: Marketing (28%, dark blue),
    Development (35%, yellow), Operations (18%, light blue), Sales (12%, gray), and
    Support (7%, sage green). White percentage labels appear on each segment. The
    hollow center contains "Total: $100M" in blue text. The title "donut-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is positioned at the top center. A legend with category names and
    colored circles is placed on the right side. White stroke separates segments for
    clarity.'

        comment: Title, legend, and center text are clearly readable. Percentage labels
          on segments are legible but slightly small on smaller segments.

          layering for text overlays, tooltips for interactivity, proper encoding
          with theta channel.'
