review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  - Clean layout with good vertical space utilization for multiple series
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with distinct patterns per server
  - Proper use of seaborn styling features (set_style, set_context, despine, color_palette)
  - Good reproducibility with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Only displays blue bands (positive) - the red bands for negative values are not
    visible in the rendered image despite code attempting to generate them
  - Title includes extra Server CPU Usage prefix instead of using the exact spec-id
    format
  - Legend terminology mismatch between code comments and visual representation
