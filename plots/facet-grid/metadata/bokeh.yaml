review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh gridplot for creating the faceted layout
  - Good color-coding by region with colorblind-friendly palette
  - Clean facet labels in each subplot identifying region and season
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal variation in sales data
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data binding
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low alpha
  weaknesses:
  - Individual figure dimensions (1500x600 each) result in non-standard total size;
    should target 4800x2700 total
  - Title figure approach is awkward; could use Div or Title model for cleaner implementation
  - Yellow markers (#FFD43B) have reduced visibility against the light gray background
  - Missing an explicit legend that explains the color-region mapping
