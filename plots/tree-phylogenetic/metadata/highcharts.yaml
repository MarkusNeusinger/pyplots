review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts organization chart module with proper hierarchical
    data structure
  - Clean color-coded level differentiation (dark blue → medium blue → light blue
    → yellow for species)
  - Good title format following spec-id convention
  - Informative tooltips with taxonomic rank information
  - Proper use of inverted chart for top-down tree layout
  - Realistic primate phylogeny data with correct taxonomic relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Two species (Hylobates lar, Symphalangus) are incorrectly positioned at the subfamily
    level instead of the bottom species row
  - Missing branch lengths proportional to evolutionary distance as specified
  - Missing scale bar to indicate evolutionary distance units
  - Text on yellow species nodes could be larger for better legibility
  - Does not parse Newick format as suggested in spec (uses manual node/edge definition
    instead)
