review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and visual appeal
  - Clever hybrid approach combining plotnine geom_tile with matplotlib contour overlay
    for precise level identification
  - Well-chosen mathematical function demonstrating multiple peaks and a valley for
    comprehensive feature coverage
  - Proper text sizing following library guidelines (14pt base, 20pt axis titles,
    24pt title)
  - Clean separation of data generation and visualization code
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib contour function directly instead of pure plotnine (acceptable
    workaround but reduces library-native score)
  - Axis labels lack units (though Coordinate is descriptive for mathematical domain)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a filled contour visualization of a 2D scalar
    field using the viridis colormap. The background is a blue-green gradient representing
    lower values (around -0.25 to 0.25), with several peaks visible as bright yellow
    regions. There are three main peaks: a bright yellow peak in the upper right quadrant
    (around coordinates 1, 1), a yellow-green peak in the lower left quadrant (around
    -1.2, -1), and a smaller peak in the lower right (around 1.5, -1.5). A purple
    valley/dip is visible in the upper left area (around -0.5, 1.5) representing negative
    values. White contour lines with labels are overlaid showing precise level values
    (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.). The colorbar on the right shows "Value" ranging from -0.25
    to 1.00. Title reads "contour-filled · plotnine · pyplots.ai", with axis labels
    "X Coordinate" and "Y Coordinate".'

        comment: Uses plotnine's ggplot grammar with geom_tile and theme system; however,
          the contour overlay uses matplotlib directly via fig.axes[0], which is a
          hybrid approach
  verdict: APPROVED
