review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of gradient fill from specification notes (alpha 0.3-0.5)
  - Proper title format exactly matching the required pattern
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of weekly cyclical pattern in data making the visualization interesting
  - Proper container-based screenshot approach for accurate chart dimensions
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 0 creating large empty space below the data (could use min property)
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Daily Visitors (count)" or "Day of Month (date)")
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like hover tooltips or animation
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing website traffic
    over 30 days. The chart has a blue color scheme (#306998) with a gradient fill
    that transitions from semi-opaque at the top (~0.5 alpha) to nearly transparent
    at the bottom (~0.1 alpha). The title "area-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is
    prominently displayed at the top in bold. The X-axis is labeled "Day of Month"
    with values from 1-30, and the Y-axis shows "Daily Visitors" ranging from 0 to
    4000. Small blue circular markers are placed at each data point along the line.
    The data shows a clear upward trend with weekly cyclical patterns (peaks roughly
    every 7 days). Grid lines are subtle and visible on both axes. The overall layout
    is clean with white background.
