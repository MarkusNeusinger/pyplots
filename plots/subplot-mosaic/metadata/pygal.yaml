review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of mosaic layout concept with 5 diverse chart types showing
    different spanning patterns (2×2, 1×1, 2×1)
  - Creative solution using PIL to composite multiple pygal charts into a cohesive
    dashboard
  - Well-designed custom style with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Bonus HTML output with interactive SVG grid demonstrates pygal web-native strength
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with coherent data narrative
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (render_chart_to_image, get_svg_content) which violates
    KISS principle for plot implementations
  - Does not demonstrate empty cell placeholder feature mentioned in spec
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a mosaic dashboard layout with 5 panels arranged in an "AAB;AAC;DDE" pattern:
    - **Panel A (top-left, 2×2)**: Line chart showing "Monthly Revenue vs Costs" with blue revenue line and yellow costs line over 12 months (Jan-Dec). Both lines show upward trends with revenue ranging ~120-218 and costs ~85-135. Dots mark data points, legend at bottom.
    - **Panel B (top-right)**: Horizontal bar chart "Sales by Category" showing 5 categories (Electronics: 450, Clothing: 320, Home: 280, Sports: 195, Books: 165) with values printed in bars using pyplots color palette.
    - **Panel C (middle-right)**: Donut chart "Regional Share" showing North (blue, ~35%), South (yellow), East (green), West (orange) with legend at bottom.
    - **Panel D (bottom-left, 2×1)**: XY scatter plot "Marketing ROI Correlation" with Marketing Spend ($K) on x-axis and Sales ($K) on y-axis, showing positive correlation with ~40 blue dots.
    - **Panel E (bottom-right)**: Half-pie solid gauge "Target Achievement" showing 78% progress with blue fill.
    - Main title "subplot-mosaic · pygal · pyplots.ai" centered at top in dark gray. White background with light gray plot backgrounds.
