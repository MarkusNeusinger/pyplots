review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of contourpy library for generating filled contours and contour
    lines, demonstrating sophisticated polygon extraction
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent accessibility and visual appeal
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs are generated, supporting Bokeh interactive capabilities
  - Clean implementation with proper handling of ChunkCombinedOffset fill type from
    contourpy
  - Appropriate 50x50 grid resolution provides smooth contour curves
  - Good axis range with buffer prevents edge clipping
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar title Z Value appears partially clipped at the right edge of the image
  - Grid lines are barely visible against the dark purple background of low-value
    regions
  - Axis labels use generic X Coordinate / Y Coordinate instead of a domain-specific
    context
