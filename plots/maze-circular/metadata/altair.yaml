review:
  strengths:
  - Well-implemented maze generation algorithm using Kruskal's randomized approach
    with union-find
  - Proper wall structure with concentric rings and radial passages
  - Clean black-on-white design suitable for printing
  - Entry gap clearly visible in outer boundary
  - Correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - START label is displayed upside-down (text rotation calculation needs adjustment
    for bottom position)
  - Goal star marker at center is too small relative to maze size
  - Maze appears slightly elliptical rather than perfectly circular (aspect ratio
    not enforced perfectly)
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze with 7 concentric rings, black
    walls on a white background. The maze features a clear structure with concentric
    ring corridors connected by radial passages. At the center is a yellow star marker
    (goal), though it appears very small with an unexpected "OA" text overlaid on
    it. At the bottom of the maze, outside the outer boundary, is a "START" label
    in blue text - however, it appears upside-down (rotated 180 degrees from the expected
    readable orientation). The title "maze-circular · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top in black text. The maze itself is well-formed with proper wall thickness
    and clear passages. There is an entry gap visible in the outer ring near the bottom
    where the START label is positioned.
