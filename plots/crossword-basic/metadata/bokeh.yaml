review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 180-degree rotational symmetry for black cells
  - Clean, professional newspaper-style appearance with proper cell borders
  - Correct clue numbering algorithm identifying across and down word starts
  - Perfect square format choice (3600x3600) matching the 1:1 cell aspect ratio requirement
  - Uses ColumnDataSource pattern appropriately for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Clue numbers (16pt) could be slightly larger for better legibility at full resolution
  - Does not leverage Bokeh distinctive interactive features (hover tooltips, clickable
    cells)
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with the correct
    title format "crossword-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top. The grid shows
    white entry cells with light gray borders and dark black blocking cells (#1a1a1a).
    Clue numbers (1-67) are positioned in the top-left corner of cells that start
    across or down words. The black cells follow 180-degree rotational symmetry, creating
    a traditional newspaper-style crossword pattern. The background is a subtle light
    gray (#f5f5f5), and the overall layout is clean with square cells. The grid uses
    the square format (3600x3600) which is appropriate for this 1:1 aspect ratio requirement.
