review:
  strengths:
  - Creative simulation of tile-based map background using geom_rect with terrain
    classification
  - Excellent layered composition using grammar of graphics (tiles → coastline → points
    → labels)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct category colors
  - Good use of size encoding for visitor counts with appropriate legend
  - Realistic San Francisco landmarks data with plausible coordinates and visitor
    estimates
  - Clean attribution text for simulated tiles as required by spec
  weaknesses:
  - Title is truncated on the left edge (shows "arks" instead of full title)
  - Label overlap between "Fishermans Wharf" and "Pier 39" despite nudge adjustments
  - Legend positioned far from the map with excessive whitespace on right side
  image_description: 'The plot displays a map of San Francisco with tile-style background
    showing simulated land (beige) and water (light blue) areas. A coastline polygon
    outlines the San Francisco peninsula in dark gray. Data points represent 15 landmarks
    with varying sizes based on visitor counts (ranging from 500 to 15,000 thousand/year)
    and colors indicating 8 categories (Cultural, Historic, Landmark, Museum, Shopping,
    Sports, Tourism, Transport). Four labels identify top attractions: Golden Gate
    Bridge, Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39, and Union Square. The title appears truncated
    on the left side (showing "arks · map-tile-background · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    instead of the full title). Two legends appear on the right: a size legend showing
    visitor counts (5000, 10000, 15000 K/yr) and a category color legend. Axis labels
    show Longitude (°) and Latitude (°) with appropriate coordinate values for the
    Bay Area.'
