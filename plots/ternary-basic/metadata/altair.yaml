review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent ternary plot implementation with proper coordinate transformation from
    ternary to Cartesian
  - Clean grid lines at 20% intervals with subtle dashed styling (alpha 0.3)
  - Clear vertex labels with component names and percentages
  - Good use of tooltips for interactive data exploration
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic soil composition scenario with appropriate data context
  - Well-implemented tick marks along all three edges
  weaknesses:
  - Tick labels on left and right edges could be slightly larger for better readability
    at smaller display sizes
