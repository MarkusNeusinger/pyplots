review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Iris-like data providing a realistic, scientifically meaningful
    context
  - Clean three-cluster separation clearly demonstrates categorical grouping
  - Good color palette (Python colors) that is colorblind-safe
  - Proper use of pygal custom Style with appropriately scaled font sizes for 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Alpha transparency (0.7) allows visibility of any overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-left overlaps with the plot area grid region; consider
    legend_at_bottom=True or repositioning
  - Marker stroke_width=0 removes outlines which could help distinguish overlapping
    points
