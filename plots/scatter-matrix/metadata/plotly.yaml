review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the scatter plot matrix with histograms on diagonal
    and scatter plots off-diagonal
  - Proper use of color encoding to distinguish three species with legend grouping
  - Axis labels include units (cm) and are placed correctly on matrix edges
  - Good data generation mimicking real Iris dataset with species-specific distributions
  - Correct title format and square image format appropriate for matrix visualization
  - Clean, readable code structure with appropriate transparency and marker sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use plotly.express scatter_matrix or px.splom which would be more idiomatic
    for this visualization type
  - Yellow color for Versicolor may have accessibility issues for some colorblind
    users
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the top-right scatter cell data area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) visualizing
    Iris-like flower measurement data. The diagonal contains overlapping histograms
    showing distributions for each of the four variables (Sepal Length, Sepal Width,
    Petal Length, Petal Width - all in cm units). Off-diagonal cells contain scatter
    plots showing pairwise relationships. Three species are color-coded: Setosa (blue,
    #306998), Versicolor (yellow, #FFD43B), and Virginica (red/coral, #E74C3C). The
    legend is positioned in the upper-right corner with a "Species" title. The title
    "scatter-matrix · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. A white/clean
    template is used with subtle grid lines. Variable names appear as axis labels
    on the left (y-axis) and bottom (x-axis) edges of the matrix.'
