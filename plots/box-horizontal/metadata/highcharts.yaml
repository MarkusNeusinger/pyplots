review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario using API response times by service type
  - Proper use of Highcharts inverted chart for horizontal orientation
  - Good color scheme with Python blue boxes and yellow median lines for contrast
  - Well-sized text elements readable at full resolution
  - Correct whisker calculation using 1.5*IQR methodology
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Data does not include explicit outlier points which would better demonstrate box
    plot capabilities
  - Vertical spacing between box plots could be tighter to reduce whitespace
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing "Response Time
    Distribution by Service Type". The title "box-horizontal · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text, with a gray subtitle below. Five service
    categories are shown on the y-axis: API Gateway, Database Query, File Upload,
    Authentication, and Payment Processing. The x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)"
    ranging from 0 to 490. Each box plot is rendered with a blue fill color (Python
    blue #306998) with transparency, blue outlines for boxes and whiskers, and yellow/gold
    median lines. The boxes show different distributions - Authentication has the
    smallest/fastest times, while File Upload has the largest spread extending to
    ~490ms. A subtle gray grid helps with value reading. The layout is clean with
    good spacing between elements.'
