review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent Gapminder-style visualization with all key elements: play/pause controls,
    timeline slider, year watermark'
  - Clean code structure with realistic simulated country data showing growth over
    20 years
  - Proper use of Plotly animation features including smooth transitions (cubic-in-out
    easing)
  - Good accessibility with distinct colors and proper font sizing throughout
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Some bubble overlap in the lower-left cluster makes individual countries harder
    to distinguish in year 2000
  - Legend positioned inside the plot area could potentially overlap with data points
    in some frames
  - Year watermark annotation shows static 2000 and does not update with animation
    frames
