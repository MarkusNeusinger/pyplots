review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (Q for
    quantitative, N for nominal)
  - Clean visual hierarchy with well-chosen color palette (Python Blue as primary)
  - Good use of layering (bars + average line + annotation text)
  - Interactive tooltips enhance usability
  - Proper canvas sizing (1600x900 with scale_factor=3.0) following library guidelines
  - Creative solution using mark_rect with y/y2 encoding to create horizontal bars
  - Cluster averages clearly communicated both in legend and via annotation
  weaknesses:
  - The Avg annotation text position (y=5) places it at the bottom of the chart rather
    than at a more prominent position
  - No interactive selection or highlighting when hovering over clusters (missed Altair
    strength)
  - Bars extending from 0 to silhouette value using x2=alt.value(0) could be clearer
  image_description: 'The plot displays a silhouette plot for K-means clustering of
    the Iris dataset with 3 clusters. The visualization uses horizontal bars where
    each bar represents a sample''s silhouette coefficient. The three clusters are
    shown in distinct colors: blue (Cluster 0, avg: 0.42), yellow (Cluster 1, avg:
    0.80), and red (Cluster 2, avg: 0.45). The clusters are stacked vertically with
    clear visual separation. A dashed red vertical line marks the overall average
    silhouette score (0.553) with an annotation "Avg: 0.553". The x-axis shows "Silhouette
    Coefficient" ranging from approximately -0.20 to 1.00. The title reads "silhouette-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top. The legend is positioned in the upper right
    corner showing cluster labels with their average scores.'
