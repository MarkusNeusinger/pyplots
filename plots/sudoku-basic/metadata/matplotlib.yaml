review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear thick/thin line distinction for 3×3 boxes
    vs individual cells
  - Clean monochrome design perfectly suited for printing as specified
  - Numbers are large, bold, and perfectly centered in cells
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Uses a valid, realistic Sudoku puzzle configuration
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate zorder layering
  weaknesses:
  - Could use a slightly larger canvas margin at the bottom to perfectly balance the
    title padding at top
  - No use of advanced matplotlib features like style contexts or rcParams
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clean, well-structured 9×9 Sudoku grid in
    a square format. The grid uses a crisp black-and-white monochrome design with
    clear visual hierarchy: thick black lines (approximately 5px) separate the nine
    3×3 boxes, while thinner lines (approximately 1.5px) divide individual cells within
    each box. Numbers 1-9 are displayed in large, bold black font centered within
    their cells. Empty cells are left blank (zeros not displayed). The title "sudoku-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. The grid fills
    the canvas well with balanced white margins around all sides. The overall appearance
    is clean, professional, and optimized for printing.'
