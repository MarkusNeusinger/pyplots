review:
  strengths:
  - Clean minimal design appropriate for sparkline concept with no axes or gridlines
  - Uses pygal Style class for comprehensive visual customization
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Area fill under line provides good visual weight
  - Cubic interpolation creates smooth line appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Min/max point highlighting not rendering correctly - red minimum dot not visible
    in output
  - Unintended legend label appearing in bottom-left despite passing None as series
    label
  - Aspect ratio is standard 16:9 instead of compact sparkline ratio (4:1 to 8:1)
  - Visual output suggests predominantly upward trend, not reflecting balanced variation
    in data
