review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing four distinct distribution shapes (normal, bimodal,
    right-skewed, left-skewed) that perfectly demonstrate the value of violin plots
  - Clean use of seaborn inner=box parameter for embedded box plots
  - Modern API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Professional color palette with good contrast and accessibility
  - Appropriate font sizes and clear labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only on y-axis, though acceptable for categorical x-axis
  - Legend disabled which is fine since batch names are on x-axis, but a small legend
    could enhance standalone viewing
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots with embedded box plots
    comparing Quality Scores (0-100) across four manufacturing batches (A, B, C, D).
    Each violin uses a distinct color: Batch A in steel blue (#306998), Batch B in
    yellow (#FFD43B), Batch C in teal (#4A90A4), and Batch D in orange (#E8A838).
    The violin shapes clearly show different distribution characteristics: Batch A
    shows a symmetric normal distribution centered around 75, Batch B exhibits a bimodal
    distribution with two peaks (around 60 and 80), Batch C shows a right-skewed distribution
    with concentration at lower values, and Batch D displays a left-skewed distribution
    concentrated at higher values. Each violin contains a visible black box plot with
    white median markers, quartile boxes, and whiskers. The title "violin-box · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently at the top. X-axis is labeled "Manufacturing
    Batch" and Y-axis shows "Quality Score (0-100)" with a subtle dashed grid on the
    y-axis.'
