review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_pie with hole parameter for donut effect
  - Center annotation with total budget provides useful summary statistic as spec
    requested
  - Clean percentage labels with proper formatting using layer_labels
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Proper category ordering preserved using pd.Categorical
  weaknesses:
  - Donut chart appears small relative to the large canvas; could use more of the
    available space
