review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highmaps TopoJSON topology for Europe map
  - Clean sequential blue color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Good data labels showing country names directly on the map
  - Proper handling of missing data with gray coloring (nullColor)
  - Well-implemented vertical color legend with title and scale
  - Realistic population density data for European countries
  - Both interactive HTML and static PNG outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Some small country labels may be difficult to read (e.g., Monaco, Andorra, Luxembourg)
  - Legend could have more refined styling/spacing
  - Could benefit from hover tooltips being more prominent in static image context
