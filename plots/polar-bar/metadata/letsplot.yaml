review:
  strengths:
  - Correct polar bar/wind rose implementation using coord_polar
  - Good color differentiation across 8 compass directions
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate use of lets-plot grammar of graphics features (geom_bar + coord_polar)
  - Well-formatted title following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label shows Frequency (%) but data appears to be absolute counts not percentages
  - Direction labels (NE, SE) positioned outside the plot area - could be more integrated
  - Consider adding radial gridlines for easier magnitude reading
