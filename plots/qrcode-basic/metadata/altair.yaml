review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of QR code structure with proper finder patterns in three
    corners
  - Clean, high-contrast black and white color scheme per spec requirements
  - Proper quiet zone (4 modules) surrounding the QR code for reliable scanning
  - Deterministic data pattern generation from content hash ensures reproducibility
  - Appropriate use of Altair mark_rect for grid-based visualization
  - Title follows exact required format
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Could add tooltips showing module position or data region type for interactivity
  - The HTML version could benefit from .interactive() for zoom/pan capability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a QR code visualization with the title "qrcode-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top in black text. The QR code itself is rendered
    as a grid of black and white square modules using Altair''s mark_rect. Three finder
    patterns (the characteristic large square-in-square patterns) are visible in three
    corners: top-left, top-right, and bottom-left. The data area contains a deterministic
    pattern of black and white modules. A quiet zone (white border) surrounds the
    QR code. The overall layout is square format with good proportions, and the high
    contrast black-on-white design ensures maximum readability.'
