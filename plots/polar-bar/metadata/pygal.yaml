review:
  strengths:
  - Clean blue color gradient provides excellent visual hierarchy and is colorblind-safe
  - Stacked wind speed categories effectively show distribution patterns
  - Dominant W/NW wind pattern is clearly visible, demonstrating realistic meteorological
    data
  - Good use of legend placement at bottom with horizontal columns
  - Custom style properly configured for large canvas size
  weaknesses:
  - Title missing the descriptive portion - should be "Polar Bar Chart (Wind Rose)
    · polar-bar · pygal · pyplots.ai"
  - Radar chart with filled polygons is a valid wind rose representation, but traditional
    polar bars would have discrete wedge-shaped bars rather than connected polygon
    fills
  - The x_title Wind Frequency (%) is set in code but not prominently displayed in
    output
