review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram using XY chart with carefully constructed
    step coordinates
  - Clean, readable code with proper KISS structure and reproducible seed
  - Bimodal distribution data effectively showcases the plot type ability to reveal
    distribution shapes
  - Proper title format and clear axis labels
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Value (units) or Frequency (count))
  - Could use more realistic/contextual data scenario instead of abstract values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a step histogram showing a bimodal distribution
    on a white background. A blue step line (Python blue #306998) outlines the histogram
    without any fill, creating a clean step-function appearance. The title "histogram-stepwise
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark gray text. The X-axis is labeled
    "Value" (ranging approximately 20-110) and the Y-axis is labeled "Frequency" (ranging
    0-38). The bimodal distribution shows two distinct peaks: one centered around
    value 50 with frequency ~38, and another around value 85 with frequency ~27. Horizontal
    grid lines are visible at regular intervals. The step lines correctly connect
    horizontal segments (bin counts) with vertical segments between adjacent bins.'

        comment: Good use of pygal.XY with show_dots=False and fill=False to create
          step effect; custom Style for sizing; however, pygal has a native Histogram
          chart type that wasn't used
  verdict: APPROVED
