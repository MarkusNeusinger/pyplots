review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn modern API with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clear visual differentiation between manufacturing lines with distinct colors
  - Data demonstrates variety in distributions (tight clustering in Line C vs wide
    spread in Line D)
  - Professional title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  - Good use of jitter (0.25) to show individual points without excessive spread
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (Quality Score could specify scale like 0-100)
  - Two yellow shades (Line B, Line E) are somewhat similar - could use more distinct
    palette like colorblind
  - Does not showcase advanced seaborn features like overlaying with boxplot or using
    built-in palettes
  - Some data points exceed 100 which is unusual for a score metric
