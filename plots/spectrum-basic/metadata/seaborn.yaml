review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color contrast
  - Realistic machinery vibration scenario with fundamental frequency and harmonics
  - Effective use of fill_between to enhance the spectrum visualization
  - Peak frequency highlighting with vertical dashed lines aids interpretation
  - Proper use of dB scale as recommended in the specification
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Uses seaborn primarily for lineplot which is relatively basic; could leverage
    more distinctive seaborn features
  - Grid styling uses alpha=0.3 which is acceptable but slightly at the edge of the
    0.2-0.4 recommendation
