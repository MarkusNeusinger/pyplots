review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all forest plot requirements: diamond pooled estimate,
    weighted markers, reference line, CI whiskers'
  - Clear, professional layout with study labels and effect sizes displayed in readable
    format
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot for weighted point estimates with size mapping
  - Proper directional annotations help interpret the plot
  - Realistic meta-analysis data with chronological study names and varied effect
    sizes
  weaknesses:
  - sns.set_style called after plt.subplots (should be called before for idiomatic
    seaborn usage)
  - Layout could be slightly tighter on the right side to reduce whitespace
  image_description: The forest plot displays a meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies
    showing treatment effect (mean difference) with horizontal confidence intervals.
    The plot uses a blue color scheme (#306998) for study markers and CI lines. Each
    study is represented with a circular marker whose size varies proportionally to
    study weight. Study names are listed on the left (e.g., "Johnson et al. 2019",
    "Brown et al. 2020"), while effect sizes with 95% CIs are shown on the right in
    monospace font (e.g., "-0.52 [-0.77, -0.27]"). A dashed vertical reference line
    at x=0 indicates the null effect. At the bottom, a yellow diamond shows the pooled
    estimate (-0.31 [-0.37, -0.24]). The title "forest-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top. Directional annotations "← Favors Treatment"
    and "Favors Control →" appear at the top of the plot area.
