review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required features (ECDFs, K-S statistic, max divergence
    highlight, p-value, legend) present and working'
  - Strong data storytelling with interpretive subtitle, prominent D label, and shaded
    divergence region guiding the viewer
  - Publication-quality typography with all font sizes explicitly configured for the
    4800x2700 target
  - Realistic credit scoring context directly from the spec application examples
  - Clean, idiomatic plotnine code using grammar of graphics layer composition
  weaknesses:
  - Some wasted horizontal space on the right side from excessive x-axis padding (x_pad
    * 3)
  - The shaded rectangle for max divergence is slightly crude — a narrower highlight
    or just the dashed line might look more refined
  - Separate annotation DataFrames (df_shade, df_seg) add verbosity, though necessary
    for plotnine grammar
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step functions on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. "Good
    Customers" is drawn in dark blue (#306998) and "Bad Customers" in orange (#E8873D).
    The x-axis shows "Credit Score (points)" ranging from approximately 200 to 1000,
    and the y-axis shows "Cumulative Proportion (0–1)" from 0.0 to 1.0. A bold dashed
    dark red vertical line at approximately x=620 marks the point of maximum divergence
    between the two distributions, with a translucent pink shaded rectangle highlighting
    the divergence region. The label "D = 0.730" appears in bold red to the right
    of the divergence line. A statistics box near the bottom reads "K-S Statistic
    = 0.730 | p-value = 9.54e-78" in red on a light pink background. The title "ks-test-comparison
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold 24pt text. An italic subtitle
    below reads "Distributions are highly distinct (D > 0.5) — strong evidence the
    groups differ". The legend is positioned in the upper-left area with a white background
    and thin gray border, listing both distributions.
