review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stepped line style for precision-recall curve using
    ax.step()
  - 'Complete feature coverage: AP score, baseline reference line, iso-F1 curves all
    present'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Professional visualization with appropriate colors and styling
  - Realistic imbalanced dataset simulation (20/80 split)
  - Good use of beta distributions to simulate realistic classifier scores
  weaknesses:
  - F1 curve labels are relatively small (fontsize=12) and low contrast (gray, alpha=0.7)
    - could be more prominent
  - Only shows single classifier; spec mentions multiple classifiers comparison as
    an option
  - Header claims matplotlib 3.10.0 but version is hardcoded without verification
