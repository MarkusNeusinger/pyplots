review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Scatterpolar for radar charts with proper fill and line
    styling
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles with no unnecessary complexity
  - Realistic employee performance context that matches spec applications perfectly
  - Proper polygon closure by repeating first value
  - Good font sizing throughout (28pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Single series only; adding a second comparison series would better showcase radar
    chart utility
  - Data values are clustered (72-92); wider spread would demonstrate the chart ability
    to show strengths and weaknesses more dramatically
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - radar chart has generous margins
  image_description: 'The radar chart displays employee performance across 6 competencies:
    Technical Skills (highest, ~92), Communication (~85), Creativity (~80), Leadership
    (~72), Problem Solving (~88), and Teamwork (~78). The polygon is filled with a
    translucent light blue (rgba 48,105,152 @ 0.25 alpha) and outlined with a darker
    blue (#306998) line with markers at each vertex. The title "radar-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend labeled "Performance Score" appears
    in the upper right. Radial gridlines are visible at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 intervals.
    All axis labels are clearly readable around the perimeter.'

        comment: Radar charts don't have traditional X/Y axis labels; category labels
          are descriptive but no units (performance scores are unitless, acceptable
          for this context)

        comment: Shows single series with variation across competencies; spec mentions
