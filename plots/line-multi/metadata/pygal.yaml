review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with four distinct trend patterns (steady growth,
    gradual growth, seasonal variation)
  - Clean, professional color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-configured font sizes and margins for the large canvas
  - Good use of dots to highlight individual data points
  - Descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-left could be closer to the data area or at bottom
  - Data is deterministic but CQ-02 scoring convention expects explicit seed comment
    for clarity
