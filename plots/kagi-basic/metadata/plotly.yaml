review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Correct Kagi chart algorithm implementation with proper reversal logic
  - Proper yang/yin determination based on breaking previous highs/lows
  - Good use of Plotly layout customization for professional appearance
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - The generated data results in almost entirely bearish (yin/red) segments with
    minimal bullish (yang/green) representation - the chart should demonstrate both
    trend types more evenly
  - Red/green color scheme is not colorblind-accessible; consider using blue/orange
    or other distinguishable colors
  - Legend is positioned inside the chart area which could overlap with data in some
    cases
  - The line thickness difference between yang (width=6) and yin (width=2) could be
    more pronounced for clearer visual distinction
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart showing price movements over approximately
    13 line indices. The chart starts with a thick green (yang/bullish) vertical line
    on the left side dropping from around $110 down to approximately $82. After this
    initial drop, the entire remainder of the chart consists of thin red (yin/bearish)
    lines forming a stair-step pattern with both vertical and horizontal segments.
    The price oscillates between roughly $82 and $108 with multiple reversals. The
    title "kagi-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The X-axis shows
    "Line Index" (0-12) and Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately 85-110.
    A legend in the upper left shows "Yang (Bullish)" with a thick green line and
    "Yin (Bearish)" with a thin red line. The background is white with subtle gray
    gridlines.
