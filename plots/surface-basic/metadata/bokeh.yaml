review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent creative solution: Bokeh lacks native 3D support, but the implementation
    cleverly uses patches with painters algorithm for depth-sorted 3D surface rendering'
  - Proper use of Viridis256 colormap and LinearColorMapper for color encoding
  - Clean isometric projection with configurable elevation and azimuth angles
  - Subtle edge styling enhances 3D perception without being distracting
  - Colorbar correctly shows Z value scale
  - Good canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with appropriate font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X, Y, Z) without descriptive context or units
  - Colorbar title Z Value is truncated/rotated, could be improved
  - The HTML output is also generated which may not be necessary for static review
