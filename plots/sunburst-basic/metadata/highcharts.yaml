review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple) with brightness
    variation for hierarchy levels
  - Well-structured hierarchical data representing realistic corporate budget breakdown
  - Proper title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Good use of Highcharts sunburst module with level-specific styling
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring labels are difficult to read due to rotation and small segment
    sizes
  - Could benefit from larger font sizes on outer ring labels for better legibility
    at full resolution
  - Data could show more variation in segment sizes to better demonstrate proportional
    representation
