review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic service response time distributions showing
    varied spreads and outliers
  - Services sorted by median for easier comparison as recommended in specification
  - Clean alternating color scheme using Python brand colors (blue/yellow)
  - Proper use of plotly.graph_objects for horizontal box plots
  - Good margin management (l=180) to accommodate longer service names
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs appropriate for plotly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity at 0.1 is quite subtle; could be increased to 0.2-0.3 for better
    readability
  - Could add hover template customization to show more statistics on hover (plotly
    strength)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response times
    (in milliseconds) for 6 different service types. The services are arranged vertically
    on the y-axis (Cache Lookup, Authentication, Message Queue, API Gateway, Database
    Query, File Storage) sorted by median response time from fastest to slowest. The
    x-axis shows Response Time (ms) ranging from 0 to 500. Boxes alternate between
    Python blue (#306998) and Python yellow (#FFD43B) colors. Each box shows the quartile
    distribution with whiskers extending to show data range, and outlier points are
    visible for most services. The title "box-horizontal · plotly · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top. The background is clean white with subtle gridlines.
