review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code structure with good comments explaining the data scenario
  - Clever workaround using discrete bins to simulate continuous color mapping (pygal
    does not natively support continuous colormaps)
  - Viridis-inspired colorblind-safe palette correctly implemented
  - Realistic temperature sensor grid scenario with appropriate values
  - Proper font sizing for the large canvas (4800x2700)
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - The spec explicitly requires a colorbar that provides a reference scale - the
    discrete legend bins do not function as a true colorbar showing continuous values
  - Legend should include the variable name Temperature as a title to clarify what
    the colors represent
  - Dot size could be slightly larger (dots_size=15-18) for better visibility at this
    data density
