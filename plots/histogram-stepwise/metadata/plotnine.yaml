review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram using geom_step with manually computed
    bin edges
  - Perfect demonstration of overlaying multiple distributions for comparison (key
    application from spec)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper figure sizing (16x9) and text scaling for 4800x2700 output
  - Good color contrast between the two distributions
  - Realistic and neutral data scenario (server performance comparison)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement inside the plot area could potentially overlap with data in some
    cases; consider placing outside
  - Manual histogram computation instead of exploring plotnine native histogram capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays two overlapping step histograms showing response
    time distributions for server configurations. The blue line represents "Optimized
    Setup" (centered around 180ms with a tighter distribution) and the yellow/gold
    line represents "Standard Setup" (centered around 250ms with a wider spread).
    The plot uses a clean white background with subtle gray grid lines. The title
    "histogram-stepwise · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top.
    X-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from about 50 to 500, Y-axis shows "Frequency"
    ranging from 0 to 60. A legend in the right portion of the plot area identifies
    the two configurations. The step lines are thick and clearly visible with good
    contrast.

        comment: Grid is appropriately subtle. However, the legend placement inside
          the plot area is acceptable but could be positioned better to avoid potential
          overlap with data

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_step, theme_minimal, and proper theming.
          However, manually computing histogram bins rather than using geom_histogram
          with stat approach is a workaround rather than leveraging plotnine's native
          capabilities
  verdict: APPROVED
