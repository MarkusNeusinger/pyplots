review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's Band glyph for the volatility envelope
  - Good interactive features with HoverTool showing all data points
  - Clean separation of price line, SMA, and bands with appropriate visual hierarchy
  - Proper datetime x-axis handling
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement on the right side creates visual disconnect from the plot area
  - Yellow SMA line could have better contrast against the light background
  image_description: The plot displays a Bollinger Bands chart for stock price data
    spanning from February 2024 to June 2024. The chart features a dark navy/black
    price line (Close Price) that moves within a semi-transparent blue band (the Bollinger
    Bands envelope). The middle band (20-period SMA) is shown as a dashed yellow/gold
    line. The upper and lower bands are rendered with solid blue lines, and the area
    between them is filled with a light blue semi-transparent color. The title "indicator-bollinger
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from approximately 85 to 110, and the x-axis shows "Date" with monthly labels.
    A legend is positioned on the right side showing "Close Price", "SMA (20)", and
    "Upper/Lower Band (±2σ)". The background is a light gray (#fafafa), and the grid
    lines are subtle dashed lines.
