review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and colorblind-safe color scheme
  - Perfect implementation of the pyramid chart concept with negative values for left-extending
    bars
  - Smart use of labelExpr to display absolute values on the x-axis while using signed
    values internally
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code with proper encoding types (N for nominal, Q for
    quantitative)
  - Informative tooltips showing gender, age group, and absolute population values
  - Proper age group ordering (youngest at bottom, traditional pyramid orientation)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-right corner could be placed closer to the chart or integrated
    differently
  - Could leverage Altair interactive selection features for highlighting individual
    bars or genders
  - Data shows limited demographic variation - more pronounced asymmetry in older
    age groups would better demonstrate the visualization purpose
