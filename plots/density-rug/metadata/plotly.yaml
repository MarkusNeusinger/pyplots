review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data demonstrates KDE behavior effectively
  - Proper use of semi-transparent fill that does not obscure rug marks
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good hover templates for interactivity (Plotly strength)
  - Rug marks implemented creatively using line-ns marker symbol
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position overlaps with the data region (upper right corner); moving it
    outside or to a less intrusive position would improve clarity
  - Could use Plotly Express distplot or violin with rug for more idiomatic Plotly
    usage
  image_description: The plot displays a density plot with rug marks showing web application
    response times. The KDE curve is rendered as a smooth blue line (#306998) with
    semi-transparent fill (approximately 35% opacity) underneath. The distribution
    is clearly bimodal with a larger peak around 120ms (fast responses) and a smaller
    peak around 250ms (slower responses). Below the density curve, along the x-axis
    at y≈0, blue vertical tick marks (rug marks) indicate the location of each individual
    data point - they are clearly denser in the two modal regions. The title "density-rug
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray. The x-axis is labeled
    "Response Time (ms)" and the y-axis is labeled "Density". A legend in the upper
    right shows "Density" (line) and "Observations" (tick mark). The background is
    clean white with subtle gray gridlines.
