review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using pygal chart composition with PIL to achieve the marginal
    plot layout
  - Consistent color scheme and styling across all three chart components
  - Proper use of HorizontalBar with reversed data order to match Y-axis orientation
  - Good use of pygal Style customization for cohesive appearance
  - Clean title implementation with proper format
  weaknesses:
  - Top marginal Y-axis tick labels (0-26) are densely packed and harder to read
  - Marginal histograms are not pixel-perfectly aligned with the scatter plot axes
    (X bins do not exactly correspond to scatter X range)
  - Empty corner space (top-right) could be filled or the layout optimized
  - Code relies heavily on PIL for composition rather than native pygal features
