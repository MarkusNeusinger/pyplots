review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highmaps TopoJSON topology for Europe map
  - Clean sequential blue color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Good data labels showing country names directly on the map
  - Proper handling of missing data with gray coloring (nullColor)
  - Well-implemented vertical color legend with title and scale
  - Realistic population density data for European countries
  - Both interactive HTML and static PNG outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Some small country labels may be difficult to read (e.g., Monaco, Andorra, Luxembourg)
  - Legend could have more refined styling/spacing
  - Could benefit from hover tooltips being more prominent in static image context
  image_description: The plot shows a choropleth map of Europe displaying population
    density (people per km²). The title "choropleth-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle "Population Density (people
    per km²)" below. Countries are colored using a sequential blue color palette ranging
    from very light blue (low density ~0) to dark navy blue (high density ~550). The
    Netherlands appears darkest blue (highest density), followed by Belgium and UK.
    Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) appear lightest indicating low
    density. A vertical color legend on the right side shows the density scale from
    0-550 per km². Country names are labeled directly on the map. Countries without
    data appear in light gray. The map is well-proportioned and fills the canvas appropriately.

        comment: Good use of Highmaps for geographic visualization, TopoJSON integration,
          custom color stops, data labels, and hover states. Could use more advanced
          features like drilldown.
