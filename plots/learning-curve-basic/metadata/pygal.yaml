review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of learning curve with appropriate training vs validation
    gap
  - Confidence bands shown as dashed lines effectively communicate uncertainty
  - Custom style properly scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue and gold)
  - Proper KISS code structure with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears slightly clipped/truncated, reducing readability
  - Lower portion of the plot (y < 0.7) is mostly empty white space
  - Does not fully leverage pygal interactive SVG features (tooltips, hover effects)
  image_description: The plot displays a learning curve with two main lines on a white
    background. The **blue line** represents the "Training Score (±1σ band)" staying
    consistently high around 0.93-0.95 across all training set sizes. The **yellow/gold
    line** represents the "Validation Score (±1σ band)" starting lower at ~0.71 for
    100 samples and improving to ~0.87 at 1000 samples. Both curves have dashed confidence
    bands (±1 standard deviation) shown as thinner dashed lines. The X-axis shows
    "Training Set Size (samples)" from 100 to 1000. The Y-axis shows "Accuracy Score"
    from 0.5 to 1.0. The title correctly follows the format "learning-curve-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". Legend is placed at the bottom with two columns. Dot markers
    are visible on the main curves. The gap between training and validation curves
    clearly demonstrates the variance/overfitting pattern typical of learning curves.

        comment: uses pygal XY chart, custom Style, stroke_style for line width, dashed
          lines for confidence bands. Does not leverage interactive tooltips or SVG-specific
          features more fully.
  verdict: APPROVED
