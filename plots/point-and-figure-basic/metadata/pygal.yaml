review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe blue/orange palette is excellent
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear P&F algorithm
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate box size
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing and grid
  weaknesses:
  - Support and resistance trend lines do not appear in rendered output despite being
    added to chart
  - Uses circular dot markers instead of actual X and O symbols (pygal limitation)
  - Plot could better utilize canvas space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Point and Figure chart with 8 columns of
    price reversals. The chart uses green circular markers for rising (X) columns
    and red/orange circular markers for falling (O) columns. The Y-axis shows "Price
    ($)" ranging from 82 to 110 in $2 increments (box size). The X-axis shows "Column
    (Reversal)" from 0 to 7. Subtle horizontal dashed grid lines are visible. The
    legend at the bottom shows "X (Rising)" in green and "O (Falling)" in red. The
    title correctly displays "point-and-figure-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai". The chart
    shows a clear pattern: starting with a bullish rise (column 0), followed by bearish
    reversal (column 1), then alternating bullish and bearish columns. Support and
    resistance trend lines mentioned in the code are NOT visible in the rendered output.'
