review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of pyramid chart using Highcharts bar chart with negative
    values for left side
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette using Python official colors
  - Proper symmetric axis scaling with calculated max value
  - Good use of custom JavaScript formatters for tooltips and data labels showing
    absolute values
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Realistic demographic data context
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend appears to be positioned outside the visible screenshot area (y: -50 may
    push it off-screen)'
  - The mirrored Y-axis on the right side is redundant and adds visual clutter
  - Could use Highcharts-specific annotations or interactive features more extensively
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart (population pyramid)
    showing population distribution by age group. Blue bars (#306998, Python Blue)
    represent Male population extending leftward from the central axis, while yellow
    bars (#FFD43B, Python Yellow) represent Female population extending rightward.
    Age groups range from "0-9" at the bottom to "80+" at the top, with labels on
    both left and right Y-axes. Each bar displays its absolute value as a data label.
    The title "Population by Age Group · pyramid-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top, with a subtitle explaining "Male (left) vs
    Female (right) - Population in Millions". The chart has a clean white background
    with subtle grid lines and a dark vertical line at the center (value 0).
