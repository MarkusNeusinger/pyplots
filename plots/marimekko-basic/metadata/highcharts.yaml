review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts variwide chart type for the Marimekko visualization
  - Clean implementation with proper variable-width bars representing market sizes
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette
  - Data labels on segments improve readability
  - Region names properly centered under each bar using custom renderer
  - Realistic market share data with meaningful variation between regions
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines not visible on the plot area (gridLineWidth set but not appearing prominently)
  - Y-axis tick labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800x2700
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Marimekko chart showing market share distribution
    across 5 regions (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East).
    Each region has a variable-width bar proportional to its market size in millions
    USD. The bars are stacked with 4 product categories: Enterprise (dark blue #306998),
    SMB (yellow #FFD43B), Consumer (purple #9467BD), and Government (cyan #17BECF).
    Percentage labels appear on each segment (e.g., 42%, 28%, 22%, 8% for North America).
    The title "marimekko-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at top with a subtitle.
    The legend is positioned on the right side. Region names appear below each bar,
    and the x-axis shows cumulative market size values.'
