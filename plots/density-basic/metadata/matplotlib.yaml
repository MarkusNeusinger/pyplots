review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density plot with smooth KDE curve and attractive
    fill
  - Rug plot adds valuable detail showing individual observations as recommended in
    spec
  - Clean, professional styling with removed spines and subtle grid
  - Bimodal test score distribution demonstrates multiple distribution characteristics
    (skewness, bimodality)
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Good color choice with appropriate alpha values for fill and rug
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include units for full marks (e.g., Test Score (points))
  - Relies on scipy.stats.gaussian_kde rather than exploring matplotlib-native density
    plotting options
