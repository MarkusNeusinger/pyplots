review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: regression line, 95% CI band,
    R² annotation, and equation'
  - Clean, publication-quality visualization with proper color scheme and contrast
  - Interactive tooltips enhance the lets-plot experience by showing individual data
    point values on hover
  - Well-positioned annotation that does not overlap with data points
  - Realistic business analytics scenario that clearly demonstrates the purpose of
    regression analysis
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling uses dashed lines which may be slightly distracting; solid subtle
    lines might be cleaner
  - Wildcard import pattern (from lets_plot import *) is necessary but not ideal
  - Points could be slightly larger (size=6-7) for optimal visibility at 100 data
    points
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with linear regression showing
    the relationship between Advertising Spend ($K) on the x-axis (ranging from 10
    to 100) and Sales Revenue ($K) on the y-axis (ranging from approximately 60 to
    320). Data points are rendered as blue circles (#306998) with moderate transparency.
    A yellow/gold regression line (#FFD43B) runs diagonally from bottom-left to top-right
    with a semi-transparent confidence band (95% CI) in matching yellow. The regression
    equation "y = 2.37x + 56.7" and "R² = 0.888" are annotated in the upper-left portion
    of the plot area. The title "scatter-regression-linear · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Grid lines are dashed and subtle gray. The overall layout
    is clean and well-proportioned.

        comment: Uses geom_smooth with method="lm", layer_tooltips for interactivity,
          ggsize for proper sizing; good use but could leverage more lets-plot specific
          theming
  verdict: APPROVED
