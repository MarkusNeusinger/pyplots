review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style calendar heatmap that perfectly matches the spec requirements
  - Well-implemented layered approach with heatmap and month text overlays
  - Good use of weekday/weekend patterns in the simulated data for realism
  - Clean sequential green colormap that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity showing date, contributions, and day
    name
  - Rounded corners (cornerRadius=3) give a polished appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the heatmap for better visual association
  - Missing dates (if any existed) would not be visually distinct from zero-value
    cells
  - Could benefit from Altair interactivity features (selection, zoom/pan)
