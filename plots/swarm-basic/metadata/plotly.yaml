review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom beeswarm algorithm that effectively spreads points to avoid overlap
    while maintaining visual clarity
  - Good use of mean diamond markers to show central tendency for each group as suggested
    in the spec
  - Thoughtful data design showing varied distribution shapes (bimodal, wide spread,
    tight clusters)
  - Clean, readable code structure with proper comments
  - Correct title format and proper output sizing (4800x2700 via scale=3)
  - Well-designed hover templates showing classroom and score
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Plotly's distinctive features like violin mode, built-in jitter,
    or advanced interactivity beyond basic hover
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Test Score (points)" or similar)
  - Legend placement has slight isolation from the main plot area
