review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_rect for span regions
  - Clean layering with spans drawn first so line appears on top
  - Realistic recession period scenario with stock price data
  - Both vertical (time-based) and horizontal (threshold-based) spans demonstrated
  - Proper figure sizing and text scaling for high-resolution output
  - Good color choices with meaningful legend
  weaknesses:
  - The horizontal Risk Zone span (60-80) does not intersect with the actual data
    (price range ~150-210), making it visually disconnected and less educational
  - Optional text labels within span regions (mentioned in spec notes) are not implemented
