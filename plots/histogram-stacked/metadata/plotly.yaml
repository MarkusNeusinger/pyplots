review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and balanced layout
  - Proper implementation of stacked histogram using consistent bin edges across all
    groups
  - Realistic manufacturing QC scenario with meaningful overlapping distributions
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Uses manual histogram calculation with go.Bar instead of more idiomatic Plotly
    histogram traces
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive features like custom hover templates
