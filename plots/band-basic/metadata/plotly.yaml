review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing throughout
  - Correct implementation of the toself fill technique for creating the band
  - Heteroscedastic uncertainty band effectively demonstrates growing confidence intervals
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-balanced layout
  - Proper use of semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.3) allowing visibility of overlapping
    elements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (s)" or "Value (units)")
  - Does not leverage Plotly's distinctive interactive features like custom hover
    templates showing the exact confidence bounds
  image_description: The plot displays a band chart with a light blue semi-transparent
    filled region representing a 95% confidence interval, and a darker blue solid
    trend line running through the center. The band starts narrow on the left (around
    x=0) and progressively widens toward the right (x=10), illustrating heteroscedasticity
    (uncertainty growing over time). The title "band-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top in a large font. The x-axis is labeled "Time" (ranging
    0-10), and the y-axis is labeled "Value" (ranging ~1-10). A legend in the upper-left
    corner identifies both the "95% Confidence Interval" (band) and "Trend Line".
    The background is clean white with subtle gray grid lines. The overall layout
    is well-balanced with good use of the 16:9 aspect ratio.

        comment: Uses basic go.Scatter with fill="toself" technique, which is standard
          Plotly but doesn't leverage distinctive features like hover templates, rangeslider,
          or animations
  verdict: APPROVED
