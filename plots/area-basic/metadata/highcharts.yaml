review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of gradient fill using Highcharts native linearGradient
    with stops, creating an attractive visual effect that fades from top to bottom
  - Data generation is well-crafted with realistic weekly patterns (sinusoidal) plus
    growth trend plus noise, producing a visually interesting and plausible dataset
  - 'All spec requirements are met: semi-transparent fill, gridlines, clear axis labels
    with units, and gradient fill'
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas — all text elements are
    clearly readable
  - Clean, well-structured code following the Highcharts library rules exactly (container,
    inline JS, selenium export)
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could be slightly improved — the right edge of the chart area at day 30
    runs close to the canvas boundary
  - Could leverage additional Highcharts features like plotBands (to highlight weekends),
    crosshairs, or plotLines for enhanced visual interest
  - Single series only — while the spec does not require multiple series, the data
    could be enriched with a comparison month or a moving average line
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart with a steel-blue (#306998)
    line and a vertical linear gradient fill beneath it, transitioning from semi-transparent
    blue (0.5 opacity) at the top to nearly transparent (0.05 opacity) at the bottom.
    The title "area-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top, followed
    by a smaller subtitle "Daily Website Visitors Over One Month" in gray. The X-axis
    is labeled "Day of Month" showing values 1 through 30, and the Y-axis is labeled
    "Daily Visitors (count)" ranging from 1,500 to approximately 3,900. Small circular
    markers appear at each data point. A legend reading "Website Visitors" is positioned
    in the upper-right corner. The data shows a clear upward growth trend with a weekly
    cyclical pattern — dips appear around days 5-6, 12-13, and 19-20 (suggesting weekends),
    with peaks near days 8, 16-17, and 23-24. Subtle gray gridlines aid value estimation.
    The overall layout is clean with generous margins, and the chart fills the canvas
    well.

        comment: Uses Highcharts linearGradient with stops for area fill, AreaSeries,
          tooltip with headerFormat/pointFormat, subtitle, chart margin/spacing config,
          legend positioning, credits toggle. Good native usage but could leverage
          plotBands or crosshairs
  verdict: APPROVED
