review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a PDP with proper confidence intervals and rug plot
    for data distribution
  - Housing price prediction scenario is highly relatable and demonstrates real ML
    interpretability use case
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Appropriate centering of partial dependence at zero for easier interpretation
    as recommended in spec
  - Good color accessibility with blue/yellow palette
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is slightly too prominent; could be reduced to 0.2 for more
    subtle appearance
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features (e.g., seaborn statistical estimation
    capabilities or figure-level functions)
  - The partial_dependence API from sklearn is older; modern approach uses PartialDependenceDisplay
