review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular seat arrangement algorithm that properly distributes seats
    across concentric arcs
  - Clean visual design with white marker borders that distinguish individual seats
  - Proper horizontal legend with seat counts for each party
  - Smart use of Plotly hover templates for interactivity
  - Majority threshold line adds context as specified
  - Total seats annotation at center is a nice touch
  - Neutral fictional party names avoid political controversy
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - The majority threshold dashed line is quite faint (rgba 0.3 alpha); could be slightly
    more visible while remaining subtle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    420 total seats arranged in 7 concentric arcs. Seats are rendered as circular
    dots, colored by party: Progressive Alliance (blue, 145 seats) on the left, followed
    by Civic Union (yellow, 118), Green Future (green, 52), Liberty Party (purple,
    48), Reform Coalition (orange, 35), and Independent Group (pink, 22) moving toward
    the right. A dashed gray arc indicates the majority threshold (211 seats). The
    title "parliament-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in
    dark gray. The total seat count "420 seats" is displayed at the center bottom
    of the semicircle. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all parties with their
    seat counts, plus the majority threshold.'

        comment: Uses fictional neutral party names which is appropriate, but the
          political nature of parliament charts is inherently political content. However,
          using neutral names mitigates this concern adequately.

        comment: No random seed set, though data is deterministic (hardcoded). However,
          seat distribution algorithm could benefit from explicit seed for any numpy
          operations.
