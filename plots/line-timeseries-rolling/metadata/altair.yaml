review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with conditional encoding for strokeWidth
    and opacity
  - Clean data transformation using pd.melt for tidy/long format suitable for Altair
  - 'Well-chosen color scheme (#306998 blue, #FFD43B yellow) that is colorblind-safe'
  - Realistic temperature data scenario with clear seasonal trend
  - Proper use of centered rolling window (center=True) for accurate moving average
    alignment
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement overlaps slightly with data points in the upper-right corner;
    could use orient=bottom or place outside the plot area
