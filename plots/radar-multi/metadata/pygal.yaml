review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features implemented (filled polygons,
    transparency, distinct colors, legend, gridlines)
  - Clean KISS code structure following the project standards
  - Good use of custom Style with appropriate font sizes for 3600x3600 canvas
  - Realistic team skill assessment data that clearly demonstrates the comparison
    use case
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in the far corner creates visual separation from the chart; could
    be positioned closer
  - Axis labels on the left side (Technical, Leadership) are rotated/angled which
    reduces readability slightly
  - Yellow series may have reduced visibility against the white background compared
    to the blue and red series
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart with 6 axes arranged
    in a hexagonal pattern: Communication (top), Problem Solving (top-right), Teamwork
    (right), Creativity (bottom), Leadership (bottom-left), and Technical (left).
    Three teams are visualized as overlapping filled polygons with transparency: Alpha
    Team (blue, #306998), Beta Team (yellow, #FFD43B), and Gamma Team (red/pink, #E74C3C).
    The chart has a white background with gridlines at intervals of 20 from 0-100.
    Data points are marked with colored dots at each vertex. The legend is positioned
    in the top-left corner showing team names with colored squares. The title "radar-multi
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.'
