review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of animated bar race as small multiples grid for static
    output
  - Clear visual storytelling showing platform ranking evolution from 2016-2023
  - Consistent color coding maintains entity identity across all panels
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and gridplot for multi-panel layout
  - Proper axis scaling (consistent max across panels) enables fair comparison
  weaknesses:
  - No legend panel explaining color-to-platform mapping (relies on in-bar text)
  - HTML version could benefit from HoverTool for interactivity
  - Grid styling could be more subtle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples grid showing streaming
    platform subscriber counts across 4 years (2016, 2018, 2021, 2023). Each panel
    contains horizontal bars representing 6 streaming platforms (StreamMax, ViewHub,
    FlixNet, WatchNow, CineCloud, MediaFlow) sorted by subscriber count. Bars use
    distinct colors: blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), red (#DC2626), green (#059669),
    purple (#7C3AED), and orange (#EA580C). Platform names appear as white text inside
    the bars, with subscriber values (e.g., "124M", "696M") displayed to the right
    of each bar. The overall title "bar-race-animated · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top. X-axis labels show "Subscribers (millions)" on the bottom
    two panels. The visualization clearly shows ranking changes over time - for example,
    CineCloud rises from last place (28M) in 2016 to first place (696M) in 2023.'
