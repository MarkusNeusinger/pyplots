review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud on top, boxplot centered, and rain points
    below
  - Excellent bimodal distribution in Treatment B demonstrating the power of raincloud
    plots over simple boxplots
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Professional appearance with well-sized text elements
  - Creative plotnine solution using geom_ribbon for half-violins
  weaknesses:
  - No legend showing color-to-condition mapping (relies solely on y-axis labels)
  - Uses scipy for KDE instead of native plotnine density geoms (geom_violin with
    half-violin trimming would be more idiomatic)
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a horizontal raincloud visualization with three experimental conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) displayed vertically. Each condition has three components arranged from top to bottom:
    - **Cloud (half-violin/KDE)**: Blue for Control, Yellow for Treatment A, Green for Treatment B - positioned above the boxplot showing distribution density
    - **Boxplot**: White-filled narrow boxplots centered on each row showing median, quartiles, and whiskers
    - **Rain (jittered points)**: Scattered points below the boxplot in matching colors with moderate transparency

    The title "raincloud-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from ~300-600, Y-axis shows "Experimental Condition" with the three group labels. Treatment B clearly shows a bimodal distribution in both the cloud and rain points. The visual metaphor of "rain falling from clouds" is achieved correctly.

        comment: Good use of plotnine grammar (ggplot, geom_ribbon, geom_boxplot,
          geom_point, coord_flip, theme system). Creative use of geom_ribbon for half-violin.
          However, relies on scipy for KDE calculation rather than native plotnine
          density estimation.
  verdict: APPROVED
