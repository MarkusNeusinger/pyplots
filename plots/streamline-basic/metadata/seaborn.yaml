review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using seaborn lineplot with units parameter to draw individual
    streamlines
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for velocity encoding with proper colorbar
  - Clean Euler integration approach to trace streamlines from circular starting points
  - Good font sizing and text legibility throughout
  - Proper use of set_theme and set_context for consistent styling
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title header still shows Quality: pending instead of actual quality score'
  - No units on axis labels (could be X Position (m) or similar)
  - The equal aspect ratio creates unused horizontal space in 16:9 figure format
  - Some inner streamlines are very close together and slightly overlap visually
