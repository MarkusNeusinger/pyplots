review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent application of radar chart for employee performance comparison - a textbook
    use case
  - 'Perfect implementation of all spec requirements: filled polygons with alpha 0.25,
    gridlines at intervals of 20, axis labels at outer edge, distinct colors with
    legend, polygon closure'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle with deterministic data
  - Well-balanced square layout appropriate for radar charts
  - Colorblind-safe Python-themed color scheme (blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels for radar charts do not have units, which is expected but costs 2
    points in VQ-06
  - Could show more variation in data (e.g., one very low or very high score) to better
    demonstrate radar chart capabilities
  - Basic matplotlib polar features used; advanced features like custom tick formatters
    or spine styling not utilized
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/spider chart comparing two employees
    (Senior Developer in blue and Team Lead in yellow) across 6 competency dimensions:
    Technical Skills, Communication, Creativity, Leadership, Problem Solving, and
    Teamwork. The chart uses a polar coordinate system with concentric gridlines at
    20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. Each employee''s values are connected to form filled
    polygons with transparency (alpha ~0.25). The Senior Developer (blue) shows higher
    scores in Technical Skills and Problem Solving, while the Team Lead (yellow) excels
    in Teamwork and Creativity. The title follows the correct format at the top. Axis
    labels are placed at the outer edges, and a legend is positioned in the upper
    right outside the plot area.'
