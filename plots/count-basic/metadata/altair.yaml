review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear, readable text at all sizes
  - Proper use of sorted bars (descending by frequency) as recommended in spec
  - Count labels above bars enhance readability
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax for styling (cornerRadius, configure_axis)
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure
  - Appropriate color choice and grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - Pre-aggregates data manually instead of using Altair native count() aggregation
    - the implementation creates a bar chart from pre-computed values rather than
    demonstrating Altair automatic counting capability
  - Y-axis tick marks are too granular (every 2 units) creating visual clutter
