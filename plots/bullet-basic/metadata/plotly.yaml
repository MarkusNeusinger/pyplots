review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bullet chart concept using overlaid horizontal bars
    for qualitative ranges
  - Clean visual hierarchy with grayscale ranges focusing attention on the blue actual-value
    bar
  - Good use of Plotly subplot system to handle multiple metrics with independent
    scales
  - Value annotations provide precise reading as recommended in the spec
  - Target markers are clearly visible thin black lines perpendicular to the bars
  - Multiple KPIs demonstrate the comparison capability mentioned in the spec
  weaknesses:
  - Could use Plotly native go.Indicator with bullet mode for more idiomatic implementation
  - Profit chart shows 140 tick label extending into right margin area
  - Missing explicit x-axis title though subplot titles provide context
  image_description: 'The plot displays four horizontal bullet charts arranged vertically,
    each representing a different KPI metric. From top to bottom: Revenue ($K) showing
    actual value of 275 exceeding target of 250, Profit ($K) at 85 below target of
    100, Customers at 320 below target of 400, and Satisfaction at 4.2 below target
    of 4.5. Each bullet chart features three grayscale background bands representing
    qualitative ranges (poor/satisfactory/good), a blue (#306998) horizontal bar showing
    the actual value, a thin black vertical line marking the target, and the actual
    value displayed in blue text on the right side. The title "bullet-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The overall design is clean with a white
    background and subtle gridlines.'
