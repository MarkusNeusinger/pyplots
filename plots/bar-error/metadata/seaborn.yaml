review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing following the 24/20/16pt guideline for large canvas
  - Clean alternating color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of asymmetric error bars for percentage data as spec suggests
  - Good annotation explaining what error bars represent (95% CI)
  - Modern seaborn API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Y-axis correctly starts at 0 for proper bar comparison
  - Realistic A/B testing scenario with plausible conversion rate values
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars added via matplotlib errorbar() rather than exploring seaborn native
    statistical capabilities
  - The annotation box could be positioned closer to the data area rather than isolated
    in the corner
  - Feature coverage could show more variation (e.g., one notably different group
    or wider CI range)
