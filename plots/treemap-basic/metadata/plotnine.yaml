review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of treemap using plotnine primitives (geom_rect + geom_text)
    since plotnine has no native treemap geom
  - Well-implemented squarified treemap layout algorithm producing visually balanced
    rectangles
  - Clear labels with subcategory name and dollar value on each rectangle
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue and Yellow
  - Proper use of theme_void for clean treemap appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra descriptive text before the required spec-id format; should
    be "treemap-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" only
  - Labels use black text which works for lighter colors but could be harder to read
    on darker Python Blue rectangles
