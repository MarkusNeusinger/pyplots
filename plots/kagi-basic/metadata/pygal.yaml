review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements Kagi chart algorithm with yang/yin classification based on
    previous swing highs/lows
  - Uses appropriate color scheme (green for bullish, red for bearish) with redundant
    thickness encoding
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart with segment breaks using (None, None) to avoid polygon
    connections
  - Clean title format and axis labels with units
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Custom legend SVG injection does not appear in the rendered PNG output - only
    the native pygal legend is shown at the bottom
  - Excessive whitespace below the chart reduces effective canvas utilization
  - Code complexity is higher than ideal due to manual SVG manipulation
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart with the title "kagi-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The chart shows price movements from approximately $82
    to $113 over 21 Kagi line indices (0-20). Yang (bullish) segments are rendered
    in green (#16A34A) with thick lines, while Yin (bearish) segments are shown in
    red (#DC2626) with thin lines. The chart correctly shows the characteristic Kagi
    pattern with vertical price movements connected by horizontal shoulders/waists
    at reversal points. The Y-axis is labeled "Price ($)" and the X-axis is labeled
    "Kagi Line Index". A legend at the bottom shows "Yang (Bullish)" and "Yin (Bearish)"
    indicators. The plot has a white background with subtle dotted horizontal grid
    lines. The chart demonstrates clear trend reversals with approximately 21 direction
    changes, showing both uptrends and downtrends over the synthetic price data.
