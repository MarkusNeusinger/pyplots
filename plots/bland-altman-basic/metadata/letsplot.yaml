review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent annotation implementation using geom_label with color-matched text and
    white fill for high visibility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement comparison scenario with appropriate sample
    size (80 observations)
  - 'All required Bland-Altman elements present: mean bias line, ±1.96 SD limits of
    agreement, clear annotations'
  - Good use of theme_minimal with customized text sizes for publication quality
  weaknesses:
  - Point size could be slightly larger (size=6-7 instead of 5) for better visibility
    at full resolution
  - Could add tooltips for interactivity since letsplot supports it
  - Grid styling uses hardcoded color instead of leveraging theme defaults
