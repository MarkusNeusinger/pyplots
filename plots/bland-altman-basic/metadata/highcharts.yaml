review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all Bland-Altman statistical elements (mean, ±1.96
    SD limits)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate sample size (80
    pairs)
  - Good use of Highcharts plotLines feature for horizontal reference lines with labels
  - Proper transparency on markers for overlapping observation visibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (alpha 0.1) making it harder to read values at a glance
  - Does not leverage Highcharts interactive features like custom tooltips showing
    individual measurement details
  - Red color for limits of agreement could be replaced with a more colorblind-safe
    alternative
  image_description: The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement visualization with
    80 blue scatter points representing paired blood pressure observations. The x-axis
    shows "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" ranging from approximately 96 to 164, and the
    y-axis shows "Difference (Method 1 - Method 2) (mmHg)" ranging from about -25
    to 16. A solid blue horizontal line marks the mean difference at -2.67, and two
    red dashed horizontal lines indicate the ±1.96 SD limits of agreement at approximately
    +9.49 and -14.84. Each reference line is labeled with its value on the right side
    of the plot. The title "bland-altman-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top, and a legend showing "Paired Observations" is positioned in the upper
    right corner. Points have moderate transparency (alpha ~0.6) allowing overlapping
    observations to be distinguished.
