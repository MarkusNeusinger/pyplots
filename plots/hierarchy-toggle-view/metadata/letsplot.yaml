review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of both treemap and sunburst visualizations using lets-plot
    ggplot2-style API
  - Consistent color scheme across both views makes comparison intuitive
  - Interactive HTML version includes fully functional toggle button with canvas-based
    rendering
  - Good use of gggrid for combining multiple plots
  - Well-structured hierarchical data representing realistic company budget allocation
  - Nested rectangles in treemap clearly show parent-child relationships with department
    labels at top
  - Sunburst properly shows two concentric rings with appropriate labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Operations section in treemap appears cramped with minimal child labels
  - Static PNG shows both views side-by-side rather than an actual toggle control
  - Code uses helper functions which slightly deviates from KISS principle
  image_description: 'The plot displays a side-by-side comparison of two hierarchical
    visualization types: a Treemap view (left) and a Sunburst view (right). The treemap
    shows nested rectangles representing company budget allocation with 4 main departments
    (Sales in yellow #FFD43B, Engineering in blue #306998, Marketing in green #4CAF50,
    Operations in pink #E07A5F). Each department contains child rectangles for teams
    with percentage labels (e.g., Backend 15%, Frontend 12%, North 13%). The sunburst
    view shows the same data as concentric rings - departments in the inner ring and
    teams in the outer ring. Colors are consistent across both views. The title "hierarchy-toggle-view
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at top with subtitle "Company Budget Allocation
    · Toggle between views in HTML (interactive)". All text is legible and well-sized.
    The layout uses approximately 80% of the canvas with good balance.'
