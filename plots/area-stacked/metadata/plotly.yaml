review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stacked area chart with proper use of plotly stackgroup
    parameter
  - Very readable text with well-chosen font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Realistic website traffic data with meaningful upward trends over time
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of semi-transparent fills (0.7 alpha) for visual distinction between
    layers
  - Proper title format and well-positioned horizontal legend
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette includes pink and green together which may be challenging for colorblind
    users
  - All four series trend upward - showing at least one declining series would better
    demonstrate compositional changes
  - Axis labels lack units
  - Could leverage more plotly-specific features like custom hover templates
