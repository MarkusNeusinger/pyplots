review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of diverging bar chart with clear visual distinction
    between positive and negative values
  - Proper use of horizontal orientation for readable department labels
  - Well-implemented value labels at end of each bar with correct positioning and
    sign formatting
  - Good sorting of bars by value for easy comparison
  - Modern seaborn API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Clean zero baseline with solid black line provides clear reference point
  weaknesses:
  - Legend slightly overlaps with the Sales bar visual area - could be placed in upper
    left instead
  - Data scenario is somewhat generic - could use more specific real-world context
    (e.g., specific industry or year)
