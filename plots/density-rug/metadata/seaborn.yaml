review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data showcasing the KDE ability to reveal distribution shape
  - Perfect title format following spec requirements
  - Clean code structure with realistic web response time scenario
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.4 for fill, alpha=0.6 for rug)
  - Good bandwidth adjustment (bw_adjust=0.8) for smooth but accurate density estimation
  weaknesses:
  - No legend present (minor, as single series does not require one)
  - Could use more seaborn-specific features like sns.set_context for better font
    scaling
  image_description: The plot displays a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve with
    a semi-transparent blue fill (#306998) showing a clear bimodal distribution. The
    first, larger peak is centered around 120ms representing fast responses, and a
    smaller secondary peak is around 280ms representing slower responses. Along the
    x-axis at the bottom, rug marks (small vertical tick marks) show the exact location
    of individual data points with matching blue color and slight transparency. The
    title "density-rug · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clean sans-serif
    font. The x-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" and the y-axis is labeled "Density".
    A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background. The top and right spines have
    been removed for a cleaner appearance.
