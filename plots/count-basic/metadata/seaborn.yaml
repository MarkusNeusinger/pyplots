review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.countplot with proper ordering by frequency
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed spines and subtle grid
  - Count labels above bars improve readability
  - Realistic survey data scenario with believable distribution weights
  - Proper font sizing for large canvas output (4800x2700 px target)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive features like hue parameter or palette customization
  - Y-axis label could be more specific (e.g., Response Count or Frequency)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a count plot (bar chart) showing survey responses
    for preferred programming languages. Eight vertical bars are displayed in descending
    order by frequency: Python (140), JavaScript (101), Java (86), Go (43), C++ (42),
    Rust (33), TypeScript (31), and Ruby (24). The bars are a consistent blue color
    (#306998). Each bar has a count label positioned above it. The x-axis is labeled
    "Programming Language" and the y-axis is labeled "Number of Responses". The title
    follows the required format "count-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A subtle horizontal
    dashed grid is visible behind the bars, and the top and right spines have been
    removed for a cleaner appearance. The layout is well-balanced with good use of
    canvas space.'

        comment: Uses sns.countplot which is the appropriate seaborn function, but
          this is basic usage without leveraging seaborn's distinctive features like
          hue for grouping, statistical estimation, or palette customization
  verdict: APPROVED
