review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of different distribution shapes (normal, bimodal, skewed) to showcase
    violin plot capabilities
  - Creative implementation using PolygonSeries to draw violin shapes with proper
    KDE calculation
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean mirrored density visualization on both sides of each violin
  weaknesses:
  - Median markers (white circles) are not visible in the rendered plot despite being
    defined in code
  - Code contains a kde() function which violates the KISS structure requirement (should
    be inline or use scipy)
  - Axis labels lack units or more descriptive context
  - Text sizes could be increased for better visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
