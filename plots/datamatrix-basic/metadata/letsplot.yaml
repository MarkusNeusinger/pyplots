review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Data Matrix structure with correct finder and timing
    patterns
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of theme_void() for barcode visualization
  - Good canvas utilization with square aspect ratio
  - High contrast black/white color scheme ensures maximum scanability
  weaknesses:
  - White tile borders (size=0.1) add slight visual noise that real Data Matrix codes
    would not have
  - Simulated encoding rather than actual ECC 200 algorithm (acceptable for visualization
    demo)
  image_description: The plot displays a 14x14 Data Matrix 2D barcode on a white background
    with a 1-module quiet zone border. The L-shaped finder pattern is correctly implemented
    with a solid black left column and solid black bottom row. The top row shows an
    alternating black-white pattern starting with black, and the right column also
    shows an alternating pattern. The interior data region contains a pseudo-random
    pattern of black and white cells simulating encoded data. The title "datamatrix-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold gray text. The barcode is
    rendered using geom_tile with subtle white borders between cells, creating a clean
    grid appearance. The overall layout is square (1:1 ratio) with the barcode well-centered
    and taking up appropriate canvas space.
