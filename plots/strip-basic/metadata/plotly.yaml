review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Mean reference lines add valuable statistical context as suggested in spec notes
  - Appropriate jitter width (0.2) prevents overplotting while keeping points within
    category bounds
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for the data density (~50 points per group)
  - Custom hover template provides clean information display
  weaknesses:
  - Uses only 2 colors alternating across 4 groups, reducing visual distinction between
    categories
  - Legend is redundant with x-axis labels; could be removed or replaced with mean
    value annotations
  - Does not use plotly.express px.strip() which would provide native strip plot functionality
    with automatic jitter
