review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with properly sized fonts (28pt title, 22pt axis titles,
    18pt tick labels)
  - Smart date formatting with %b %Y format adapts well to yearly time span
  - Rotated x-axis labels at -45° effectively prevent overlap
  - Realistic stock price data with 252 trading days accurately represents one year
    of market data
  - Interactive features (zoom/pan and tooltips) enhance user experience
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines only appear on y-axis; x-axis grid would improve temporal data readability
    as noted in spec
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like selections, layered views, or
    conditional formatting
  - Starting price of exactly 100 feels artificial; a more realistic starting value
    would improve authenticity
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing stock price
    data over approximately one year (January 2024 to December 2024). The line is
    rendered in Python blue (#306998) with consistent stroke width. The y-axis shows
    "Stock Price ($)" ranging from approximately 76 to 120, and the x-axis shows "Date"
    with monthly tick labels formatted as "Mon YYYY" (e.g., "Feb 2024", "Mar 2024").
    The title "line-timeseries · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top.
    The x-axis labels are rotated at -45 degrees to prevent overlap. A subtle gray
    grid is visible on the y-axis. The data shows realistic stock price volatility
    with an initial decline from ~100 to ~78-80, followed by a recovery and upward
    trend reaching ~116 in November before slight decline.
