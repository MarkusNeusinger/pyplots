review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data simulation with realistic exponential decay and subtle overfitting
    behavior
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of seaborn lineplot with hue for automatic legend generation
  - Clear annotation of optimal stopping point with arrow and vertical line
  - Appropriate color choice that is both aesthetically pleasing and colorblind-safe
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned better to avoid visual competition with the annotation
    area
  image_description: 'The plot displays two line curves over 100 epochs showing neural
    network training loss. A blue line (#306998) represents "Training Loss" and a
    yellow/gold line (#FFD43B) represents "Validation Loss". Both curves start around
    2.5-2.6 and decay exponentially. The training loss (blue) decreases smoothly to
    around 0.2, while validation loss (yellow) plateaus higher around 0.35-0.4 and
    shows slight upward trend after epoch 70 (overfitting). A red dashed vertical
    line marks the optimal stopping point at epoch 90, with a red dot and arrow annotation
    pointing to "Optimal: Epoch 90". The title follows the format "line-loss-training
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". X-axis labeled "Epoch", Y-axis labeled "Cross-Entropy
    Loss". Legend in upper right corner. Subtle grid with alpha transparency.'
