quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-accessible color scheme (blue/orange instead of red/green)
  - Clean implementation of Kagi algorithm with proper yang/yin state tracking
  - Good use of line width differentiation (10 vs 2 pixels) for yang/yin distinction
  - Proper title format and well-sized text elements
  - Comprehensive hover tooltips showing trend type and price
  weaknesses:
  - Shoulder and waist markers are added in code but do not appear in the rendered
    image
  - The number of line indices (8) is fewer than desired for demonstrating meaningful
    Kagi patterns
  - Legend shows Shoulder and Waist entries but markers are invisible
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart with price movements ranging from
    approximately $89 to $117 over 8 line indices. The chart uses thick blue lines
    (labeled "Yang (Bullish)") for upward trending segments and thin orange lines
    (labeled "Yin (Bearish)") for downward trending segments. The title "kagi-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The x-axis shows "Line Index"
    (0-8) and the y-axis shows "Price ($)" (90-115). A horizontal legend at the top
    shows both line types. The chart demonstrates multiple yang/yin transitions with
    clear shoulder and waist reversal points. The background is white with subtle
    gray gridlines.
