review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements wind barb meteorological notation with proper direction convention
  - Good use of Highcharts windbarb module with proper data structure (x, y, value,
    direction)
  - Clean code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic weather station scenario with varied wind patterns
  - Proper conversion from u/v components to speed and meteorological direction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears cut off at the bottom of the image - marginBottom may need adjustment
  - X-axis label Weather Station Index appears partially truncated
  - No demonstration of calm wind notation (open circle) or pennants (50 knots) as
    mentioned in spec
  - Image height appears non-standard (2561 vs 2700)
  image_description: The plot displays a wind barb chart with 20 weather station observations.
    Wind barbs are rendered in blue (#306998) against a white background. The title
    "windbarb-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle
    "Surface Wind Observations from Weather Station Network". The x-axis shows "Weather
    Station Index" (0-18), and the y-axis shows "Wind Speed (knots)" (0-40). Each
    barb consists of a staff with attached flags/barbs indicating wind speed - short
    barbs for 5 knots, long barbs for 10 knots. The barbs point in various directions
    showing the wind direction FROM which the wind blows. The data shows a varied
    pattern with higher speeds (25-32 knots) in the left portion (stations 0-8) and
    lower speeds (3-14 knots) in the right portion (stations 12-19). The wind barb
    notation is correctly implemented with the standard meteorological convention.
    Grid lines are subtle gray. The legend shows "Surface Wind" but is partially cut
    off at the bottom of the image.
