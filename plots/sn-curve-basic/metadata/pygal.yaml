review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic fatigue test scatter using Basquin relationship
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of pygal Style for customizing colors, fonts, and sizing for the large
    canvas
  - All three material reference lines (Ultimate, Yield, Endurance Limit) with clear
    legend labels including MPa values
  - Proper logarithmic x-axis for the wide range of cycle counts
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels display as plain numbers (100, 1000, 10000) rather than scientific
    notation or superscript format - the custom x_label_formatter using Unicode superscripts
    is not rendering as intended
  - Missing the fitted S-N curve (Basquin equation line) overlay mentioned in the
    specification notes
  - Markers could be slightly larger given the moderate data density for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) for steel fatigue
    testing data. Blue circular markers represent test data points scattered across
    the plot, showing the characteristic inverse relationship between stress amplitude
    and cycles to failure. The x-axis shows "Cycles to Failure (N)" on a logarithmic
    scale ranging from 100 to 10,000,000, with labels displayed as plain numbers (100,
    1000, 10000, etc.). The y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from approximately
    150 to 550 MPa. Three horizontal reference lines are present: a red line at 520
    MPa (Ultimate Strength), a green line at 350 MPa (Yield Strength), and a purple
    line at 190 MPa (Endurance Limit). The legend is positioned at the bottom, showing
    all four series with colored squares. The title "sn-curve-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The plot has a white background with subtle vertical grid
    lines.'
