review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed packing simulation implemented inline - bubbles are tightly
    packed without overlap
  - Correct area-based scaling (sqrt transformation) for accurate visual perception
    of values
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with good visual separation between divisions
  - Appropriate use of theme_void for packed bubble charts where axes are meaningless
  - Labels abbreviated intelligently to fit inside bubbles
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows Division but could show bubble size scale to help interpret values
  - Some smaller bubbles (QA, Legal, Security) have labels that are slightly cramped
  - Does not utilize lets-plot interactive tooltip features which would be valuable
    for this chart type
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart showing department budget
    allocation across 15 departments. Bubbles are colored by three divisions: Tech
    (yellow/gold #FFD43B), Business (teal/cyan #4ECDC4), and Operations (dark blue
    #306998). The largest bubble is "Engineering" at the bottom center, followed by
    "R&D", "Product", "Sales", and "Marketing". Each bubble contains a white bold
    label inside. The bubbles are tightly packed without overlap, demonstrating the
    force-directed packing algorithm. The title "Department Budget Allocation · bubble-packed
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A legend on the right shows
    the three divisions. The background is clean white (theme_void).'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, theme_void, coord_fixed, scale_size, scale_color_manual;
          however, does not leverage lets-plot's interactive tooltips which would
          enhance this visualization
  verdict: APPROVED
