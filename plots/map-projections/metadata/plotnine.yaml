review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 4 different map projections using pure plotnine without
    geopandas/cartopy
  - 'Creative approach: manually implements projection math (Equirectangular, Mercator,
    Robinson with lookup table, Mollweide with iterative solution)'
  - Clean faceted layout using facet_wrap for comparison view
  - 'Good use of plotnine grammar: layered geom_path (graticule) + geom_polygon (continents)'
  - Appropriate color scheme with subtle graticule and good contrast
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Comprehensive theming with proper text sizes for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Simplified continent boundaries lack coastal detail compared to real world boundaries
  image_description: The plot displays four world map projections (Equirectangular,
    Mercator, Robinson, and Mollweide) arranged in a 2x2 grid layout. Each panel shows
    simplified continent shapes (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia,
    Australia, Antarctica) rendered in a blue color (#306998) with darker blue borders
    (#1a3a52). The continents are displayed on a light blue background (#E8F4F8) with
    subtle light steel blue graticule lines (#B0C4DE) showing latitude and longitude
    grid at 30-degree intervals. The title "map-projections · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text (~28pt), with a subtitle explaining the
    comparison of cartographic projections. Each projection panel has a bold label
    (Equirectangular, Mercator, Robinson, Mollweide) with a light gray background
    strip. The Equirectangular projection shows the standard plate carrée view. The
    Mercator projection displays the characteristic vertical stretching near the poles.
    The Robinson projection shows a compromise view with slightly curved edges. The
    Mollweide projection displays the characteristic elliptical boundary with curved
    graticule lines converging at the edges. Antarctica appears as a horizontal band
    at the bottom of each projection. All axes are hidden (no tick marks or axis labels)
    which is appropriate for map visualizations.
