review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color choice (blue + orange) with additional line style
    differentiation (solid vs dashed)
  - The shaded fill between curves is a creative Plotly-specific technique that visually
    emphasizes the key insight about divergence
  - 'Two well-placed annotations tell the educational story: shared peak at p=0.5
    and the divergence region'
  - Legend includes mathematical formulas for both metrics, enhancing educational
    value
  - All font sizes explicitly set with appropriate scaling for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean code structure with proper edge case handling (np.where for log(0))
  weaknesses:
  - Both Gini and entropy are normalized to [0,1] by dividing by their respective
    maxima, but the spec says Gini impurity calculated as 2*p*(1-p) which already
    peaks at 0.5, not 1.0 — the scaling makes comparison easier but slightly departs
    from the raw formula presentation
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth curves on a clean white/light gray
    background comparing Gini impurity and entropy as decision tree splitting criteria.
    The X-axis shows "Probability (p)" ranging from 0 to 1 with ticks every 0.1, and
    the Y-axis shows "Impurity Measure (normalized)" from 0 to 1 with ticks every
    0.2. The Gini curve is a solid blue line (#306998) forming a parabolic shape peaking
    at p=0.5. The entropy curve is a dashed orange line (#E69F00) that is slightly
    wider/flatter than the Gini curve, also peaking at p=0.5. A light blue shaded
    region between the two curves highlights their divergence. A dotted vertical reference
    line marks p=0.5. Two annotations with arrow pointers are present: one at the
    peak (p=0.5, y=1.0) reading "Peak: both measures = 1.0 at p = 0.5", and another
    in the lower-left area pointing to the divergence region reading "Divergence region
    — Entropy is wider than Gini". The legend is positioned at the bottom-left corner
    showing both curve labels with their mathematical formulas. The title reads "line-impurity-comparison
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top.'
