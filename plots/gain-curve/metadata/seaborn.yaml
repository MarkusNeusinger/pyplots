review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing and colorblind-safe palette
  - Complete implementation of all spec requirements including model curve, baseline,
    and perfect model
  - Realistic customer churn scenario that aligns perfectly with spec applications
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducibility via fixed seed
  - Shaded lift area effectively highlights model improvement over baseline
  weaknesses:
  - Library features could be better utilized - mostly uses basic sns.lineplot which
    offers little advantage over pure matplotlib
  - Legend placement in lower right partially overlaps the data region; upper left
    would be cleaner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative gains chart with a 16:9 landscape
    format on a white background with subtle gray gridlines. The title "gain-curve
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top in a large black font.
    The X-axis is labeled "Customers Targeted (%)" ranging from 0 to 100, and the
    Y-axis is labeled "Churners Captured (%)" ranging from 0 to ~105. Three lines
    are shown: (1) a solid dark blue line labeled "Churn Prediction Model" showing
    the cumulative gains curve with a steep initial slope that flattens as it approaches
    100%; (2) a gray dashed diagonal line labeled "Random Selection (Baseline)" representing
    random model performance; (3) a yellow/gold dotted line labeled "Perfect Model"
    that rises steeply to 100% then remains horizontal. A light blue semi-transparent
    fill highlights the area between the model curve and the baseline diagonal, illustrating
    the model''s lift over random selection. The legend is positioned in the lower
    right corner and is clearly readable.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot and sns.set_style, but these are basic seaborn
          features. The shaded area uses matplotlib's fill_between rather than a seaborn-specific
          feature
  verdict: APPROVED
