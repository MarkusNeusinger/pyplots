review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 4 distinct plot types in a cohesive 2x2 grid demonstrating
    Altair's concatenation capabilities
  - Thoughtful conditional coloring on bar chart (blue for high performers, yellow
    for lower) adds analytical value
  - Clean, consistent color scheme using Python's signature blue/yellow
  - Proper use of Altair's encoding types (Q, T, N) and scale customization
  - Good data context with a coherent financial dashboard theme
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/legend styling could be enhanced—legend font sizes could be larger for the
    line chart
  - Canvas utilization has some extra whitespace on the right side
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like interactive selections or layered
    annotations
