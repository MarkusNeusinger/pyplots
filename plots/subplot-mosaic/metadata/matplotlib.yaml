review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of plt.subplot_mosaic() with the AAB;AAB;CDE pattern -
    this is exactly what the spec asked for
  - Great variety of plot types (line with fill_between, horizontal bar, scatter,
    histogram, text metrics)
  - Clean, professional color scheme with accessible blue/yellow palette
  - Well-structured dashboard layout with clear visual hierarchy (large overview,
    medium bar chart, small detail panels)
  - Realistic sales dashboard scenario with appropriate data scales
  weaknesses:
  - Scatter plot markers could be larger (s=100 is adequate but s=150 would be more
    visible for 80 points)
  - Missing demonstration of empty cells with . placeholder mentioned in spec notes
  - Metrics panel (E) layout could be tighter - the box has significant internal whitespace
  image_description: 'The plot displays a mosaic subplot layout with 5 panels arranged
    in the pattern "AAB;AAB;CDE". The main panel (A) shows a cumulative sales time
    series with a blue line and light blue fill area, spanning the left 2/3 of the
    upper portion. Panel B on the right shows a horizontal bar chart with yellow bars
    (outlined in blue) for 4 products with value labels. The bottom row has three
    smaller panels: C shows a scatter plot with blue points, D displays a histogram
    with blue bars, and E contains a "Key Metrics" panel with text values. The main
    title "subplot-mosaic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Colors are
    primarily blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) with white backgrounds and subtle
    gray grids.'

        comment: Excellent use of plt.subplot_mosaic() which is matplotlib's signature
          feature for this task, but could also use additional matplotlib-specific
          features like annotations or color normalization
  verdict: APPROVED
