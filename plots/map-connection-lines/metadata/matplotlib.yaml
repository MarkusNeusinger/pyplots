review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of great circle arc calculation using spherical interpolation
  - Smart handling of date line crossing by splitting lines
  - Custom label offsets prevent text overlap effectively
  - Good use of line properties (width, alpha) to encode passenger volume
  - Legend is informative and well-designed with Line2D custom handles
  - Clean, readable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - File header contains stale quality score (86/100) from previous review
  - Simplified rectangular continents could benefit from a proper geographic projection
    library
  - Some routes with lower passenger volume have quite thin lines that may be less
    visible at smaller display sizes
  image_description: The plot displays a world map showing major international flight
    routes between 10 airports. The background uses a light blue color (#D4E5F7) representing
    oceans, with simplified gray rectangular continent shapes. Connection lines are
    rendered as great circle arcs in a blue color (#306998) with varying thickness
    (2-7px) and transparency (0.4-0.75) based on passenger volume. Airport locations
    are marked with prominent yellow (#FFD43B) circular markers with blue edges. City
    labels are placed near each marker with custom offsets to avoid overlap. The legend
    in the lower-left shows three line thicknesses representing passenger volume ranges
    (1.5M to 4.2M passengers/year) and an airport marker symbol. The title follows
    the correct format. Axis labels show "Longitude (°)" and "Latitude (°)" with appropriate
    tick marks. A subtle gray dashed grid is visible.
