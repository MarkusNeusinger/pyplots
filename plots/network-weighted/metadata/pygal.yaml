review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using parallel lines to simulate edge thickness in pygal (which
    lacks native stroke width control per series)
  - Force-directed layout implementation from scratch provides good node positioning
  - Three-region color coding with informative legend clearly communicates network
    structure
  - Realistic research collaboration scenario with plausible data
  - Interactive HTML output with embedded SVG
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas - could benefit
    from larger font sizes
  - Network visualization occupies less vertical space than ideal; more whitespace
    than necessary above and below the graph
  - Title uses Research Collaborations prefix instead of starting with spec-id per
    standard format
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a weighted network graph visualizing research collaborations between 13 universities. Nodes are colored by region: blue for US Universities (MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, Caltech), green for European Universities (Oxford, Cambridge, ETH Zurich, Imperial), and yellow/gold for Asian Universities (Tokyo, Tsinghua, NUS, Seoul National).

    Edges represent collaboration strength via parallel lines - thin single lines for light connections (<35 papers), double lines for medium (35-60), and quadruple parallel lines for strong connections (>60). The force-directed layout clusters regional groups while showing cross-regional bridges. The title reads "Research Collaborations · network-weighted · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend at the bottom shows all six categories (3 edge weight categories + 3 regional node groups).
