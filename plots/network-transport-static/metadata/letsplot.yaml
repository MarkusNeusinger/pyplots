review:
  strengths:
  - Clean network layout with Central station as a well-defined hub
  - Good color palette distinguishing Express (blue), Regional (gold), and Local (green)
    routes
  - Edge labels include all required information (route ID, departure → arrival times)
  - Proper use of arrows to show direction
  - Station nodes are visually distinct with dark fill and white border
  - KISS code structure with clear data preparation
  weaknesses:
  - Edge labels overlap with station labels in several places (e.g., Stadium area)
  - Title format uses "letsplot" instead of "lets-plot"
  - No curved/offset edges for multiple routes between same stations (spec mentions
    this)
  - Does not utilize lets-plot interactive features like hover tooltips (spec mentions
    this where supported)
  - Edge label font size is small relative to station labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static transport network diagram with 10
    stations (Central, North, East, South, West, Airport, University, Harbor, Tech
    Park, Stadium) arranged in a grid-like layout on a white background. Station nodes
    are rendered as dark gray filled circles with white borders. Directed edges connect
    stations with arrows indicating travel direction. Three route types are color-coded:
    Express routes (blue), Regional routes (dark yellow/gold), and Local routes (green).
    Each edge displays a label with route ID and departure/arrival times (e.g., "RE1
    | 06:15 → 06:35"). The title "network-transport-static · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. A legend on the right shows the three route types.
    The layout shows Central as the hub with Express routes radiating outward, Regional
    routes connecting outer stations, and Local routes serving the Stadium area.'
