review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of transparency (alpha=0.5) making overlapping regions clearly visible
  - Consistent bin edges across all groups using np.linspace for accurate comparison
  - Realistic salary data scenario with meaningful differences between departments
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good comments
  - Professional formatting with thousands separator on x-axis
  - Edge colors on bars improve visual definition
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only on y-axis; adding subtle x-axis grid could improve value reading
  - Could use matplotlib histtype=stepfilled or density normalization for enhanced
    visualization
