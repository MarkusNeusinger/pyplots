review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Kaplan-Meier algorithm with Greenwood formula
    for confidence intervals
  - Professional step-function visualization with properly constructed step coordinates
  - Clear visual distinction between treatment groups with accessible color scheme
  - Median survival annotation provides valuable clinical context
  - Interactive hover tooltips enhance data exploration
  - Produces both PNG and HTML output leveraging Plotly interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be cleaner by combining censored markers description or using a single
    legend entry style
  - Code complexity is higher than typical KISS style due to manual KM calculation
    (though necessary without lifelines library)
