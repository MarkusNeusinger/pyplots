review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard layout with clear visual hierarchy (large values, supporting
    context)
  - Smart colorblind-friendly palette choice (blue/orange/purple instead of red/green)
  - Good implementation of change indicator logic that considers whether increases
    or decreases are favorable per metric type
  - Clean sparklines with fill_between for visual appeal
  - Proper seaborn integration with sns.lineplot for the sparkline visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels scoring (VQ-06) does not apply well to dashboard tiles - awarded 0/2
    per strict criteria but this is a limitation of the rubric for this visualization
    type
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3x2 grid dashboard with 6 metric tiles on a white background. The title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.

    Row 1 (left to right):
    - CPU Usage: Shows 45% in blue (#0173B2), with a down arrow and "-5.2%" change indicator in blue (favorable). Green sparkline with light fill at bottom.
    - Memory: Shows 72% in orange (#DE8F05 warning color), with up arrow and "+8.1%" change in purple (unfavorable). Orange/yellow sparkline with light fill.
    - Response Time: Shows 120ms in blue (good status), with down arrow and "-15.3%" in blue (favorable). Blue/green sparkline with fill.

    Row 2 (left to right):
    - Active Users: Shows 1,847 in blue (good), up arrow with "+12.7%" in blue (favorable - higher users is good). Blue sparkline.
    - Error Rate: Shows 2.3% in purple (#CC78BC critical), up arrow with "+45.0%" in purple (unfavorable - higher errors is bad). Pink/red sparkline.
    - Throughput: Shows 892req/s in blue (good), down arrow with "-3.4%" in purple (unfavorable - lower throughput is bad).

    Each tile has a light gray background (#f8f9fa) with subtle borders, metric name at top in gray, large prominent value in center, change indicator below, and an embedded sparkline at the bottom showing trend history. The colorblind-friendly palette uses blue for good, orange for warning, and purple for critical states.

          Could leverage more seaborn features, but appropriate for dashboard visualization.
