review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of mosaic layout concept with 6 diverse subplots of varying
    sizes
  - Cohesive visual design with Python brand colors (blue/yellow) and consistent styling
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with meaningful metrics (revenue, profitability,
    sales, satisfaction)
  - Good use of Bokeh row/column layout system to create asymmetric grid
  - Legends are consistently styled with appropriate font sizes and background alpha
  - All subplots have clear, descriptive titles and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Code defines unused data sources (source_e1, source_e2 for conversion rate) that
    clutter the implementation
  - The Theme object is imported and defined but never applied via curdoc; apply_theme()
    duplicates this functionality
  - Helper function apply_theme() breaks KISS principle; grid styling could be inlined
  - Font sizes on smaller subplots (conversion rate, satisfaction) could be slightly
    larger for better readability
  - Could demonstrate Bokeh interactive features (hover tools, linked brushing) for
    richer dashboard experience
