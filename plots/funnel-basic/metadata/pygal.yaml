review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native Funnel chart type with proper data structure
  - Clean, distinct color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Values displayed on each segment with proper number formatting (comma separators)
  - Legend correctly identifies all stages with matching colors
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic sales funnel data matching the specification example exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Value formatter includes percentage but only raw numbers display on the chart
  - Large vertical gap between funnel visualization and bottom legend creates visual
    imbalance
  - Horizontal funnel orientation differs from spec description of top to bottom narrowing
    (pygal library design choice)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal funnel chart with 5 stages representing
    a sales conversion funnel. From left to right: Awareness (blue, 1,000), Interest
    (yellow, 600), Consideration (teal, 400), Intent (peach, 200), and Purchase (olive
    green, 100). Each segment is trapezoidal and narrows progressively toward the
    right, forming a pointed funnel shape. The title "funnel-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. A legend at the bottom identifies each stage with colored
    markers. The values are displayed as formatted numbers (with comma separators)
    on each segment.'

          however the value_formatter doesn't appear to be rendering the percentage
          portion
  verdict: APPROVED
