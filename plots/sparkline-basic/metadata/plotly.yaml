review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of sparkline minimalism - no axes, gridlines, or labels
    as specified
  - Clean use of Plotly graph_objects with multiple traces for different highlight
    points
  - 'Good color choices: Python blue for line, semantic colors for min (red) and max
    (green)'
  - Proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with scale=3
  - Includes both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic data scenario (daily sales with upward trend and noise)
  weaknesses:
  - The first point yellow marker partially overlaps with the line start, making it
    slightly less visible than the last point marker
  image_description: 'The plot displays a minimalist sparkline visualization on a
    white background. A single blue (#306998) line traces a trend with 30 data points,
    showing an overall upward trajectory with natural fluctuations. The line is clean
    with width appropriate for the canvas size. Four colored markers highlight key
    points: two yellow dots mark the first and last data points (left edge and right
    edge), a red dot marks the minimum value (in the lower middle portion), and a
    green dot marks the maximum value (upper portion). The title "sparkline-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in a dark font. There are no
    axes, gridlines, tick labels, or legends - exactly as a sparkline should be. The
    chart uses the full width of the canvas with appropriate margins.'
