review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution showing both views side-by-side since seaborn lacks
    native interactive toggle
  - Consistent color scheme across both visualization types using seaborn Set2 palette
  - Good use of seaborn styling capabilities (set_theme, set_context)
  - Clean professional layout with proper title format
  - Realistic and appropriate data scenario (software budget allocation)
  - Well-proportioned hierarchy with clear parent-child relationships
  - Effective use of rounded rectangles and wedges for visual appeal
  weaknesses:
  - Some text labels in sunburst outer ring are truncated or hard to read (Cloud label
    appears upside-down)
  - Treemap uses manual matplotlib patches rather than any seaborn-specific visualization
  - Missing the interactive toggle capability specified in the spec (static alternative
    is reasonable but not ideal)
  - No seaborn plot functions used - only styling and color utilities
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a side-by-side comparison of two hierarchical visualization types for software project budget allocation data.

    **Left (Treemap View):** Four vertical columns representing main categories (Development $600K in teal, Infrastructure $310K in coral/orange, Operations $240K in blue-purple, Research $200K in pink). Each column contains nested rectangles for subcategories with labels showing names and dollar amounts (e.g., Frontend $180K, Backend $220K, Cloud $150K, ML/AI $130K). Category totals are shown at the bottom of each column with a colored background pill.

    **Right (Sunburst View):** A concentric ring chart with an inner ring showing the four main categories and an outer ring showing their subcategories. The center displays "Total $1350K" with a white circle. Labels are radially oriented in the outer ring with category names in the inner ring. Colors are consistent with the treemap view (same palette: teal, orange, purple, pink from seaborn's Set2).

    **Overall Layout:** Main title at top ("hierarchy-toggle-view · seaborn · pyplots.ai") with subtitle. A shared legend at the bottom shows the four categories with consistent colors. The background is white with clean, professional styling.
