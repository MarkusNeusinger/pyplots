review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of what an interactive bar chart would look like
    when hovered
  - Creative use of annotation boxes with arrows to simulate tooltip behavior
  - Good data context with calculated percentages and growth rates
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper color scheme with good accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement competes with tooltip annotation - consider repositioning or
    removing since it describes implementation rather than data
  - Matplotlib is a static library; the spec explicitly notes this plot type is best
    suited for interactive libraries - the implementation is a visual mockup of interactivity,
    not true interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing sales revenue
    by product category. Eight categories are displayed along the x-axis (Electronics,
    Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Automotive, Health) with sales values
    on the y-axis ranging from $0K to over $100K. The first bar (Electronics) is highlighted
    in Python Yellow (#FFD43B) to simulate a hover state, while all other bars are
    Python Blue (#306998). Each bar has a dark blue edge for definition and displays
    the value label (e.g., "$88K") above it. A tooltip annotation box with an arrow
    points to the highlighted Electronics bar, showing: Category name, Sales amount
    ($87,500), Share (22.4%), Growth (+3.9%), and "[Click to drill down]" text. A
    legend in the upper right explains the color coding for normal and hovered bars.
    The grid is subtle with dashed horizontal lines. The title follows the correct
    format: "bar-interactive · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
