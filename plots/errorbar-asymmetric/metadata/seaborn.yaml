review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements following the guidelines
    exactly
  - Clear demonstration of asymmetric error bars with visible caps as specified
  - Good data context (battery life) that clearly shows asymmetric uncertainty
  - Annotation explaining the error bar meaning (10th-90th percentile) as required
    by spec
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - The annotation box placement in the corner is functional but a proper legend entry
    might integrate better with the plot
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib for the core errorbar functionality rather than showcasing
    seaborn-specific features
