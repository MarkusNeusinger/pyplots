review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between raw data (blue, semi-transparent) and rolling
    average (yellow, prominent)
  - Realistic temperature scenario with clear seasonal pattern that demonstrates the
    value of rolling averages
  - Proper handling of NaN values at rolling window boundaries by creating separate
    data sources
  - Interactive tools included (pan, wheel_zoom, box_zoom, reset, save) and HTML output
    generated
  - Clean KISS code structure following Bokeh best practices with ColumnDataSource
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small at the top left corner when viewing the full-resolution
    image
  - Could add HoverTool to display exact date and temperature values on hover for
    better interactivity
