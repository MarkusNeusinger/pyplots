review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lollipop chart using plotnine grammar of graphics
    (geom_segment + geom_point)
  - Clean minimalist aesthetic with theme_minimal and carefully tuned grid settings
  - Proper categorical ordering using pd.Categorical to maintain sorted order
  - Text sizing follows library guidelines perfectly (title=24, axis_title=20, axis_text=16)
  - Data sorted ascending for clear visual progression from lowest to highest
  weaknesses:
  - Could use slightly larger markers (size=8 instead of 6) to make the lollipop dots
    more prominent
  image_description: The plot displays a basic lollipop chart showing product sales
    by category. Ten categories are shown on the x-axis (Automotive, Garden, Beauty,
    Toys, Books, Sports, Groceries, Clothing, Furniture, Electronics), sorted in ascending
    order by value. The y-axis shows "Sales (thousands $)" ranging from 0 to 250.
    Each data point consists of a thin blue stem (#306998) extending from the baseline
    (y=0) to a circular blue marker at the data value. The title "lollipop-basic ·
    plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. X-axis category labels are rotated
    45 degrees for readability. Subtle dashed horizontal grid lines provide value
    reference. The overall aesthetic is clean and minimalist with good use of whitespace.
