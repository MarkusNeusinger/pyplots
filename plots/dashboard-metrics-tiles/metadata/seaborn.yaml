review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clean, professional dashboard appearance
  - Correct implementation of all spec requirements (tiles, sparklines, change indicators)
  - Smart handling of favorable/unfavorable change direction based on metric type
  - Good color coding for status (good/warning/critical)
  - Proper KISS code structure with seed for reproducibility
  - Title format is correct
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: seaborn library is not used at all - the import statement exists but
    no seaborn functions are called. This is a matplotlib-only implementation labeled
    as seaborn.'
  - Red-green color scheme may cause accessibility issues for colorblind users
  - The implementation needs to actually use seaborn plotting functions (e.g., sns.lineplot
    for sparklines, seaborn styling/theming)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3x2 grid of 6 dashboard metric tiles on a white background. Each tile has a light gray background (#f8f9fa) with subtle gray borders.

    Row 1 (left to right):
    - CPU Usage: Shows "45%" in green, with "▼ 5.2%" in green below (decrease is good), and a green sparkline with light green fill
    - Memory: Shows "72%" in yellow/amber, with "▲ 8.1%" in red below (increase is bad), and a yellow/amber sparkline with light fill
    - Response Time: Shows "120ms" in green, with "▼ 15.3%" in green below (decrease is good), and a green sparkline with light fill

    Row 2 (left to right):
    - Active Users: Shows "1,847" in green, with "▲ 12.7%" in green below (increase is good), and a green sparkline
    - Error Rate: Shows "2.3%" in red, with "▲ 45.0%" in red below (increase is bad), and a red sparkline
    - Throughput: Shows "892req/s" in green, with "▼ 3.4%" in red below (decrease is bad), and a green sparkline

    The title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in large bold text. All tiles have consistent sizing with metric names at top, large centered values, change indicators below values, and sparklines at the bottom. Colors correctly indicate status (green=good, yellow=warning, red=critical) and change direction is appropriately colored based on whether up/down is favorable for each metric type.
