  strengths:
  - Excellent data variety with 4 distinct distribution shapes showcasing violin plot
    strengths
  - Rich interactive tooltips showing complete statistical summary per group
  - 'All spec features implemented cleanly: mirrored density, IQR boxes, median lines'
  - Perfect text legibility with explicitly set font sizes throughout
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual harmony
  weaknesses:
  - 'Design Excellence remains the main gap: good but not yet publication-quality
    polish'
  - IQR boxes are quite narrow (box_width=0.06), reducing their visual impact as quartile
    markers
  - No visual emphasis or focal point to guide the viewer toward a specific insight
  - Manual polygon construction limits idiomatic Highcharts usage (inherent to the
    approach)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 violin shapes representing test score distributions
    across study groups: Control (steel blue, #306998), Tutorial (gold, #E5AB00),
    Self-Study (purple, #9467BD), and Intensive (cyan, #17BECF). Each violin has mirrored
    KDE density contours with a semi-transparent fill (opacity ~0.55). Inside each
    violin, a narrow dark rectangle shows the interquartile range (Q1-Q3) and a white
    horizontal line marks the median. The Control violin is centered around 50 with
    a roughly normal bell shape. The Tutorial violin is wider and shows a bimodal
    bulge around 40 and 65. The Self-Study violin is centered higher around 60 with
    a normal shape. The Intensive violin is right-skewed with a lower center (~38)
    and a long thin tail extending up to ~103. The title reads "violin-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Distribution of scores across 200 students per
    group". Y-axis labeled "Test Score (points)" from 0-110, X-axis labeled "Study
    Group". Legend in top-right shows all 4 groups plus "Median". Background is white
    with subtle gray gridlines.'
