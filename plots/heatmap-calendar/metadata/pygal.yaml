review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style green color scheme that is instantly recognizable and colorblind-friendly
  - Creative solution extending pygal Graph class to implement a chart type not natively
    supported
  - Well-positioned legend with numeric value ranges for easy interpretation
  - Realistic contribution data pattern with weekday/weekend variation and random
    spikes
  - Clean month and weekday labeling with good font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Calendar grid could be vertically larger to better utilize the canvas space (currently
    ~35-40% vertical utilization)
  - Some cells appear quite small relative to the large canvas size
