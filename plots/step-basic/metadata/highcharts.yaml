review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step chart implementation with correct left step style creating proper
    staircase pattern
  - Clear readable text at all sizes (title 72px, axis labels 48px, tick labels 36px)
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario with appropriate data values
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines exactly
  - Proper PNG export using Selenium with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears enabled but not visible in rendered image - may need positioning
    adjustment
  - Only demonstrates one step style (left) when spec mentions pre/post/mid options
  - Layout has slightly unbalanced margins
