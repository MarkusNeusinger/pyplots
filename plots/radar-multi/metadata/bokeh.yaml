review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the radar chart geometry using manual polygon construction
    with patch()
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of transparency (alpha=0.25) allowing overlapping areas to be visible
  - Good color choices with distinct colors for each series
  - Correct title format and professional appearance
  - Both PNG and HTML output provided, leveraging Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned outside the main plot area with some visual separation
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (blue-yellow combination)
  - Grid value labels are slightly small relative to axis labels
  image_description: 'The plot shows a multi-series radar chart comparing three products
    (Product A, B, C) across 6 attributes: Performance, Ease of Use, Price Value,
    Support, Features, and Reliability. The chart uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with
    circular gridlines at intervals of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. Product A is shown in
    blue (#306998), Product B in yellow (#FFD43B), and Product C in a coral/red color
    (#E57373). Each series is rendered as a filled polygon with transparency (~0.25
    alpha) and distinct colored outlines. The polygons overlap visually, showing different
    strengths for each product. Axis labels are positioned at the outer edges, and
    a legend is placed on the right side identifying each product. The title "radar-multi
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.'

        comment: Title, axis labels, and grid values are clearly readable. Font sizes
          are appropriate for the canvas size.

        passed: true
        comment: Blue, yellow, and coral provide reasonable contrast, though blue-yellow
          could be challenging for some colorblind users.

        comment: Good use of canvas with the radar chart centered. Legend is appropriately
          placed on the right side, though slightly separated from the main chart.

        comment: Uses Bokeh's figure, ColumnDataSource for labels, LabelSet, Legend
          with customization, and export_png/save for HTML output. Could leverage
          more interactive features.
