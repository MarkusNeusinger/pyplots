review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating annotation heights to prevent label overlap
  - High-quality visual design with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean color scheme with good contrast (blue line, yellow annotations)
  - Interactive hover templates provide rich information
  - Realistic stock price scenario with appropriate event types
  - Proper use of Plotly shape and annotation features
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible at 0.2-0.3
  - Does not leverage Plotly-specific interactive features like rangeslider
  - Creates both PNG and HTML outputs when only PNG is required
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart of stock price data (USD) from
    January 2024 to November 2024, with prices ranging from ~$85 to ~$115. The main
    data line is rendered in a deep blue color (#306998) with a width of 4. Seven
    event annotations are positioned throughout the chart using yellow (#FFD43B) vertical
    dashed lines extending from the x-axis to label boxes at alternating heights (avoiding
    overlap). Each event is marked on the price line itself with a yellow diamond
    marker with a blue border. The events shown are: Q4 Earnings, Product Launch,
    Q1 Earnings, Expansion Announced, Q2 Earnings, Partnership Deal, and Q3 Earnings.
    The title "line-annotated-events · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The Y-axis shows "Stock Price (USD)" with dollar sign prefix on tick labels, and
    X-axis shows "Date". A legend in the upper left identifies the "Stock Price" trace.
    The background is white with subtle gray gridlines.'

          hover templates are nice but could leverage more plotly-specific features
