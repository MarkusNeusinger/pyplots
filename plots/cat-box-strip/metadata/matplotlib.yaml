review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing different distributions, spreads, and outliers across
    groups
  - Clean combination of boxplot and scatter overlay with proper jitter
  - Yellow median line provides excellent contrast against blue boxes
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for data density
  - Correct use of patch_artist for filled boxes
  - Code follows KISS principle perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Response Value (units)" or "Score")
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like custom boxplot statistics or violinplot
    overlay for more library-distinctive implementation
