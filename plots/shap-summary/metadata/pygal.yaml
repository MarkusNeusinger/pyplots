review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good use of numpy for data
    generation
  - Appropriate credit risk scenario that is realistic and neutral
  - Good use of pygal HorizontalBar chart type with custom styling
  - Features correctly sorted by mean absolute SHAP value (most important at top)
  - Title format correctly follows the required pattern
  weaknesses:
  - 'Wrong plot type: Implemented a bar chart instead of the required SHAP summary
    plot (beeswarm/dot distribution)'
  - Missing individual sample points - each sample should be a dot positioned by its
    SHAP value
  - Missing feature value color gradient (blue=low to red=high feature values) that
    is essential for SHAP interpretation
  - Missing vertical reference line at x=0 to separate positive/negative impacts
  - Does not show the distribution shape that reveals feature effect patterns
