review:
  strengths:
  - Clean data representation with study names and CI bounds displayed on Y-axis labels
  - Good use of color contrast between study markers (blue) and pooled estimate (yellow)
  - Proper null reference line at x=0 as dashed vertical line
  - Weight-proportional marker sizing implemented correctly
  - Appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Pooled estimate diamond is rendered as a circle rather than the traditional diamond
    shape specified in the requirements
  - CI whiskers extend beyond the visible plot area on the right side, creating visual
    artifacts
  - Legend at bottom is redundant and cluttered; forest plots typically do not need
    a legend as the visual encoding is standard
  - The diamond outline attempt using 4 line segments is not visible/effective
