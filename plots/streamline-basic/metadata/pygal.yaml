review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround for pygal's lack of native streamline support using XY line
    plots
  - Correct vortex flow field implementation (u = -y, v = x)
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate comments
  - Good use of canvas space and readable title/labels
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels in rendered image appear inconsistent with code (5 categories shown
    vs 4 in code)
  - Color scheme uses similar shades (blue tones, tan tones) that reduce distinguishability
  - Streamlines are thin relative to the large canvas size
  - Flow speed labeling (Slow/Fast Flow) is physically inaccurate for vortex flow
    where inner radii have higher angular velocity
