quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen blue/yellow color scheme that provides
    high contrast
  - Perfect implementation of learning curve concept showing classic overfitting pattern
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar usage with geom_ribbon for confidence bands
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units/scale indicator (e.g., Accuracy Score 0-1)
  - Could demonstrate more lets-plot specific features like tooltips or interactive
    elements
