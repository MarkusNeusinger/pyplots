review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to represent phylogenetic tree structure
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color palette for species markers
  - Includes proper scale bar with units for evolutionary distance interpretation
  - Species labels are clearly positioned next to their markers without overlap
  - Scientifically accurate primate evolutionary relationships represented
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function which deviates from KISS principle
  - Tree is somewhat compressed with unused whitespace on the right side of the canvas
  - Y-axis grid lines are visible but serve no purpose for tree visualization
