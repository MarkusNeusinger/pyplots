review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource for data management,
    LinearColorMapper with transform() for color encoding, LabelSet for cell annotations'
  - Smart dynamic text color calculation (white on dark cells, dark blue on light
    cells) ensures all annotations are readable
  - Square 3600x3600 format is ideal for confusion matrix visualization
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with plausible confusion patterns (adjacent
    classes more likely to be confused)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good comments explaining choices
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: X-axis labels have slight rotation (0.4 rad) which is not strictly necessary
    for 4 short class names'
  - 'VQ-07: Could add slightly more styling to the colorbar or include summary statistics'
