review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of real-world data (Wine dataset) producing authentic PCA results
    with natural elbow and threshold crossings
  - Strong visual storytelling with highlighted elbow point, threshold bands, and
    drop-line annotation guiding the viewer
  - All spec features implemented including the optional individual variance overlay
    as subtle secondary markers
  - Publication-quality typography with all font sizes explicitly set per library
    guidelines
  - Idiomatic plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layer composition
  weaknesses:
  - Threshold labels (90%/95%/99%) are slightly crowded in the upper region — spacing
    could be improved
  - Individual variance squares at the bottom are very subtle (alpha=0.15) and may
    not add much visual value in the current presentation
  - Layout could make better use of vertical space — the bottom 20% is mostly empty
    aside from the faint individual variance markers
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA component selection using the Wine dataset (13 components). The main cumulative
    line is drawn in Python Blue (#306998) with white-filled circle markers at each
    discrete component. An elbow point at component 2 (55.4%) is prominently highlighted
    with a larger orange-red filled marker and a bold annotation label offset to the
    upper-right, along with a dotted vertical drop-line to the x-axis. Three horizontal
    dashed threshold lines are shown at 90% (orange), 95% (green), and 99% (blue),
    each with corresponding colored shaded bands and bold text labels positioned at
    x=5.5. Subtle square markers near the bottom of the chart represent individual
    variance ratios for each component, providing a secondary data layer. The y-axis
    shows percentages from 0% to 100%, and the x-axis shows component numbers 1 through
    13. The title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in
    bold at the top-left. The background is a light gray panel on white, with minimal
    horizontal gridlines.
