review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of customer journey e-commerce data that clearly demonstrates
    the parallel categories concept
  - Creative implementation using Altair layers (bezier curves for flows, rect marks
    for boxes, text marks for labels)
  - Good color scheme for the Channel dimension with distinct colors that aid flow
    tracing
  - Correct title format and proper PNG/HTML output
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Column dimension headers appear below the boxes rather than above them, causing
    confusion about which column represents which dimension
  - Middle and right columns use uniform gray color instead of extending the color
    scheme, making it harder to trace flows visually
  - No explicit legend explaining the color-to-channel mapping
  - Some flow ribbons are quite thin and hard to trace across the diagram
  - Count labels are small and positioned inconsistently
