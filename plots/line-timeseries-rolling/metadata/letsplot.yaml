review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-layer visualization clearly distinguishing raw data from smoothed
    trend
  - Appropriate use of alpha/size differentiation to show raw data as secondary and
    rolling average as primary
  - Realistic temperature sensor scenario with seasonal variation matches specification
    perfectly
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation
  - Proper legend placement at top with clear labeling including window size
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears as three separate legend groups (color, alpha, size) instead of
    a unified legend - consider using guides() to merge them
  - Raw data line could be slightly thicker for better visibility while maintaining
    transparency
