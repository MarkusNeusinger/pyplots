review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - 'Excellent data context: daily temperature readings with realistic seasonal patterns'
  - Good visual quality with appropriate font sizes and colorblind-friendly colors
  - Creative attempt to visually represent what interactive features would look like
  weaknesses:
  - 'FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATION: Seaborn is a static visualization library built on matplotlib.
    It cannot provide true interactivity (hover tooltips, zoom, pan, range selection,
    reset buttons, animations). The spec explicitly requires these features.'
  - The implementation uses static annotations and shading to simulate interactivity,
    but these are not actual interactive features
  - For truly interactive line charts, libraries like Plotly, Bokeh, Altair, or Highcharts
    are appropriate
