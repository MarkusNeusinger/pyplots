review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with excellent text legibility
  - Correct ECDF implementation with proper step function
  - Perfect title format following spec requirements
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with theme customization
  - Appropriate figure sizing (16x9) and DPI (300)
  weaknesses:
  - Manual ECDF computation instead of using plotnine native stat_ecdf() which would
    be more idiomatic
  - Axis label Values is generic and lacks units or more descriptive context
