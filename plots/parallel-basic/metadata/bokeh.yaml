review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent normalization implementation with original value ranges preserved in
    axis labels
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.5) to handle 150 overlapping lines
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good visual distinction between species
  - Proper title format and comprehensive legend with species title
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use ColumnDataSource which is the recommended Bokeh pattern for data
    handling
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive exploration of individual data points
  - Legend font size could be larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Could benefit from vertical axis lines to better delineate dimensions
