review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polynomial regression with R² calculation using numpy
  - Clear visualization of diminishing returns economic concept
  - 95% confidence band adds statistical depth
  - Polynomial equation prominently displayed with proper formatting
  - Color scheme (Python blue/gold) is distinctive and accessible
  - All text elements properly sized for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in lower right overlaps slightly with data region; could be placed
    outside or in an empty corner
  - Uses only basic matplotlib/numpy; scipy.stats or sklearn could provide more sophisticated
    polynomial fitting
  - Generic axis units (units) rather than more specific economic terms
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with polynomial regression
    on a 16:9 canvas. The scatter points are blue (#306998) with white edges and moderate
    transparency (alpha ~0.6), showing 80 data points. A prominent yellow/gold (#FFD43B)
    quadratic curve fits through the data, surrounded by a light yellow semi-transparent
    95% confidence band. The title reads "scatter-regression-polynomial · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Investment (units)" and y-axis
    "Return (units)". A white annotation box in the upper left shows the polynomial
    equation (y = -0.47x² + 5.69x + 5.20) and R² = 0.859. A legend in the lower right
    shows three items: Data points, 95% confidence band, and Polynomial fit (degree
    2). Grid lines are subtle with dashed style. The parabolic curve peaks around
    x=6, demonstrating diminishing returns.'
