review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly set at appropriate scales
    for 4800x2700
  - Adaptive data label colors (white on dark cells, dark on light cells) enhance
    readability and demonstrate Highcharts formatter capability
  - Realistic neutral dataset (website traffic by day/time) with clear patterns showing
    business-hour peaks
  - Good data storytelling with subtitle and visual hierarchy creating an obvious
    focal point at peak hours
  - Clean KISS structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses an unconventional blue-purple-red gradient that is not perceptually
    uniform and may cause issues for colorblind users — a standard sequential palette
    would be more accessible and visually smoother
  - The right-side legend is slightly cramped against the canvas edge — the Visits/hr
    title and scale labels could use more breathing room
  - The blue-to-purple transition around the 60-70 range creates a visual discontinuity
    that can make relative comparisons harder
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x7 heatmap titled "Website Traffic · heatmap-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Visits per hour — weekday business
    hours show clear peak activity." The x-axis shows days of the week (Mon-Sun) labeled
    "Day of Week" and the y-axis shows time periods (6-9 AM through 3-6 AM) labeled
    "Time Period." Each cell contains a numeric annotation showing visits per hour.
    The color scale runs from very light blue (low values near 0) through medium blue,
    dark blue/teal, into purple at mid-high values, and finally red for the highest
    values (near 100). A vertical color legend on the right labeled "Visits / hr"
    maps colors to values 0-100. The highest value (100) appears in the Fri / 9 AM-Noon
    cell shown in bright red. Weekday business hours (9 AM-6 PM, Mon-Fri) are visibly
    darker/warmer. Late-night rows (Mid-3 AM, 3-6 AM) are very pale with single-digit
    values. Cell borders are thin and match the #fafafa background, giving a clean
    grid appearance. Text labels adapt color — white on dark cells, dark on light
    cells.'
