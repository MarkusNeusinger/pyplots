review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation with group clustering (200 iterations,
    proper cooling)
  - 'Clean use of ggplot2 grammar: geom_segment for edges (drawn first), geom_point
    for nodes, geom_text for labels'
  - Node degree-based sizing adds meaningful information about network centrality
  - 'Colorblind-accessible 4-color palette starting with Python blue #306998'
  - Proper label offset positioning (y + 0.04) to reduce overlap with nodes
  - Realistic office social network scenario with believable department structure
    and cross-department bridges
  - Theme properly hides axes, grid, and ticks for clean network visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend markers appear as small dots rather than matching the actual node sizes
    shown in the plot
  - Some label pairs are slightly close together (Leo/Kate, Noah/Mia areas) though
    not overlapping
