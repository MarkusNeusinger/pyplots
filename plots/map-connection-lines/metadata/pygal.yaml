review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of curved Bézier lines to represent flight routes, avoiding overlapping
    straight lines
  - Clear volume-based categorization with distinct colors (blue, red, orange) and
    line thicknesses
  - Well-implemented geographic context with detailed coastline outlines covering
    all continents
  - Clean legend organization at bottom with 5 columns
  - Realistic flight route data with major international airports and plausible passenger
    volumes
  - Good use of alpha transparency to handle overlapping routes
  - Proper axis labels with degree units
  weaknesses:
  - Some route congestion in Europe hub area makes individual routes difficult to
    trace
  - The coastline rendering is simplified polygonal outlines rather than actual map
    data, which is acceptable given pygal limitations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map connection lines visualization
    showing international flight routes between major airports. The background is
    light blue representing ocean, with gray coastline outlines providing geographic
    context. Routes are displayed as curved lines (Bézier curves) connecting airport
    locations marked as black dots. The routes are color-coded by passenger volume:
    blue lines for routes under 2 million passengers, red lines for 2-3 million passengers,
    and orange lines for routes over 3 million passengers. The route lines have varying
    thickness corresponding to volume categories. The title "map-connection-lines
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels show "Longitude (°)" and
    "Latitude (°)" with appropriate degree units. A legend at the bottom shows five
    categories: Coastlines, Routes < 2M, Routes 2-3M, Routes > 3M, and Airports. The
    14 airport locations are clearly visible as large black dots distributed across
    North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia.'
