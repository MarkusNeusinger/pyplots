review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts xrange series type for Gantt chart implementation
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with distinct category colors
  - Well-implemented Today marker with red plotLine and label
  - Professional project management scenario with realistic task names and durations
  - Good typography scaling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Proper category-based legend with series per category
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols are relatively small compared to the large canvas
  - Could add task duration in tooltip for enhanced interactivity
  - Left margin (420px) is slightly larger than necessary
  image_description: 'The plot displays a well-structured Gantt chart showing a software
    project timeline from January to April 2025. The chart has 12 tasks listed vertically
    on the left (Requirements Analysis, System Design, Database Schema, Backend API,
    Frontend UI, Integration, Unit Testing, System Testing, User Acceptance, Documentation,
    Training, Go Live). Horizontal bars represent task durations with four distinct
    colors: blue (#306998) for Planning tasks, yellow (#FFD43B) for Development, purple
    (#9467BD) for Testing, and cyan (#17BECF) for Deployment. A prominent red vertical
    line marks "Today (Feb 15)" with a label above it. The X-axis shows the timeline
    with dates, and a legend at the bottom clearly identifies the four categories.
    The layout is clean with good spacing between task bars.'

        comment: Uses xrange module for Gantt, plotLines for today marker, proper
          datetime handling; could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like
          tooltips with task duration
  verdict: APPROVED
