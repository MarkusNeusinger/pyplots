review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept with proper radial axis arrangement
    at 120-degree intervals
  - Beautiful curved bezier edges through center point create visually appealing connections
  - Good color scheme using Python blue, yellow, and teal that is accessible and distinctive
  - Realistic software module dependency example that exactly matches the specification
    suggested scenario
  - Edge transparency (alpha=0.4) prevents visual clutter while maintaining connection
    visibility
  - White edge borders on nodes provide good contrast against axis lines
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a helper function node_to_cartesian() instead of inline calculation (minor
    KISS violation)
  - Figure size is 12x12 instead of recommended 16x9 default from library rules
  - Node labels could benefit from slightly larger font size (18pt instead of 16pt)
    for better readability
