review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts step function for authentic Kaplan-Meier visualization
  - Beautiful confidence interval bands using AreaRangeSeries with appropriate transparency
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow)
  - Proper Greenwood formula implementation for confidence intervals
  - Clean separation between two treatment groups with distinct visual styling
  - Correct title format and informative subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Censored observation markers are not visible on the plot (the code creates ScatterSeries
    for them but they do not appear as tick marks on the survival curves as specified)
  - Contains a function definition (kaplan_meier) which violates the KISS principle
    of no functions/classes
  - Legend is positioned in corner away from the data
