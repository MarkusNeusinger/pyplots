review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the scatter plot matrix with histograms on diagonal
    and scatter plots off-diagonal
  - Proper use of color encoding to distinguish three species with legend grouping
  - Axis labels include units (cm) and are placed correctly on matrix edges
  - Good data generation mimicking real Iris dataset with species-specific distributions
  - Correct title format and square image format appropriate for matrix visualization
  - Clean, readable code structure with appropriate transparency and marker sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use plotly.express scatter_matrix or px.splom which would be more idiomatic
    for this visualization type
  - Yellow color for Versicolor may have accessibility issues for some colorblind
    users
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the top-right scatter cell data area
