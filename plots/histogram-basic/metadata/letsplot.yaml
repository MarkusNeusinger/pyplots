review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured to correct
    values
  - Clean minimal theme with thoughtful grid removal (no x-grid, no minor grid, subtle
    y-grid)
  - Bimodal data (mixed male/female heights) effectively demonstrates histogram distribution
    features
  - Idiomatic lets-plot code following KISS structure perfectly
  - Uses layer_tooltips() for the HTML export — a distinctive lets-plot feature
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the bimodal nature of the distribution is not highlighted
    with annotations, mean/median lines, or text labels pointing out the two underlying
    populations'
  - Could benefit from a subtitle or annotation explaining the height data context
  - Minor right-side whitespace from low-frequency tail bins
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of human height measurements in
    centimeters. The bars are filled with a muted steel blue (#306998) with white
    edge lines separating them. The x-axis is labeled "Height (cm)" ranging from approximately
    140 to 205 cm with tick marks at every 5 cm. The y-axis is labeled "Frequency"
    ranging from 0 to 60. The distribution is roughly bimodal — a broad peak near
    165–170 cm with a visible shoulder around 175–180 cm — reflecting the combined
    male and female height distributions. The title "histogram-basic · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears in the upper-left corner. The background is clean with a minimal
    theme: no vertical grid lines, no minor grid, and only subtle light gray horizontal
    grid lines. The plot fills the 16:9 canvas well with balanced margins.'
