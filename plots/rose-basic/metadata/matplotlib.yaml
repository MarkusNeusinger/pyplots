review:
  strengths:
  - Clean polar bar implementation with proper theta direction (clockwise from north)
  - Good use of white edge lines to separate segments visually
  - Appropriate canvas size (16x9 at 300dpi = 4800x2700)
  - Realistic monthly rainfall data with clear seasonal pattern
  - Title correctly follows the required format with units
  weaknesses:
  - Radial tick labels overlap slightly with the Feb month label at the top-right
  - No legend or explicit radial axis label explaining that radius = rainfall (mm)
  - Data variation is moderate; more dramatic peaks/valleys would better showcase
    the rose chart format
  image_description: The plot displays a rose chart (polar bar chart) showing monthly
    rainfall data in millimeters. The chart uses a blue color (#306998) for all 12
    segments representing months from January to December. Months are labeled in bold
    around the perimeter, starting from January at the top (12 o'clock position) and
    progressing clockwise. The radial axis shows values from 0 to ~200mm with gridlines
    at 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200. The segment radii correspond to rainfall
    values, with July showing the highest rainfall (~180mm) and February the lowest
    (~72mm). The title reads "Monthly Rainfall (mm) · rose-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The outer ring has a blue border matching the bar color.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3), but no legend present (not strictly needed
          for single-color rose chart, however the chart could benefit from labeling
          what the radius represents)
