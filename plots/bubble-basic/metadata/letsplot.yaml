review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent code quality with clean KISS structure, specific imports, and idiomatic
    lets-plot usage
  - Strong realistic data context (market analysis) with plausible values and visible
    correlation
  - Good use of lets-plot layer_tooltips() with formatted revenue/growth/market-share
    lines — a distinctive feature
  - All font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Proper transparency (alpha=0.6) for handling overlapping bubbles
  weaknesses:
  - Single monochrome blue color scheme lacks visual richness — adding a color dimension
    (e.g., by sector/category) would improve both design excellence and data storytelling
  - No visual hierarchy or emphasis to guide the viewer toward the negative correlation
    story in the data
  - Bubble size range [3, 18] is modest — increasing the range would make the size
    dimension more dramatic and readable
  - The spec recommends area-based scaling for accurate visual perception, but scale_size
    defaults to radius-based scaling
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with approximately 40 blue bubbles
    (#306998) of varying sizes scattered across the canvas. The x-axis shows "Revenue
    (Million USD)" ranging from 10 to 200, and the y-axis shows "Growth Rate (%)"
    ranging from 0 to 30. A size legend titled "Market Share (%)" appears on the right
    side with reference bubbles for values 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. All bubbles share
    the same blue color with alpha transparency (~0.6), revealing overlapping areas.
    The data shows a visible negative correlation — companies with higher revenue
    tend to have lower growth rates. The background uses a minimal theme with light
    gray major grid lines and no minor grid. The title "bubble-basic · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left.
