review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of confidence interval band using polygon fill technique
  - Clear statistical annotations showing equation, R², and r values in a well-styled
    box
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Manual calculation of regression and CI demonstrates understanding
  - Good color contrast between scatter points (blue) and regression line (yellow)
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use plotly express trendline features (px.scatter with trendline="ols")
    which would be more idiomatic
  - Legend positioned in lower-right could overlap with data in some scenarios
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart showing the relationship between
    Advertising Spend (x-axis, in thousands $, ranging from ~5 to 105) and Sales Revenue
    (y-axis, in thousands $, ranging from ~50 to 300). Blue circular markers with
    a dark blue outline represent 80 data points with moderate transparency (~0.65
    alpha). A prominent yellow/gold regression line runs through the data showing
    a strong positive linear relationship. A light blue semi-transparent confidence
    interval band surrounds the regression line. The title "scatter-regression-linear
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. An annotation box in the upper-left
    corner displays the regression equation (y = 2.56x + 26.77), R² = 0.974, and r
    = 0.987. A legend in the lower-right corner shows three items: 95% CI, Data points,
    and Regression (R² = 0.974). The plot uses a clean white template with subtle
    gray gridlines.'
