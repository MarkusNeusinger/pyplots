review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud metaphor with correct spatial arrangement
    (cloud on right, rain on left for vertical orientation)
  - Good use of Altair's layered approach combining violin, boxplot, and strip plot
    layers
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B effectively demonstrates the value of raincloud
    plots over simple boxplots
  - Clean, readable code structure with clear comments explaining each layer
  - Appropriate color scheme with good accessibility
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend lacks a background/border, making it slightly blend with the plot area
  - X-axis labels implemented via manual text marks rather than a proper axis could
    be fragile
  - No tooltips or interactivity despite Altair being an interactive library
  - Minor point overlap in dense regions could benefit from slightly smaller point
    sizes
