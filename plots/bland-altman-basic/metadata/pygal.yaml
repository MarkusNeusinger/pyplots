review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean implementation of mean bias and limits of agreement as separate series with
    meaningful labels
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate data distribution
  - Good color differentiation between measurements, mean line, and LoA boundaries
  - Proper use of ddof=1 for sample standard deviation calculation
  weaknesses:
  - LoA values annotated only in legend, not directly on the plot as text annotations
    (spec requests annotations on the plot)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement analysis comparing
    two blood pressure measurement methods (sphygmomanometers). Blue scatter points
    (50 subjects) show the difference vs. mean of paired measurements. The x-axis
    shows "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" ranging from ~100-155 mmHg. The y-axis shows
    "Difference (Method 1 - Method 2) (mmHg)" ranging from -24 to +24. A solid red
    horizontal line marks the mean bias (-1.7 mmHg), with dashed green (upper: +14.6)
    and purple (lower: -17.9) lines showing the ±1.96 SD limits of agreement. The
    white background has subtle grid lines, and a clean legend at the bottom identifies
    all four series with their values.'
