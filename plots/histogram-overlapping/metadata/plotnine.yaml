review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering
  - Semi-transparent overlapping histograms clearly show distribution differences
    and overlap regions
  - Realistic data scenario (user response times) that demonstrates the plot type
    effectively
  - Good color choices with sufficient contrast between groups
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend order is alphabetical rather than matching the logical data pattern (could
    order by mean response time: Power Users → Regular Users → New Users)'
  image_description: "The plot displays three overlapping histograms showing response\
    \ time distributions (in milliseconds) for three user groups. The x-axis shows\
    \ \"Response Time (ms)\" ranging from approximately 0 to 800ms, and the y-axis\
    \ shows \"Frequency\" ranging from 0 to about 33. Three distinct distributions\
    \ are visible:\n- **Power Users** (yellow): Concentrated around 200ms with the\
    \ tightest distribution\n- **Regular Users** (salmon/coral): Centered around 350ms\
    \ with moderate spread  \n- **New Users** (blue): Centered around 450-500ms with\
    \ the widest spread\n\nThe histograms use semi-transparent fills (alpha ~0.5)\
    \ allowing overlap regions to be clearly visible. A legend labeled \"User Group\"\
    \ is positioned on the right side. The title follows the correct format: \"histogram-overlapping\
    \ · plotnine · pyplots.ai\". The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle grid lines."

        comment: Grid is very subtle (good), but legend shows groups in alphabetical
          order rather than logical order (New→Regular→Power would match the visual
          left-to-right distribution pattern)
