review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation showing diverse distribution shapes (unimodal, bimodal,
    different spreads)
  - Clean, readable code following plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Good color contrast between violin fill (blue) and points (yellow)
  - Appropriate transparency on violin to maintain point visibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Uses geom_jitter instead of a true swarm plot (points spread randomly rather than
    avoiding overlap algorithmically)
  - Grid styling is minimal/absent - could benefit from subtle gridlines for value
    reading
  - Some points extend slightly outside violin boundaries due to jitter width
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally for
    the conditions "Control", "Treatment A", "Treatment B", and "Treatment C" on the
    x-axis. The y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 200 to
    600 ms. Each violin is rendered in a light blue (#306998) with transparency (alpha
    ~0.4), showing the kernel density estimate of the distribution. Yellow/gold jittered
    points (#FFD43B) are overlaid on each violin, representing individual data observations.
    The title "violin-swarm · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The violins
    show distinct distribution shapes: Control has a wide unimodal distribution centered
    around 420-450ms; Treatment A shows a narrower distribution around 370-400ms;
    Treatment B displays a bimodal distribution (visible in the wider, rounder shape)
    spanning 350-630ms; and Treatment C shows a wide distribution with spread from
    210-600ms. The swarm points effectively reveal the individual observations within
    each violin boundary.'
