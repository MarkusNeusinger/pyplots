review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: horizontal orientation, contrasting
    colors, zero baseline indicator, and sorted bars'
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good commenting
  - Value labels at bar ends enhance readability and make the chart immediately informative
  - Proper use of matplotlib-specific features (spines removal, axvline, Patch-based
    legend)
  - Realistic product satisfaction survey scenario with meaningful category names
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include context (e.g., Net Satisfaction Score (%)) to clarify
    the measurement scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing product
    satisfaction survey scores for 12 categories. Blue bars (#306998) extend rightward
    from the zero baseline for positive satisfaction scores (satisfied), while yellow
    bars (#FFD43B) extend leftward for negative scores (dissatisfied). Categories
    are sorted by value from lowest (Mobile App: -52) at the bottom to highest (Brand
    Trust: +85) at the top. Each bar has a bold value label at its end showing the
    score with +/- sign. A clear vertical black line marks the zero baseline. The
    title "bar-diverging · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in
    the lower right explains "Positive (Satisfied)" and "Negative (Dissatisfied)".
    Subtle dashed gridlines appear on the x-axis. The x-axis is labeled "Net Satisfaction
    Score" with range from -100 to +100.'
