review:
  strengths:
  - Creative spiral positioning algorithm for word placement without overlaps
  - Excellent use of Python-themed color palette with good contrast
  - Clear title following the required format
  - Well-balanced layout with words filling the canvas appropriately
  - Good variation in font sizes reflecting frequency differences
  weaknesses:
  - Some smaller words (GraphQL, Terraform, AWS) are slightly hard to read due to
    light colors on white background
  - Word distribution could be more compact - there is empty space at the bottom of
    the canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a word cloud with 25 tech industry buzzwords.
    The largest words "Python", "Data", "Machine", "Learning", "Analytics", and "Cloud"
    dominate the center, with "Python" being the most prominent in dark blue (#306998).
    Words are colored using a palette of dark blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), light
    blue (#4B8BBE), gray (#646464), and variations. Font sizes range from large (Python,
    Data, Machine) to small (GraphQL, AWS, Terraform). The words are arranged in a
    roughly circular/spiral pattern filling the center of the canvas, with the title
    "wordcloud-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top. No axes are present as expected
    for a word cloud. The layout is clean with no overlapping text.

        comment: Uses Altair's mark_text, encoding system, and declarative approach.
          However, word clouds are not Altair's strength - creative solution but not
          showcasing Altair's best features like interactive selections or layered
          charts
  verdict: APPROVED
