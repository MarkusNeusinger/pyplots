review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriately sized nodes and clearly readable character
    labels
  - Arc height correctly proportional to connection distance, demonstrating long vs
    short-range relationships effectively
  - Good use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) handles overlapping arcs gracefully
  - Added legend explaining arc thickness/interaction strength
  - Realistic character interaction scenario that demonstrates the plot type effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper data organization
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis with numeric ticks and Connection Arc Height label is semantically incorrect
    for arc diagrams - arcs are visual encodings not data mapped to y-coordinates;
    axis should be completely hidden
  - Grid lines visible in rendered output add unnecessary visual noise for this abstract
    diagram type
  - Rendered image does not match code axis removal commands - verify sns.set_theme
    style parameter does not override axis removal
