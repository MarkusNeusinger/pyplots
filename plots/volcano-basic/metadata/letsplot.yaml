review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual distinction between significance categories using blue/gray/red color
    coding
  - Proper threshold lines at -log10(0.05) and ±1 fold change as specified
  - Uses lets-plot grammar of graphics effectively with ggplot + geom_point + scale_color_manual
  - Good data generation with realistic volcano plot distribution - appropriate mix
    of significant and non-significant genes
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title says Status instead of Significance for better clarity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a volcano plot with log2 fold change on the
    x-axis (ranging from approximately -3.5 to 3.5) and -log10(p-value) on the y-axis
    (ranging from 0 to 3.6). Points are colored in three categories: blue for down-regulated
    genes (left side, above threshold), gray for non-significant genes (center, mostly
    below threshold), and red for up-regulated genes (right side, above threshold).
    Dashed vertical threshold lines are present at -1 and +1 fold change, and a horizontal
    dashed threshold line at ~1.3 (-log10(0.05)). The title reads "volcano-basic ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" and a legend on the right shows "Status" with Down-regulated
    (blue), Not significant (gray), and Up-regulated (red). The layout is clean with
    good use of whitespace and the minimal theme provides an uncluttered background.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_point, scale_color_manual, theme_minimal,
