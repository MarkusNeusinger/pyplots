review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sigmoid curve representation with clear S-shape transition
  - Good use of custom pygal Style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Realistic credit approval scenario with proper jittering of binary outcomes
  - Clean implementation of gradient descent for logistic regression without external
    dependencies
  - Decision threshold line clearly visible at p=0.5
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval shown as dashed lines rather than semi-transparent shaded
    band (spec preference, though pygal has limited fill capabilities)
  - All blue elements (logistic curve, CI bounds) use same color making them less
    visually distinct
  - Legend uses square markers for all items instead of line symbols for line-based
    elements
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression visualization for credit
    approval based on credit score. It shows a characteristic S-shaped (sigmoid) curve
    in blue representing the fitted logistic model. The x-axis displays "Credit Score"
    ranging from 300 to 850, and the y-axis shows "Probability of Approval" from 0
    to 1. Red dots represent rejected applicants (Class 0), clustered near y=0 with
    jittering, while yellow/gold dots represent approved applicants (Class 1), clustered
    near y=1. Two dashed blue lines show the 95% confidence interval bounds around
    the main curve. A horizontal dashed gray line at y=0.5 indicates the decision
    threshold. The legend at the bottom shows six items: Logistic Fit, 95% CI Upper,
    95% CI Lower, Threshold (p=0.5), Rejected (0), and Approved (1). The title follows
    the correct format: "logistic-regression · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
