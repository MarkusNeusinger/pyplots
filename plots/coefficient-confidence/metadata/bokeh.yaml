review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data context with realistic housing regression scenario
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern
  - Good text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correct horizontal layout for readability with long variable names
  - Variables properly sorted by coefficient magnitude
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain significance color coding (blue vs gray)
  - No HoverTool to display coefficient values and CI bounds on hover (missed Bokeh
    feature opportunity)
  - Color distinction between significant/non-significant could be stronger (consider
    different marker shapes or bolder colors)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot for a housing
    price regression model with 10 predictor variables on the y-axis and standardized
    coefficient estimates on the x-axis. Variables are ordered by absolute coefficient
    magnitude from bottom (Property Tax Rate, smallest) to top (Square Footage, largest).
    Each variable shows a point estimate with horizontal confidence interval bars.
    A vertical dashed gray line marks zero (null hypothesis threshold). The title
    reads "coefficient-confidence · bokeh · pyplots.ai". X-axis is labeled "Coefficient
    Estimate (Standardized)" and y-axis is labeled "Predictor Variable". The background
    is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines. All points appear to be
    rendered in the same blue color (#306998) - the color differentiation between
    significant and non-significant coefficients is not visually apparent in the rendered
    image.
