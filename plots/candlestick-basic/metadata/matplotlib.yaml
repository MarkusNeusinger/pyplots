review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent candlestick implementation with proper anatomy (bodies and wicks clearly
    distinguished)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper data generation
  - Professional appearance with appropriate colors, font sizes, and subtle grid
  - Realistic stock price simulation with proper business day handling
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain green=bullish/red=bearish (helpful for non-financial
    audiences)
  - Wick linewidth (2) could be thinner (1-1.5) relative to body for better visual
    distinction per spec note
