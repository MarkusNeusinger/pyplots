❯ anyplot.ai — design system
─────────────────────────────
brand · frontend · plots — one reference for every adjustment
```

The complete design system for **anyplot.ai** — brand identity, frontend visual language, and plot color system in one document. Use this for any frontend adjustment, content tone decision, or plot styling choice.

The guiding principle throughout: **the website is the neutral frame; the plots are the content.** Every design choice should make room for the data visualizations to do the work — and every interaction should feel native to someone who lives in a terminal or code editor.

---

## 1. TL;DR

anyplot.ai is a considered reference work styled like a code editor over a paper magazine. Three layers, each with a clear role:

| Layer | Role | Anchor |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Brand** | Identity, voice, logo, tone of communication | Lowercase default; `any.plot()` wordmark with green dot |
| **Frontend** | Website visual language: typography, layout, components | Editorial-scientific paper × terminal/code-editor overlay |
| **Plots** | Color palette for every visualization across all 9 libraries | Okabe-Ito 8-color categorical, brand `#009E73` first |

**Aesthetic direction:** `arXiv paper` × `tmux/lazygit` rather than `SaaS dashboard` or `AI startup`. The reader should feel they're browsing a curated journal that happens to live inside a terminal — section headers carry shell prompts (`❯`, `$`, `~/plots/`), hero text types itself with a blinking cursor, action buttons read as method calls (`.copy()`, `.open()`, `.download()`).

**Color discipline:** `#009E73` (Okabe-Ito Bluish Green) appears only in small, deliberate moments — logo dot, italic accents, hover states, active navigation, terminal cursor. Everything else is warm grayscale, so when a chart appears its colors land with full impact.

**Pipeline transparency:** AI is part of the story, not a hidden production detail. Specs are human-written, code is AI-generated, reviews are AI-evaluated, fixes refine specs or AI rules. Communicated openly in copy and methodology pages.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Visual principles (frontend)

**1. Reserve color for moments that earn it.** The Okabe-Ito palette has seven saturated colors. If the website itself uses them liberally — brightly colored buttons, banners, hero backgrounds — the actual plots lose their visual punch. We treat the palette as **precious**: the brand green appears in maybe five to ten places on a given page (logo, one italic headline accent, terminal cursor, primary CTA hover, active nav indicator, a handful of link underlines). Everything else is one of the seven gray tones.

**2. Warmth over clinical.** Pure `#FFFFFF` backgrounds make palette colors look harsh and the layout feel like a banking app. We use a warm off-white (`#F5F3EC`) as the base, with slightly lighter surfaces (`#FAF8F1`) for cards. This gives the page a paper-like quality and makes the saturated plot colors look **intentional** rather than loud. Dark mode mirrors this: `#121210` rather than pure black, with a subtle warm undertone.

**3. Code is the native register.** Section headers carry shell prompts (`❯ libraries`, `$ plots`, `~/anyplot/`), action buttons read as method calls (`.copy()`, `.open()`, `.download()`), the hero headline types itself with a blinking cursor. The site speaks the dialect of its visitors. This is not skinning — it's the framing device. Removing the editorial paper underneath would over-tip into "developer toy"; removing the terminal layer would feel sterile and product-marketing-y. The two layers depend on each other.

**4. Typography carries the editorial weight, mono carries the code weight.** Three fonts with distinct roles:
- **Serif (Fraunces)** — hero headlines and section titles only; the editorial moment
- **Monospace (MonoLisa)** — everything else by default: body text, UI labels, navigation, terminal prompts, buttons, code, logo
- **Sans-serif (Inter)** — rare; only for places where MonoLisa would feel too dense (legal text, long-form blog body, dense data tables)

This is a deliberate inversion of typical sites: mono is the default, serif is the accent.

**5. Generous vertical rhythm.** Section padding is 80px vertical on desktop. Hero sections get 80–100px. Cards have 24–28px internal padding. The layout should feel **unhurried**, like a journal you read cover to cover rather than a dashboard you scan.

**6. Self-evident, not explained.** Buttons should not need labels saying "click here to copy" — they say `.copy()` and that is enough. Icons may exist but are secondary; the primary affordance is text in mono that reads like code. If a coder would understand `df.head()` without help, they will understand `.preview()` on a plot card. Explanation prose belongs in docs, not on the page chrome.

**7. Details reward attention.** Small touches that reward a user who looks closely: the cursor blinks in the hero, the logo dot pulses subtly in the hero-plot legend, active navigation items have a small green dot prefix, the palette strip at the bottom expands the hovered color and contracts the rest, code blocks have `● ● ●` macOS-style header dots in 10% opacity, the side plot stacks scroll lazily on ultrawide. None essential to function — they signal "this was made with care."

### 2.2 Verbal principles (voice)

The brand voice is:

1. **Precise** — we say exactly what we mean, with the right technical terminology
2. **Understated** — we let the work speak; we don't overhype
3. **Curious** — we share interesting details and reasoning, not just conclusions
4. **Respectful of the reader** — we assume technical literacy without being condescending
5. **Slightly playful** — the occasional small joke, mostly structural (the method-call logo, the `import anyplot as ap` alias, comments-as-prose)
6. **Code-native** — when in doubt, write it as code. Pipelines as arrows (`spec → code → review`), state as flags, errors as stderr lines. Prose only where prose actually helps.
7. **AI-honest** — AI generates the code and runs the reviews. We say so plainly. We don't hype it ("AI-powered"), and we don't hide it ("magically generated").

Tone attributes we avoid:
- **Sales-y** — no "unlock", "supercharge", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- **Corporate** — no "solutions", "leverage", "empower", "synergies"
- **Breathless** — no excessive exclamation marks, no "literally" or "amazing"
- **AI-hype** — no "powered by AI", "intelligent", "smart" — but we *do* describe what the AI actually does
- **Emoji-heavy** — avoid emojis in documentation and formal writing

---

## 3. Brand Identity

### 3.1 Name & Pronunciation

**anyplot.ai** carries three ideas:

- **"any"** — library-agnostic. Not "py" because the project's long-term vision extends beyond one language.
- **"plot"** — the core object. We're not abstracting away the plot; we're cataloguing it.
- **".ai"** — the modern TLD, inherited from `pyplots.ai`. Signals "contemporary technical project" without claiming AI-generated content.

**Pronunciation:** "any-plot dot AI" — three distinct words, not "any-plottie". The dot is pronounced because the domain structure matters.

Alternative casual forms:
- "anyplot" (when domain isn't needed)
- "ap" (in code: `import anyplot as ap`)

**Relationship to pyplots.ai:** `pyplots.ai` is the predecessor. The rebrand is communicated as evolution, not replacement: "anyplot.ai is the next chapter of pyplots.ai — broader in scope (beyond Python), broader in language (beyond English), and anchored in a colorblind-safe palette that travels across every library."

### 3.2 Logo

The logo is typographic, rendered in MonoLisa Bold:

```
any.plot()
```

Specifically:

- `any` in `--ink` (near-black on light, near-white on dark)
- `.` in `--ok-green` (`#009E73`), scaled to 145% with 2–3px horizontal margin
- `plot` in `--ink`
- `()` in `--ink` at 45% opacity, normal weight (not bold)

The `.` is the single most important brand element. It is:

- The method-call operator, signaling "this is code"
- A data point, the atomic unit of a plot
- The color anchor (the one place brand green always appears)

All three readings are intentional.

**Geometry:**

```
letter-spacing: -0.02em  (slight negative tracking for density)
font-weight:    700 (bold) for letters, 400 (regular) for parens
```

**Sizes:**

| Context           | Size       | Notes                           |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Favicon / app icon| 16–64px   | Reduce to `a.p` — keeps the dot |
| Top-nav           | 18–22px   | Standard use                    |
| Hero section      | 40–64px   | Occasional, paired with headline|
| Large display     | 80–96px+  | Landing hero, posters           |

**Color variants:**

- **On light background**: ink-dark letters, green dot — default
- **On dark background**: ink-light letters, green dot stays the same
- **On brand green background**: do not use — too little contrast. Use monochrome white version instead.
- **Monochrome**: all letters in `--ink`, dot also in `--ink`. Used in print, fax-friendly contexts, and the occasional t-shirt.

**What the logo is not:** not an illustration, icon, or mascot. We don't have a plot-graph silhouette, a Python-snake variant, or an anthropomorphic data point. The typographic wordmark is the entire brand mark. Resist the urge to add visual flourishes.

**Clear space:** maintain at least `1em` (one letter-height) around the wordmark on all sides. Inside the clear space, no other text, graphics, or UI elements may appear.

### 3.3 Taglines

**Canonical hero block:**

```
any.plot() — any library.

get inspired.
grab the code.
make it yours.
```

The first line (`any.plot() — any library.`) is the wordmark + product proposition in one breath. The three lines below are the user journey, in the imperative, in lowercase, each one standalone. Together they describe exactly what the site is for: discovery → copy → adaptation. Use this hero block on:

- Landing page hero (full block, with terminal box framing and blinking cursor on the last line)
- Meta description (compress to: `any library. get inspired. grab the code. make it yours.`)
- README headline (full block, in a code fence)
- OG card (line 1 in serif, lines 3–5 in mono)

**Short forms:**

- **"any library."** — when only one phrase fits (browser tab title suffix, social bio one-liner)
- **"get inspired. grab the code. make it yours."** — when the wordmark is already shown nearby (e.g., footer subtitle below the logo)

**Alternative taglines for specific contexts:**

- **"a catalogue of scientific plotting"** — editorial framing, when contextualizing the project in academic writing
- **"from anyplot import *"** — code-playful, good for dev-audience posts
- **"plots that everyone can see"** — accessibility-focused, good for technical articles about colorblind safety
- **"specs by humans, code by AI."** — methodology framing, for about/methodology pages

Rotate alternatives as appropriate. The canonical hero block is always the first choice.

**Taglines we explicitly don't use:**

- "the future of data visualization" (overclaim)
- "AI-powered plotting catalogue" (lazy AI-hype framing — say what the AI does, don't sloganize it)
- "plot anything, anywhere, anytime" (cliché, generic)
- "the GitHub of plots" (imitative framing)

### 3.4 Voice & Tone

See §2.2 for the five tone attributes (precise, understated, curious, respectful, slightly playful) and what to avoid.

### 3.5 Capitalization & Punctuation

**Default: lowercase.** UI labels, section titles, taglines, button text — all lowercase unless there's a specific reason.

Reasons to use uppercase:

- Proper nouns (library names like `matplotlib` are lowercase because that's how they're written; `GitHub` is uppercase because that's how it's written — follow upstream conventions)
- First word of a sentence in long-form prose
- Proper names of people or places
- Code identifiers that are uppercase in their original context

The lowercase default matches the code-forward aesthetic and keeps the site feeling quiet.

**Punctuation:**

- **Oxford comma**: yes, always (we write for a technical audience that tends to appreciate grammatical clarity)
- **Em-dashes**: used freely for parenthetical asides — like this — with spaces around them (European style)
- **Sentence structure**: prefer short, declarative sentences. Longer sentences are fine when the content demands it.
- **Questions**: rare. We usually state things rather than ask them.

### 3.6 Voice Examples (do / don't)

**Announcing a new library:**

> Do: `plotnine support just landed. 74 new examples using the grammar of graphics.`
>
> Don't: `🎉 Big news! We're excited to announce that plotnine is now fully supported on anyplot.ai! Check out our awesome new collection of 74 examples! 🚀`

**Error message:**

> Do:
> ```
> $ ap.load("ggplot")
> ✗ unknown library: "ggplot"
>   supported: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, bokeh,
>              altair, plotnine, pygal, highcharts, lets-plot
> ```
>
> Don't: `Oops! Looks like we don't support "ggplot" yet. But don't worry — we're always adding new libraries! 🙂`

**Changelog entry:**

> Do:
> ```
> v0.4.0
> + altair support
> + palette exports accept theme="light"|"dark"
> ~ seaborn examples now include legends (was: omitted)
> ```
>
> Don't: `🎉 v0.4.0 is here! We've been working hard to bring you some amazing new features...`

**GitHub issue response to a feature request:**

> Do: `interesting idea. doesn't fit the catalogue scope right now — anyplot is static examples, this needs interactive features. keeping open for discussion.`
>
> Don't: `Thanks so much for this amazing feature request!! ❤️ We'll definitely consider this for our roadmap!`

**Describing the AI pipeline:**

> Do:
> ```
> // pipeline
> spec    → human-written
> code    → ai-generated
> review  → ai-evaluated
> fix     → spec refined or ai rules tuned
> ```
>
> Don't: `Powered by cutting-edge AI to bring you the best plotting examples!`

**The pattern:** state the mechanism, name what does what, no breathless framing. When in doubt, format as code — pipelines as arrows, results as `+`/`~`/`-`/`✗`.

**Long-form transformation example:**

> Instead of: `🚀 Supercharge your data viz workflow with AI-powered plot generation! Unlock 1000+ beautifully crafted charts across multiple libraries. Ship faster, iterate smarter, and empower your team to create stunning visualizations!`
>
> Write: `A catalogue of 1,000+ plotting examples across nine Python libraries. Specs are written by humans, code is generated and reviewed by AI, and every example uses the same colorblind-safe palette so switching libraries never breaks your color grammar.`

The second version is shorter, says what's actually happening (specs human / code AI), and reads as if written by someone who cares about what they're building.

### 3.7 Positioning

**What anyplot is:**

- A **reference catalogue**, like a cookbook or an atlas. You come for specific examples.
- **Library-agnostic**, showing the same chart types across matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and others.
- **Colorblind-safe by default**. Every example uses the Okabe-Ito palette. This isn't a feature, it's a baseline.
- **Copyable**. Every example is self-contained, with the full code visible and executable.
- **Curated**. We don't aggregate every plot on the internet — we maintain a considered collection.
- **AI-built, human-shaped.** Specs come from humans. Code generation and quality review run on AI. When something doesn't pass review, we either refine the spec or tune the AI rules — never patch generated code by hand. The pipeline is documented and visible.

**What anyplot is not:**

- **A plotting library**. We don't compete with matplotlib or plotly. We help you use them better.
- **An AI plot generator the user prompts.** Users browse a curated catalogue. They don't type prompts; the AI runs offline against specs.
- **A dashboard tool**. We show static examples. Interactive dashboards are a different product category.
- **A tutorial platform**. We assume you know how to run Python code. We don't teach from zero.
- **A community forum**. We accept contributions through GitHub but we're not building a social layer.

### 3.8 Story Points

Narrative hooks for talking about anyplot — adapt to context, don't recite verbatim:

**The pipeline story:** Specs are written by humans, code is generated by AI, every plot is reviewed by AI for visual quality and spec compliance, and when something doesn't pass we refine the spec or the AI rules — never patch the code. That makes anyplot a catalogue that maintains itself: when matplotlib ships a new release, we re-run the pipeline; when a better example pattern emerges, we update the spec and every library regenerates. Humans curate, AI executes.

**The palette story:** Every plot uses the Okabe-Ito palette, peer-reviewed for colorblind safety and designed for scientific publications in 2008. About 8% of men have some form of color vision deficiency — most plotting libraries ignore this entirely. We make it the default.

**The library-agnostic story:** A "Gentoo penguin" is always blue, whether you draw it in matplotlib, plotly, or bokeh. The palette travels with you across libraries. Switching tools doesn't mean re-learning your color grammar.

**The catalogue story:** A thousand examples across nine libraries, each reproducible and copy-pasteable. No ads. No affiliate links. No "suggested tutorials you might like." Just the plots and the code that made them.

**The origin story:** It started as pyplots.ai, a small Python-only catalogue I built in a weekend. It grew when I realized people wanted the same examples across different libraries, and the same safe palette everywhere. anyplot is the grown-up version.

**The personal touch:** Built in Visp, a small town in the Swiss Alps. By a data analyst who spent too many hours trying to figure out why the same chart looked different in seaborn than in plotly.

### 3.9 Naming Conventions

**Library:**
- **Package name**: `anyplot` (lowercase, one word)
- **Import convention**: `import anyplot as ap`
- **Sub-modules**: `anyplot.mpl`, `anyplot.plotly`, `anyplot.bokeh`, etc. — one sub-module per supported library
- **Palettes**: `anyplot.palettes.okabe_ito`, `anyplot.palettes.viridis`, etc.
- **Datasets**: `anyplot.load("penguins")`, `anyplot.load("iris")` — not `load_penguins()`; consistent loader signature

**Domain:**
- **Primary**: `anyplot.ai`
- **Language redirects**: `python.anyplot.ai` → `anyplot.ai/python/`, etc.
- **Documentation**: `docs.anyplot.ai` (planned)

**Examples and identifiers:**
- A **slug** (URL-safe): `matplotlib-scatter-penguins-species`
- A **title** (human-readable): `Scatter plot of penguin species`
- A **library**: one of the nine supported
- **Tags**: chart type, data domain, complexity level

Slugs are the canonical identifier. They're used in URLs, filenames, and `ap.load()` calls.

## 4. Color System

### 4.1 The Okabe-Ito Palette

The Okabe-Ito palette was published in 2008 by Masataka Okabe (Jikei Medical School) and Kei Ito (University of Tokyo) as part of their research on accessible color design for scientific figures. It was optimized empirically for three types of color vision deficiency (CVD) — deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia — which together affect roughly 8% of men and 0.5% of women of Northern European descent.

Three properties make it the right choice for a multi-library plotting catalogue:

**Peer-reviewed and widely trusted.** ggplot2, seaborn, and many scientific R/Python toolkits offer it as a built-in option. Using it means our examples are immediately credible in academic and publication contexts.

**Stable across backgrounds.** Every color has enough luminance contrast to remain distinguishable on both white and near-black backgrounds.

**Eight colors is the right cap.** Research by Ware, Glasbey, and Miller on distinguishable categorical colors converges on 7 ± 2 as the practical limit before viewers start confusing categories.

```python
anyplot_palette = [
    "#009E73",  # 01 · bluish green   ★ brand
    "#D55E00",  # 02 · vermillion
    "#0072B2",  # 03 · blue
    "#CC79A7",  # 04 · reddish purple
    "#E69F00",  # 05 · orange
    "#56B4E9",  # 06 · sky blue
    "#F0E442",  # 07 · yellow
    # 08 · neutral — adaptive: #1A1A1A on light, #E8E8E0 on dark
]
```

**The colors:**

| # | Role          | Hex        | Semantic Use                                                  |
|---|---------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Brand         | `#009E73`  | Logo dot, first category in any plot, primary CTAs            |
| 2 | Secondary     | `#D55E00`  | Second category, warm contrast, warnings                      |
| 3 | Tertiary      | `#0072B2`  | Third category, cool anchor, informational links              |
| 4 | Quaternary    | `#CC79A7`  | Fourth category, soft, distinctive                            |
| 5 | Accent warm   | `#E69F00`  | Fifth category, highlights, hover states                      |
| 6 | Accent cool   | `#56B4E9`  | Sixth category, info states, secondary links                  |
| 7 | Highlight     | `#F0E442`  | Seventh category — use sparingly, poor on white backgrounds   |
| 8 | Neutral       | adaptive   | Text, gridlines, "other", totals                              |

**The adaptive neutral.** Position 8 is not a fixed color but a **role** that switches based on the theme:

- **Light theme** → `#1A1A1A` (near-black, softer than pure `#000`)
- **Dark theme** → `#E8E8E0` (near-white, softer than pure `#FFF`)

This follows the `semantic tokens` pattern used in Apple HIG, Material Design, and GitHub Primer. The first seven colors stay identical across themes so that a category retains its identity; only the neutral flips.

**Order matters.** The color order is **not scientifically prescribed** — the Okabe-Ito paper lists the colors but doesn't mandate a sequence. We've chosen an order optimized for two goals:

1. **Brand consistency.** Position 1 is always `#009E73`. The first data series in every plot is automatically our brand color.
2. **Maximum early contrast.** Positions 1–4 alternate between warm and cool, saturated hues to guarantee maximum distinguishability for plots with few categories. Orange (`#E69F00`) and Yellow (`#F0E442`) — which share the yellow-orange region — are separated by four positions.

```
green → vermillion → blue → purple → orange → sky → yellow → neutral
warm?   warm         cool    warm     warm      cool   warm    neutral
sat.    sat.         sat.    sat.     sat.      soft   soft
```

### 4.2 Surfaces

Plots and content sit inside **surface containers** with consistent styling:

| Surface     | Light          | Dark           | Use                         |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `bg-page`   | `#F5F3EC`      | `#121210`      | Outer page background       |
| `bg-surface`| `#FAF8F1`      | `#1A1A17`      | Cards, plot containers      |
| `bg-elevated`| `#FFFDF6`     | `#242420`      | Modals, tooltips            |

The warm off-white (`#F5F3EC`) is the foundation — pure white would make the saturated palette colors look harsh.

### 4.3 Warm-tinted Grayscale

A warm-tinted grayscale (reddish-brown undertone instead of blue-gray) matches the paper-like background and avoids the "tech blue" feel.

| Token         | Light                       | Dark                          | Role                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `--ink`       | `#1A1A17`                   | `#F0EFE8`                     | Primary text               |
| `--ink-soft`  | `#4A4A44`                   | `#B8B7B0`                     | Secondary text             |
| `--ink-muted` | `#8A8A82`                   | `#6E6D66`                     | Tertiary, meta, labels     |
| `--rule`      | `rgba(26,26,23,0.10)`       | `rgba(240,239,232,0.10)`      | Borders, dividers          |

### 4.4 UI Color Application

`#009E73` (brand green) appears in the UI **only** in these contexts:

1. Logo dot (always)
2. Italic accent words in headlines (e.g., `any library.`)
3. Hero terminal cursor (the blinking `▌` at the end of `make it yours._`)
4. Active navigation item (green dot prefix + underline on hover)
5. Code-style action button hover (`.copy()` → green on hover) and CTA hover (filled background swap)
6. Code block syntax highlighting (strings, specific tokens)
7. Palette strip and any deliberate palette display
8. Small status indicators (pulsing dot in plot-card header)

It does **not** appear in:

- Background colors (never)
- Borders of regular cards (use `--rule` = `rgba(26,26,23,0.10)`)
- Body text emphasis (use serif italic instead)
- Icon colors outside of logos (use gray tones)
- Static (non-cursor, non-status) decorative dots or glyphs

### 4.5 Status Colors

The remaining Okabe-Ito palette colors have reserved UI roles:

- `#D55E00` (Vermillion) — destructive actions, error states
- `#E69F00` (Orange) — "new" badges, hover highlights on secondary elements
- `#0072B2` (Blue) — informational links in prose, footnotes

### 4.6 Plot-only Colors

**Purple (`#CC79A7`), Sky (`#56B4E9`), and Yellow (`#F0E442`) are plot-only and do not appear in the UI at all.** This preserves their visual impact for the data visualizations.

Using them in navigation or buttons breaks the color hierarchy.

## 5. Typography

### 5.1 Font Families

```css
--serif: 'Fraunces', Georgia, serif;
--sans:  'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
--mono:  'MonoLisa', 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;
```

**Loading:**
- **Fraunces**: free, Open Font License. Load via Google Fonts CDN.
- **Inter**: free, Open Font License. Load via Google Fonts CDN or self-host.
- **JetBrains Mono**: free, Open Font License. Fallback for MonoLisa.
- **MonoLisa**: commercial license required. Self-hosted with `@font-face` rules. Licensed per developer — check the license terms before deploying to production. The site should function gracefully if MonoLisa isn't loaded (fallback chain handles this).

### 5.2 Type Roles

The key rule: **mono is the default, serif is the editorial accent, sans is the rare fallback.** Most text on the site is MonoLisa — body, UI, navigation, buttons, labels. Fraunces appears only at hero and section-title moments. Inter is reserved for places where MonoLisa would fatigue (legal text, long-form blog body, dense data tables).

| Element                | Font    | Size                       | Weight | Notes                                                       |

### 5.3 Display Type Construction

The hero block sits inside a terminal-style box (see §7.1) and is built from four typographic layers:

```
┌─ ~/anyplot ──────────────────────┐
│                                  │
│ ❯ any.plot() — any library.      │  ← line 1: mono prompt + wordmark + em-dash + serif italic accent
│                                  │
│ get inspired.                    │  ← lines 3–5: mono lowercase, large weight 500
│ grab the code.                   │
│ make it yours._▌                 │  ← line 5 ends with blinking cursor (see §8.2)
│                                  │
│ [.start()]  [.browse()]          │  ← line 7: code-style action buttons (see §7.4)
│                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Line 1 construction:**
- `❯ ` — MonoLisa, weight 500, color `--ink-muted`, scaled to 0.7× line-height
- `any.plot()` — MonoLisa Bold, color `--ink`, with `.` in `--ok-green` scaled 1.45×
- ` — ` — em-dash with surrounding spaces, MonoLisa, color `--ink-muted`
- `any library.` — Fraunces italic, weight 300, color `--ok-green`

**Lines 3–5 construction (the user-journey triplet):**
- MonoLisa, weight 500, color `--ink`
- Each line is a complete sentence ending in `.`, lowercase
- Last line ends with `_` (underscore) followed by a `▌` (block cursor) that blinks (see animation §8.2)

CSS sketch:

```css
.hero {
  font-family: var(--mono);
  font-size: clamp(20px, 2.2vw, 32px);
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: var(--ink);
}
.hero .prompt    { color: var(--ink-muted); margin-right: 0.4em; }
.hero .wordmark  { font-weight: 700; }
.hero .wordmark .dot { color: var(--ok-green); display: inline-block; transform: scale(1.45); }
.hero .accent    { font-family: var(--serif); font-style: italic; font-weight: 300; color: var(--ok-green); }
.hero .triplet   { margin-top: 1.5em; font-weight: 500; }
.hero .cursor    { display: inline-block; width: 0.6em; background: var(--ok-green); animation: blink 1s steps(2) infinite; }
@keyframes blink { 50% { opacity: 0; } }
```

**Stat/numeral display construction (used for big counts on landing/about):**
- Number in Fraunces 56px weight 300, with the most striking digit in italic + brand green
- Label below in MonoLisa uppercase 11px tracked `.15em`

### 5.4 Plot-internal Typography

Inside plot containers (axis labels, legends, annotations), use monospace throughout to keep plots consistent with the code-forward brand and align with how readers see plot labels in Jupyter notebooks and documentation.

- **Tick labels, legends, annotations**: MonoLisa or fallback monospace, 10–12px
- **Axis labels**: MonoLisa, 11–13px, `--ink-soft`
- **Plot titles**: MonoLisa, 13–15px, `--ink`, rendered outside the plot in the container header rather than inside the axes

## 6. Layout System

### 6.1 Three-tier Width System

Different page types deserve different widths. The system has three tiers:

| Tier            | Max width  | Used for                                                    |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **paper**       | 1240px     | Landing hero box, About, Methodology, Blog, Legal           |
| **catalog**     | 2200px     | Plot catalog, search results, library pages, spec pages     |
| **hero-flank**  | full vw    | Landing hero side plot stacks (only ≥1600px viewport)       |

**Why three tiers:**

- **paper**: keeps reading line-length comfortable (60–80 chars) for editorial content
- **catalog**: lets ultrawide screens show many plot cards per row (the user came to browse — give them room)
- **hero-flank**: rewards ultrawide users with extra showcase content (vertical scrolling thumbnails) without compressing the paper-width hero

CSS sketch:

```css
.tier-paper   { max-width: 1240px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 var(--gutter); }
.tier-catalog { max-width: 2200px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 var(--gutter); }
.tier-flank   { width: 100vw; }   /* full viewport width, used by hero side stacks only */
```

**Other layout primitives:**

- **Gutter**: 24px on mobile, scaling to 96px on wide screens (set as `--gutter`)
- **Hero box**: paper-tier, terminal-style box (see §7.1) ~700–900px wide inside the paper container
- **Library grid (catalog tier)**: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))` — responsive across the full 2200px

### 6.2 Spacing & Vertical Rhythm

- **Section padding**: 80px vertical on desktop
- **Hero sections**: 80–100px vertical
- **Card padding**: 24–28px internal

This is significantly more breathing room than most modern sites, and it's deliberate — see principle §2.1.5.

### 6.3 Section Header Pattern

Each section starts with a shell-prompt prefix that names the section as if it were a directory or command. The prompt sits inline with the section title:

```
❯ libraries
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
matplotlib   seaborn   plotly   bokeh   altair   ...

$ plots
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[scatter-basic] [bar-grouped] [line-multi] ...

~/anyplot/about
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

- **Prefix glyph**: `❯` for navigation/categorical sections, `$` for action/list sections, `~/path/` for hierarchical/about/meta sections
- **Prefix font**: MonoLisa weight 500, color `--ink-muted`, scaled to ~0.6× the title size
- **Title font**: Fraunces 1.6–2rem weight 400, optionally with one italic green accent word
- **Underline**: 1px solid `--rule`, full container width, sits 8–12px below the title baseline

The pattern reads as if the user just typed a command and got a section as output. It collapses the editorial "Section §01" framing into something more native to the visitor.

### 6.4 Masthead Rule

The site opens with a thin horizontal rule displaying:

```
~/anyplot · v1 · spring 2026 │ any library. one plot. │ ◐ theme
```

Lowercase, monospace, three sections separated by `│` (U+2502). The `◐` is a half-circle theme toggle. This is a tiny but high-impact element — immediately positions the site as a tool/publication hybrid rather than a marketing page.

### 6.5 Library Grid

In catalog tier (`max-width: 2200px`): `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))`. On a 2200px viewport this yields ~7 cards per row (with default 280px min); on a 1280px viewport, ~4 cards. Responsive without explicit breakpoints.

---

## 7. Components

### 7.1 Hero Terminal Box

The landing hero sits inside a single ASCII-style box drawn with CSS borders. The box framing makes the hero feel like a terminal window and gives the typed-out content a natural container.

```
┌─ ~/anyplot ──────────────────────┐
│                                  │
│ ❯ any.plot() — any library.      │
│                                  │
│ get inspired.                    │
│ grab the code.                   │
│ make it yours._▌                 │
│                                  │
│ [.start()]  [.browse()]          │
│                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

```css
.hero-box {
  position: relative;
  border: 1px solid var(--ink-muted);
  border-radius: 6px;       /* slight, terminal-window-like */
  background: var(--bg-surface);
  padding: 36px 40px 32px;
  font-family: var(--mono);
  max-width: 720px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
.hero-box::before {
  content: "~/anyplot";
  position: absolute;
  top: -0.7em;
  left: 24px;
  padding: 0 10px;
  background: var(--bg-page);    /* punches through the border */
  font-size: 12px;
  color: var(--ink-muted);
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;
}
```

The `::before` pseudo-element ("`~/anyplot`") sits on top of the border line, like a tab label on a tmux pane or a fieldset legend. On dark mode the same construction works because `--bg-page` swaps automatically.

### 7.2 Plot Card

The fundamental display unit for any visualization:

```css
background: var(--bg-surface);
border: 1px solid var(--rule);
border-radius: 12px;
padding: 28px;
box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.02),
            0 24px 48px -24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
```

Two-layer shadow: the first (`0 1px 2px`) gives a sharp edge that keeps the card visually anchored; the second (`0 24px 48px -24px`) is a soft ambient drop that suggests elevation without being heavy.

The card has three vertical zones:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ scatter-basic              ↗ open    │  ← header: mono slug + open-in-new icon
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                      │
│   [ plot SVG area ]                  │
│                                      │
├── dashed rule ──────────────────────┤
│ matplotlib · 120 LOC                 │  ← footer: library + meta in mono-muted
│                                      │
│ .copy()  .open()  .download()        │  ← actions: code-style buttons (see §7.4)
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The dashed rule between plot and footer differentiates the meta from the plot without drawing attention. Solid rules feel too structural for this role.

Action buttons appear on card hover (`opacity: 0 → 1`, 0.2s).

### 7.3 Library Card

Used in the catalogue grid. Similar to plot card but with specific additions:

- Top 2px accent bar, initially `scaleX(0)`, animates to `scaleX(1)` on hover (color varies per library via `--accent` custom property)
- Hover lifts card by 3px (`translateY`) and softens border toward brand green
- Mini-plot thumbnail uses SVG at fixed 120px height
- Library name in mono-bold, example count in mono-muted (`matplotlib · 142 plots`)

The color of the accent bar is a subtle way to give each library a personality without breaking the shared palette system — every library gets one of the Okabe-Ito colors as its accent.

### 7.4 Buttons

Three variants. All buttons read as method calls in mono — there is no ambiguity about what they do, and they don't need icons or tooltips to explain themselves.

**Action buttons (code-style — primary affordance throughout the site)**

```css
.btn-action {
  font-family: var(--mono);
  font-size: 13px;
  font-weight: 500;
  color: var(--ink-muted);
  background: transparent;
  border: none;
  padding: 6px 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  letter-spacing: -0.01em;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: color 0.2s, background 0.2s;
}
.btn-action::before { content: "."; color: var(--ink-muted); }
.btn-action:hover {
  color: var(--ok-green);
  background: var(--bg-elevated);
}
.btn-action:hover::before { color: var(--ok-green); }
```

Examples: `.copy()`, `.open()`, `.download()`, `.preview()`, `.share()`, `.fork()`. The leading `.` is part of the visual language — it signals "this is a method on the thing in front of you" without saying so. No icons needed for common actions.

**Hero CTA (filled, only on landing hero)**

```css
.btn-cta {
  font-family: var(--mono);
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 500;
  background: var(--ink);
  color: var(--bg-page);
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 10px 16px;
  transition: background 0.2s, color 0.2s;
}
.btn-cta::before { content: "."; opacity: 0.6; }
.btn-cta:hover {
  background: var(--ok-green);
  color: #FFF;
}
.btn-cta:hover::before { opacity: 1; }
```

Used for `[.start()]` and `[.browse()]` in the hero box. Pill shape replaced with a more terminal-native rectangle (4px radius). Dark-to-green hover transition stays as the signature moment.

**Ghost (rare — only when a primary already occupies visual space)**

```css
.btn-ghost {
  font-family: var(--mono);
  font-size: 13px;
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--ink);
  border: 1px solid var(--rule);
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 14px;
}
.btn-ghost:hover { border-color: var(--ink-muted); }
```

### 7.5 Side Plot Stacks (Ultrawide Hero)

The two vertical strips of plot thumbnails flanking the hero on ultrawide viewports. See §8.5 for the auto-scroll animation and viewport gating.

Container:

```css
.hero-flank {
  display: none;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0; bottom: 0;
  width: clamp(180px, 18vw, 320px);
  overflow: hidden;
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, black 10%, black 90%, transparent);
}
.hero-flank--left  { left: 0; }
.hero-flank--right { right: 0; }
@media (min-width: 1600px) { .hero-flank { display: block; } }
```

Each thumbnail in the stack:
- 1:1 aspect ratio, 12px border-radius
- Static plot image (PNG/SVG), no axes, no labels — pure visual
- Dimmed by default (`opacity: 0.5`), full opacity on hover
- Click navigates to the plot's spec page

### 7.6 Code Block

Dark block, even in light mode. The reasoning: code is "different material" — like a photograph inside a magazine. Forcing it to be light-on-light would make it blend into the surrounding text and lose its "this is code" signal.

```css
background: #0E0E0C;
color: #E8E8E0;
border-radius: 12px;
padding: 28px 32px;
font: 14px/1.7 var(--mono);
box-shadow: 0 24px 48px -16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
```

The fake macOS window-controls (`● ● ●` in 10% opacity) are rendered via a `::before` pseudo-element at the top-left. Playful but not distracting. They also subtly communicate "this is a screenshot of real code running somewhere" which fits the developer-tool framing.

**Syntax highlighting** uses the Okabe-Ito palette:

- Keywords → sky blue
- Strings → brand green
- Function names → orange
- Comments → gray (`#666`, italic)
- Variables → purple
- Numbers → yellow (rare, because the cold Yellow works fine on dark bg)

### 7.7 Navigation

Horizontal text links, no icons, no boxes. On hover, a 1px green underline animates in from the left. On active state, a small green bullet (`•`) appears 12px to the left of the text.

```css
.nav a { position: relative; }
.nav a::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
  height: 1px;
  background: var(--ok-green);
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left;
  transition: transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
.nav a:hover::after { transform: scaleX(1); }
```

The `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` is the standard material-motion "ease-in-out" curve — smooth but with enough snap to feel crisp.

### 7.8 Search Affordance

Top-right of the nav, styled as an inline mono input that reads `❯ .find(_)` with a `⌘K` hint badge to its right. Borderless until hover. Clicking opens a command palette which expands the cursor and accepts typing — the user feels they're continuing the same line of code.

```
❯ .find(_▌)        ⌘K
```

Active palette state replaces the placeholder cursor with the user's typed query, still in mono. Results appear below the input as a list of `slug · library · tags` lines, each prefixed with `❯` to maintain the prompt continuity.

---

## 8. Animation

Restrained. Five categories.

### 8.1 Page Load

Hero box rises from 8px below with opacity transition:

```css
@keyframes rise {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(8px); }
  to   { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
```

Staggered via `animation-delay`:

- Terminal box border: 0s
- Hero line 1 (prompt + wordmark + accent): 0.1s
- Triplet line 1 (`get inspired.`): 0.4s
- Triplet line 2 (`grab the code.`): 0.5s
- Triplet line 3 (`make it yours._▌`): 0.6s
- Action buttons: 0.8s
- Side plot stacks (ultrawide only): 0.4s

Total sequence: ~1.0s. Slightly longer than typical because the staggered triplet is part of the hero's "code typing itself out" feel.

### 8.2 Hero Cursor (Blinking)

The block cursor at the end of `make it yours._▌` blinks indefinitely:

```css
.hero .cursor {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 0.6em;
  height: 1em;
  background: var(--ok-green);
  vertical-align: -0.1em;
  animation: blink 1s steps(2) infinite;
}
@keyframes blink { 50% { opacity: 0; } }
```

Use `steps(2)` rather than a smooth ease — terminal cursors are square-wave, not sinusoidal. A fading cursor reads as decorative; a square-blinking one reads as terminal.

### 8.3 Optional: Hero Typing Animation

For the page-load sequence, the triplet lines may type themselves character-by-character at ~40 chars/second, with the cursor following the typed character. Disable on `prefers-reduced-motion` and on subsequent visits (cookie-flag the first visit). If implemented, the staggered delays in §8.1 are replaced by sequential typing completion.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .hero .typed { animation: none !important; }
  .hero .cursor { animation: none; opacity: 1; }
}
```

### 8.4 Hover States

All transitions use 0.15–0.3s with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`. Never use default `ease` — it's too linear for modern motion.

### 8.5 Side Plot Stacks (Ultrawide Hero)

The vertical plot stacks flanking the hero box on ultrawide viewports auto-scroll continuously:

```css
.hero-flank {
  display: none;            /* hidden by default */
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, black 10%, black 90%, transparent);
}
@media (min-width: 1600px) {
  .hero-flank { display: block; }
}
.hero-flank__track {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 16px;
  animation: flank-scroll 60s linear infinite;
}
@keyframes flank-scroll {
  from { transform: translateY(0); }
  to   { transform: translateY(-50%); }    /* track contains plots×2; loops seamlessly */
}
.hero-flank:hover .hero-flank__track { animation-play-state: paused; }
```

- Two stacks, one each side of the hero box
- Each stack: 8–12 plot thumbnails sampled randomly from the catalog at page load
- Top/bottom 10% fade to transparent (mask-image) so plots dissolve in/out rather than hard-cutting
- Hover anywhere on a stack pauses the scroll (so the user can click through to a plot)
- Disabled on `prefers-reduced-motion`

### 8.6 Palette Strip Interaction

The palette strip at the bottom responds to hover: normal state is even distribution, `:hover .sw` shrinks all colors to 50%, then `.sw:hover` expands the specific hovered color to 300%. Playful detail that invites interaction without being necessary.

```css
.palette-strip .sw { flex: 1; transition: flex 0.3s; }
.palette-strip:hover .sw { flex: 0.5; }
.palette-strip .sw:hover { flex: 3; }
```

---

## 9. Plot Style

### 9.1 Color Defaults

- **First series = brand color (`#009E73`)**. Always. This is the single most important consistency rule.
- **Neutral (position 8) is reserved** for aggregates, residuals, and reference lines. Don't use it for a normal category unless you've exhausted the other seven.
- **Yellow (`#F0E442`) on white backgrounds** has poor contrast. Use it only for position 7 or later, never for thin lines or small markers.

### 9.2 Non-categorical Data

Okabe-Ito is a **categorical** palette — it's for distinct categories, not ordered or continuous data. For other data types:

- **Sequential (single-variable magnitude)**: use `viridis` or `cividis`. Both are perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe. `cividis` is additionally optimized for print.
- **Diverging (two-sided, midpoint-anchored)**: use `BrBG` (brown-to-bluish-green) from ColorBrewer, or construct one centered on a neutral tone.
- **Heatmaps**: use `viridis` for general-purpose, `Reds`/`Blues` for single-polarity intensity.

Don't reach for Okabe-Ito for these cases — a categorical palette on continuous data produces misleading banding artifacts.

### 9.3 Plot Container Surfaces

Plot containers use `--bg-surface` with a 1px border (`rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` on light, `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` on dark) and 12–24px border-radius depending on context. The subtle elevation differentiates plots from page content without harsh boundaries.

### 9.4 Validation

Every palette change should be validated against:

- **Deuteranopia** (red-green confusion, most common CVD, ~6% of men)
- **Protanopia** (red-weak, ~1% of men)
- **Tritanopia** (blue-yellow confusion, rare but important)

For algorithmic palette generation beyond Okabe-Ito, see Petroff (2021) — a more recent palette optimized with numerical solvers in the CAM02-UCS perceptual color space.

### 9.5 Implementation Reference

The palette is exposed in the Python library as:

```python
import anyplot as ap

# full palette as list
ap.palettes.okabe_ito              # returns list of 8 hex strings

# by role name
ap.palettes.okabe_ito.brand        # "#009E73"
ap.palettes.okabe_ito.vermillion   # "#D55E00"
ap.palettes.okabe_ito.blue         # "#0072B2"
# ...

# theme-aware neutral
ap.palettes.okabe_ito.neutral("light")   # "#1A1A1A"
ap.palettes.okabe_ito.neutral("dark")    # "#E8E8E0"

# as matplotlib cycler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = ap.palettes.okabe_ito.cycler()
```

For CSS:

```css
:root {
  --ap-green:      #009E73;
  --ap-vermillion: #D55E00;
  --ap-blue:       #0072B2;
  --ap-purple:     #CC79A7;
  --ap-orange:     #E69F00;
  --ap-sky:        #56B4E9;
  --ap-yellow:     #F0E442;
  --ap-neutral:    #1A1A1A;  /* adaptive */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root { --ap-neutral: #E8E8E0; }
}
```

## 10. Anti-patterns

### 10.1 Visual

- **Gradients**: especially purple-to-blue SaaS gradients. The palette is categorical; continuous gradients would undermine its logic.
- **Glass morphism / backdrop-blur**: too trendy, breaks the paper metaphor.
- **Tech-startup illustrations**: isometric figures, 3D renders, hand-drawn doodles — all wrong register.
- **Parallax effects or hero videos**: too heavy for a content-first site. Layout should feel instantly complete.
- **Badge-heavy UI**: "NEW!" badges, notification dots, progress indicators competing for attention. Reserve attention for plots.
- **Pure white or pure black backgrounds**: harsh, removes the warmth, makes plots look awkward against them.
- **Branded loading spinners**: a plain loading indicator is fine. A branded animated logo is overkill.
- **Generic stock imagery**: no isometric illustrations, no people high-fiving, no laptop-on-desk hero shots. Plots are our imagery.
- **Fonts beyond the three chosen**: no Space Grotesk, no Poppins, no Inter Tight, no experiments with IBM Plex Serif. Three fonts is the system.

### 10.2 Brand

- **Overclaiming**: "The best plotting catalogue." We're not. We're a plotting catalogue. Let readers decide if it's best.
- **Tech-hype vocabulary**: "Supercharge", "unlock", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "AI-powered." All out.
- **Fake urgency**: "Don't miss out!" "Get started today!" — we're not selling anything.
- **Inconsistent casing**: headings that alternate between Title Case and lowercase within the same context look like nobody decided.
- **Testimonials from non-existent users**: we don't need social proof theatre.
- **Cookie banners beyond what's legally required**: we don't track users. The privacy footer says so.

### 10.3 Color

- **Purple (`#CC79A7`), Sky (`#56B4E9`), or Yellow (`#F0E442`) in UI chrome.** These are plot-only colors. Using them in navigation or buttons breaks the color hierarchy.
- **Brand green in backgrounds, body text emphasis, or non-logo icons.** Reserve `#009E73` for the seven approved contexts (§4.4).
- **Categorical palettes on continuous data.** Use viridis/cividis/BrBG instead — see §9.2.

## 11. Reference Files & Implementation

The design system is implemented across:

- **HTML reference (full mockup)**: `mockups/landing.html` — single-file reference with all sections, SVG plots, and animations
- **Theme tokens (frontend)**: `app/src/theme/index.ts` and `app/src/main.tsx` — MUI theme exports for colors, typography, spacing, headingStyle, subheadingStyle, textStyle, tableStyle, codeBlockStyle
- **Palette (Python library)**: `anyplot.palettes.okabe_ito` — see §9.5

**Reference CSS skeleton:**

## 12. Channels & Voice Adaptation

**Website.** Voice as described in §3.4–3.6 — precise, understated, lowercase default. The landing page reads more like a journal essay than a product pitch.

**GitHub README.** Slightly more technical. Use lowercase headings for a consistent feel. Include: logo at top (SVG), one-paragraph description, installation instructions (first thing below the description), quick-start code example, link to documentation, license and citation. Do not include badges for every CI status; that's noise. Only include badges that carry real information.

**Documentation (docs.anyplot.ai).** More formal than the marketing site. Follow the same visual style but with denser information layouts. Code blocks dominate. Each function has: one-line description, parameters table, at least one example, related functions (see-also).

**Social media.** Rare. We're not a company that needs to post daily. Use social channels for: announcing new library support, pointing to particularly interesting examples, linking to related technical writing. Tone: informational, not promotional. Include a plot image whenever possible. Avoid self-reference ("check out our new...") — state the thing itself ("matplotlib now supports...").

**Academic citation:**

```
anyplot.ai. (2026). A catalogue of Python plotting examples
across multiple libraries. https://anyplot.ai
```

Eventually, once the project is mature, consider writing a JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software) paper so there's a formal citation target.

**Non-web visual identity:**

- **GitHub profile images**: square variant of the logo: `any.plot()` in MonoLisa Bold, centered, on warm off-white background (`#F5F3EC`). Green dot at `#009E73`. Maintain 1em padding from edges.
- **OG / Twitter card images**: 1200×630px. Top-left: `anyplot.ai` logo. Center-left: page title in Fraunces serif, italic accent on one word. Center-right: representative plot screenshot or palette strip. Bottom: minimal meta in mono.
- **Presentations**: black or warm off-white backgrounds. Sans-serif (Inter or MonoLisa) body. Fraunces for section dividers. Brand green only for emphasis. Every plot in the deck uses Okabe-Ito.
- **T-shirts / merch (if ever)**: dark t-shirt, `any.plot()` in white with green dot, centered on chest. No taglines, no URLs, no GitHub handles. One variant only.

## 13. Reference Points

Aesthetic directions we drew from:

- **observablehq.com** — scientific, plot-centered, monospace details
- **arXiv preprints** — the "considered paper" feel we're targeting
- **Wes Anderson film posters** — for the principle of warm neutrals with sparing, saturated color accents
- **The New York Times' interactive features** — for the editorial layout rhythm
- **Vercel's documentation** — for the clean monospace-heavy technical pages

What we explicitly didn't borrow from:

- Generic SaaS landing pages (Stripe, Linear, Notion)
- AI startup aesthetics (Anthropic site, OpenAI site, HuggingFace)
- Tech-product marketing pages (Vercel's homepage, specifically — too dense with features)

## Maintenance

This document is the canonical design system reference. Deviations should be discussed and either:

1. Rejected (system holds)
2. Accepted as one-off exceptions (documented inline in code with a comment)
3. Accepted as new standards (this document is updated)

Option 3 is the healthy path for small refinements. This is a living document, not a contract.
