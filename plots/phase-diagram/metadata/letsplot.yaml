review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of damped harmonic oscillator phase space with clear spiral
    convergence to equilibrium
  - Multiple trajectories from different initial conditions effectively demonstrate
    basin of attraction concept
  - Fixed point clearly marked with distinctive red X marker
  - Starting points clearly marked with hollow circles with stroke, making trajectory
    origins easy to identify
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate color palette and readable text at
    all sizes
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics (ggplot, geom_path, aes mappings)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entries show raw initial condition tuples; more descriptive labels would
    improve readability
  - Inner spiral loops become slightly dense near equilibrium; direction arrows could
    show time evolution more clearly
  image_description: The plot displays a phase diagram (state space plot) showing
    four spiral trajectories converging to a fixed point at the origin. The trajectories
    are colored in blue, yellow, green, and purple, each starting from different initial
    conditions marked with hollow circle markers. The fixed point (equilibrium) at
    the origin is marked with a bold red "X". The x-axis is labeled "Position (x)"
    ranging from approximately -2.5 to 3, and the y-axis is labeled "Velocity (dx/dt)"
    ranging from approximately -6 to 5. The title "phase-diagram · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend on the right side shows "Starting Condition" with
    four entries corresponding to each trajectory's initial (x, v) values. The plot
    has a clean minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, geom_path for trajectories, geom_point with
          shape/stroke for markers, scale_color_manual, theme_minimal with customization;
          could leverage more lets-plot specific interactive features
  verdict: APPROVED
