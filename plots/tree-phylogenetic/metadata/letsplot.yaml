review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of rectangular phylogenetic tree using lets-plot grammar
    of graphics
  - Custom Newick parser handles complex nested structure correctly
  - Color-coded clades (great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys) add visual interest
  - Branch lengths accurately reflect evolutionary distances with proportional x-axis
    positioning
  - Clean tree layout with horizontal and vertical segments properly connected
  - Good use of theme_minimal with customized axis and grid settings
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the three clade color groups (blue/yellow/green)
  - No scale bar to indicate branch length units
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phylogenetic tree (rectangular cladogram
    layout) showing primate evolutionary relationships. The tree has a blue color
    scheme (#306998) for branches and nodes, with leaf nodes color-coded by clade:
    blue for great apes (Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla), yellow for lesser apes (Orangutan,
    Gibbon), and green for Old World monkeys (Macaque, Baboon, Mandrill). The x-axis
    shows "Evolutionary Distance (substitutions per site)" ranging from 0 to 0.85.
    Species labels appear to the right of each leaf node. The title reads "Primate
    Evolution · tree-phylogenetic · letsplot · pyplots.ai". Layout is horizontal with
    good use of canvas space.'
