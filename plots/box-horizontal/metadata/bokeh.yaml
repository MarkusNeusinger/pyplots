review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal box plot implementation with all statistical elements (median,
    quartiles, whiskers, outliers)
  - Categories sorted by median value for easy comparison as suggested in spec
  - Realistic service response time scenario with appropriate variation across categories
  - Clean color scheme with good contrast (blue boxes, yellow median lines)
  - Proper use of bokeh hbar for horizontal orientation
  weaknesses:
  - Code does not use ColumnDataSource which is the idiomatic bokeh way to handle
    data
  - Median line implementation uses a narrow hbar with fixed width which may not scale
    well with different data ranges
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal box plot showing response times
    (ms) for 5 different service types: Cache Layer, API Gateway, Authentication,
    Database Query, and File Storage. The boxes are rendered in a steel blue color
    (#306998) with bright yellow median lines. Categories are listed on the y-axis
    (Service Type) and response times on the x-axis (0-300+ ms). Each box shows the
    IQR with whiskers extending to the data range, and outliers are displayed as hollow
    circles with blue outlines. The plot has a light gray background (#fafafa) with
    subtle dashed grid lines. Categories are sorted by median response time from fastest
    (Cache Layer ~15ms) to slowest (File Storage ~200ms). The title "box-horizontal
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left.'
