review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GridSpec layout with main panel spanning 2 rows and 2 columns, demonstrating
    the core spec feature
  - Professional financial dashboard aesthetic with consistent color scheme (Python
    blue/yellow)
  - 'Good use of matplotlib-specific features: GridSpec with height_ratios, fill_between,
    mdates formatting'
  - All text is clearly legible with appropriate font sizes
  - Realistic financial data scenario with time series, volume, returns distribution,
    and summary statistics
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom row subplots appear slightly cramped compared to the main panel proportions
  - Library features score could be improved by using shared axes between related
    plots (e.g., dates) or constrained_layout
  image_description: The plot displays a 6-panel financial dashboard layout using
    matplotlib's GridSpec. The main plot (spanning 2 columns and 2 rows in top-left)
    shows a blue price trend line with light blue fill below, featuring dates (Jan-May)
    on x-axis and price ($70-$110) on y-axis. Top-right shows a correlation scatter
    plot with yellow markers (blue edges) plotting Variable X vs Variable Y. Middle-right
    displays a "Performance" bar chart with alternating blue/yellow bars for products
    A-D with value annotations (85, 72, 93, 67). Bottom-left shows a "Daily Volume"
    bar chart in blue. Bottom-center shows a "Return Distribution" histogram in yellow
    with blue edges and a dashed vertical line at 0. Bottom-right contains a "Summary
    Stats" text box with monospace statistics on a light blue background. The overall
    title "subplot-grid-custom · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Color
    scheme uses Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B).
