review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the 100% stacked area visualization matching spec requirements
    perfectly
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Colorblind-friendly color palette with good contrast between adjacent areas
  - White edge lines between areas enhance visual clarity
  - Realistic market share scenario with meaningful trends showing composition changes
  - Perfect title format and appropriate font sizes throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Legend slightly overlaps the data area at the top right - could be positioned
    outside the plot area
  - X-axis label Year is generic - could be more descriptive like Year (2015-2024)
  - Library features could be enhanced with annotations showing key percentages or
    trend indicators
