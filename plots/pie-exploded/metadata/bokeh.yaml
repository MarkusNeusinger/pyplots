review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of exploded pie chart using Bokeh wedge glyph with manual
    offset calculation
  - Excellent color palette using Python blue as primary with colorblind-safe secondary
    colors
  - Well-formatted legend with percentages included in labels
  - Proper use of square format (3600x3600) for pie chart
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Percentage labels are well-positioned inside slices with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned slightly far from the chart, leaving some empty space on
    the right
  - Only one slice is exploded; spec mentions 1-3 slices could be exploded for demonstration
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance the interactive HTML output with tooltips
