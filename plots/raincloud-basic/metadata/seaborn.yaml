review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud above, box on baseline, rain below — matches
    the visual metaphor perfectly
  - Bimodal Treatment B distribution effectively demonstrates the advantage of raincloud
    plots over simple box plots
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between blue, yellow, and
    green
  - Explicit font sizing throughout ensures readability at target resolution
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with good use of seaborn modern
    API
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the bimodal distribution in Treatment B is the most interesting
    finding but has no annotation or callout to guide the viewer'
  - No visual emphasis or narrative — the plot displays data without interpretation
  - Box plot whisker and cap colors are all black rather than matching category colors,
    reducing visual cohesion
  - The violin clipping approach via direct vertex manipulation is fragile and could
    break with different seaborn versions
  - Some wasted vertical space in the layout
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction Time
    (ms) on the x-axis ranging from approximately 280 to 580 ms. Each condition features
    three layered elements: (1) a filled half-violin ("cloud") extending above the
    category baseline showing distribution shape, (2) a narrow white box plot with
    black edges centered on the baseline showing median and quartiles, and (3) jittered
    scatter points ("rain") below the baseline showing individual observations. Colors
    are dark blue (#306998) for Control, golden yellow (#E6A800) for Treatment A,
    and green (#4DAF4A) for Treatment B. The Treatment B cloud clearly reveals a bimodal
    distribution with two visible humps around 350ms and 480ms. Rain points have white
    edge highlights and moderate transparency (alpha=0.6). The title reads "raincloud-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in large font at the top. Dashed grid lines appear on
    the x-axis, and top/right spines are removed. The layout fills the 16:9 canvas
    reasonably well with some extra vertical space at top and bottom.'
