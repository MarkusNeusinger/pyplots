review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of custom subplot grid with colspan specification
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial dashboard scenario with coherent data story
  - Proper title format and good use of Python blue/yellow color scheme
  - All subplots have clear, descriptive titles and axis labels with units
  - Good use of plotly make_subplots with specs parameter for non-uniform grid
  weaknesses:
  - No rowspan demonstration (spec mentions both colspan AND rowspan)
  - Grid lines not visible (could add subtle grid for better readability)
  - Scatter plot markers could be slightly larger for the data density (50 points)
