review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of quadratic bezier curves for smooth arcs with height
    proportional to node distance
  - Effective use of ColumnDataSource for data management and custom Legend with LegendItem
    for clear categorization
  - Clean, realistic data scenario (character interactions) that demonstrates the
    plot type well
  - Proper use of semi-transparency (alpha 0.5-0.7) to handle overlapping arcs
  - Correct title format and comprehensive styling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows numeric tick marks (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) which are redundant since
    character names are already labeled below nodes
  - Could add HoverTool to show edge details on hover, leveraging Bokeh interactive
    capabilities
