review:
  strengths:
  - 'Clean, professional visualization with appropriate pyplots color scheme (#306998
    blue, #FFD43B yellow)'
  - Correct lift curve implementation showing model performance vs baseline
  - Excellent realistic data scenario (customer response prediction) that matches
    spec applications
  - Good use of pygal style customization with custom Style configuration
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas size with appropriately scaled fonts
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output leveraging pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Legend font appears relatively small compared to axis labels
  - Missing value annotations at key decile points as suggested in spec
  - Does not fully leverage pygal interactive tooltip features
