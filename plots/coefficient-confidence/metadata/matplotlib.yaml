review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the coefficient plot specification with all required
    features
  - Clean visual design with proper colorblind-safe color scheme
  - Professional use of different markers (circles vs squares) to distinguish significance
  - Variables properly sorted by coefficient magnitude as specified
  - Good use of matplotlib errorbar function with comprehensive styling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend marker edge colors (white) blend slightly with white legend background
  - Data context could be slightly more specific (e.g., actual variable units in context)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a coefficient plot with 10 housing price regression
    predictors arranged vertically on the y-axis (from bottom to top: Distance to
    City Center, Crime Rate Index, Has Pool, Year Built, Garage Spaces, Number of
    Bedrooms, Lot Size (acres), School Rating, Number of Bathrooms, Square Footage).
    Each coefficient is shown as a point with horizontal error bars representing 95%
    confidence intervals. A prominent yellow/gold vertical reference line at x=0 indicates
    the null hypothesis threshold. Significant coefficients (where CIs do not cross
    zero) are shown as blue circles, while non-significant coefficients are shown
    as gray squares. The x-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)" ranging
    from approximately -0.4 to 0.6. A legend in the lower right distinguishes "Significant
    (p < 0.05)" (blue circle) from "Not Significant" (gray square). The title uses
    the correct format "coefficient-confidence · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The layout
    is clean with the plot filling most of the canvas, subtle grid lines on the x-axis
    only, and top/right spines removed for a cleaner look.'
