review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper LOWESS curve clearly visible and distinct from
    scatter points
  - Excellent color contrast between blue data points and yellow LOWESS curve (colorblind-safe)
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern
  - Good use of statsmodels LOWESS with appropriate frac=0.35 parameter
  - Legend clearly indicates the smoothing parameter value
  - Scatter points have appropriate sizing and opacity for 150 data points
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than domain-specific with units
  - Data scenario is synthetic rather than representing a realistic application (e.g.,
    dose-response, economic trend)
  - Font sizes could be slightly increased for better legibility at full resolution
