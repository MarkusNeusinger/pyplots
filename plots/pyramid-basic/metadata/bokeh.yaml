review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent pyramid visualization with clear symmetric layout
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Well-styled text sizes appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Subtle dashed grid styling enhances readability
  - Center line at x=0 provides good visual reference
  - HTML output generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned far from the data in top right corner
  - Could add HoverTool for enhanced interactivity showing exact values
  - Center line implementation uses hardcoded y-range that may not adapt well
