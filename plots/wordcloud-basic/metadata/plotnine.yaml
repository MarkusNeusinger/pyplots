review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of concentric ring layout algorithm for word placement
  - Appropriate color scheme with Python Blue highlighting high-frequency terms
  - Title follows required format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  - Clean KISS code structure with imports, data, plot, save pattern
  - Realistic technology survey context with plausible word frequencies
  weaknesses:
  - Significant word overlap in center row - Learning and Cloud overlap substantially,
    DevOps partially overlapped
  - Low-frequency words on outer edges are too small to read clearly (AWS, Azure,
    Docker, Agile, etc.)
  - Word size range (10-36pt) is too narrow - highest frequency words should be larger
    for visual impact
  - Layout leaves significant empty space at top and bottom while center is crowded
