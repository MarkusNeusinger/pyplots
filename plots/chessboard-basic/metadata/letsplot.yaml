review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with perfect 1:1 aspect ratio and high contrast colors
  - Correct chess board orientation with light square at h1
  - Clean, professional styling with minimal chrome
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar of graphics
  - Proper handling of discrete scales for columns and rows
  weaknesses:
  - The shutil/os file moving workaround adds complexity (lets-plot saves to subdirectory)
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features (hover tooltips showing square names)
  image_description: The plot displays a classic 8x8 chess board visualization using
    lets-plot's geom_tile. The board features alternating cream (#F5DEB3) and brown
    (#8B4513) squares with subtle brown borders (#5D4037) providing definition between
    tiles. Column labels (a-h) appear at the bottom in bold 20pt text, and row labels
    (1-8) appear on the left side in matching style. The title "chessboard-basic ·
    letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold 24pt font. The light square
    is correctly positioned at h1 (bottom-right corner), following standard chess
    board orientation. The board maintains a perfect 1:1 aspect ratio with a clean,
    minimal appearance - no grid lines, no legend, and a transparent background.
