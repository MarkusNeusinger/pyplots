review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of arc diagram with proportional arc heights based
    on node distance
  - Clean use of semi-transparency (0.6 opacity) for overlapping arcs improves readability
  - Good color scheme with high contrast between nodes (yellow) and arcs (blue)
  - Proper use of weight-based line widths to distinguish connection strength
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has excessive whitespace below the baseline that could be reduced by adjusting
    y-axis range
  - Could add hover information showing connection details (source, target, weight)
    for better interactivity
  - Missing edge color coding by type or weight as suggested in spec notes
