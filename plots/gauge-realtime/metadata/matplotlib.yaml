review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of motion trail effect using ghost needles with progressive
    alpha
  - Professional dark theme dashboard aesthetic
  - All specification requirements met including LIVE indicator and motion blur effect
  - Clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic CPU usage monitoring scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme may not be optimal for colorblind users (consider using
    blue instead of green)
  - Could leverage matplotlib polar projection for more elegant arc handling
  - Tick label font size could be slightly larger for better readability at small
    scales
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circular gauge chart on a dark navy background
    (#1A252F). The gauge arc spans 270 degrees from lower-left to lower-right through
    the top. Three color zones are clearly visible: green (0-50), yellow (50-80),
    and red (80-100). The current value of 72% is displayed prominently in large white
    bold text at the center, with "CPU Usage" as a subtitle below it. A red/white
    needle points to the 72 position, and three ghost needles with increasing opacity
    (showing values 65, 68, 70) create a motion trail effect demonstrating real-time
    updates. A red "LIVE" indicator badge with a dot is positioned above the value
    display. White tick marks appear at every 10 units, with numeric labels at 0,
    20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. The title "gauge-realtime · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in white. The overall design is polished with a modern dashboard
    aesthetic.'
