review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and depth perception
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper sizing (4800x2700 via
    scale=3)
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labeling
  - Smooth 40x40 grid provides good surface detail without jagged edges
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated, showcasing Plotly dual-format capability
  - Well-configured camera angle showing the surface from an informative perspective
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis) rather than contextual
  - Layout has more whitespace than optimal; surface could fill more of the canvas
  - np.random.seed(42) is included but unnecessary since the data generation is deterministic
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D surface visualization with the title "surface-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The surface shows a smooth mathematical
    function with peaks (yellow, ~1.3) and valleys (purple, ~-0.8) created from combining
    sinusoidal patterns. The Viridis colormap transitions from dark purple/blue at
    low Z values to bright yellow/green at high values. The X and Y axes range from
    -4 to 4, with "X Axis" and "Y Axis" labels. The Z axis shows "Z Value" ranging
    from approximately -1 to 1.5. A vertical colorbar on the right displays the Z
    Value scale. The surface is viewed from a 3D perspective with subtle gray grid
    lines, and the overall layout uses a clean white background.
