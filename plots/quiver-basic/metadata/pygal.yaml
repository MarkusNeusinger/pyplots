review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution to implement quiver plot in a library without native vector
    field support
  - Color encoding by magnitude effectively communicates wind speed variation
  - Well-structured code with clear comments explaining the wind simulation
  - Proper arrowhead calculation with consistent head angles
  - Good use of binned colors for categorical wind intensity labels
  - Axis labels with units follow best practices
  - Filtering weak vectors near center improves visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text is too small and positioned in top-left corner far from the data
  - Arrow stroke width could be increased for better visibility at full resolution
  - The implementation is essentially manual arrow drawing rather than using pygal
    distinctive features
  - Consider increasing legend_font_size beyond 36 for better readability
