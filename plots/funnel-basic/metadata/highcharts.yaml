review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent funnel visualization with clear stage progression from Awareness (1000)
    to Purchase (100)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each stage (blue, yellow, purple,
    cyan, brown)
  - Data labels include both absolute values and percentages with clean connector
    lines
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Well-configured funnel neck (30% width, 25% height) creating visually appealing
    shape
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Good use of Highcharts FunnelSeries with proper configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels positioned only on the right side, could be centered or inside segments
    for better balance
  - VQ-07 could be improved with subtle background styling or stage separators
  - Library features score could be higher by adding hover tooltips or animation effects
