review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative encoding system with proper type annotations
  - Smart choice of sqrt scale for population size mapping, handling orders of magnitude
    well
  - Clean visual design with white stroke on bubbles improving definition
  - Interactive tooltips enhance exploratory analysis capability
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs leverage Altair's dual export capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Population legend shows 0.0 as minimum value which is unrealistic and confusing
    for a population metric
  - Generic country labels Country_1 etc. reduce the realistic feel of the economic
    dataset
