review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (blue raw data, yellow rolling
    average) that provide strong contrast
  - Rolling average line appropriately prominent (width=4) while raw data is appropriately
    subdued (opacity=0.4)
  - Legend includes the window size (14-Day Rolling Average) as specified in the spec
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic temperature scenario with believable seasonal patterns
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML outputs leveraging Plotly strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity at 0.1 is almost too subtle; could be increased to 0.2-0.3 for better
    readability
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like customized hover templates showing
    both raw and rolling values, or a range selector for interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series of daily temperature data from
    January 2024 to July 2024. The raw data is shown as a light blue/semi-transparent
    line with noticeable daily fluctuations (noise), while a prominent yellow/gold
    line (width 4) represents the 14-Day Rolling Average smoothly tracing through
    the data. The temperature range spans from approximately -10°C to 40°C, showing
    a clear seasonal warming trend from winter to summer. The title "line-timeseries-rolling
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The legend is positioned in the
    upper left corner with a subtle white background, clearly distinguishing "Raw
    Data" from "14-Day Rolling Average". Both axes have proper labels: "Date" on the
    x-axis and "Temperature (°C)" on the y-axis. The grid is subtle with low alpha
    values. The plot uses a white background (plotly_white template).'
