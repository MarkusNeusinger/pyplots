review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly annotation system with arrows to label taxonomic clades
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny with correct topology and plausible
    branch lengths
  - Clean rectangular phylogram layout with proportional branch lengths
  - Scale bar with proper units enhances scientific communication
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing species name and evolutionary distance
  - Appropriate colorblind-safe color scheme (Python blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines extend into the tree area which could be cleaner
  - No legend present, though this is standard for phylogenetic trees
  image_description: 'The plot displays a rectangular phylogenetic tree (cladogram)
    showing primate evolutionary relationships. The tree has a dark blue (#306998)
    branch structure with yellow (#FFD43B) circular markers at leaf nodes representing
    five species: Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutan, and Gibbon. Species names
    appear in dark gray text to the right of each leaf node. The tree topology shows
    Human and Chimpanzee as the closest relatives, then Gorilla, then Orangutan, with
    Gibbon as the outgroup. Three clade annotations in italic gray text with arrows
    identify "Hominini" (Human-Chimp), "Homininae (African Apes)" (Human-Chimp-Gorilla),
    and "Hominidae (Great Apes)" (all except Gibbon). A scale bar at the bottom left
    shows "0.1 substitutions/site". The x-axis is labeled "Evolutionary Distance (substitutions
    per site)" ranging from 0 to 0.5. The title reads "Primate Evolution · tree-phylogenetic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai". Background is white with subtle gray grid lines.'
