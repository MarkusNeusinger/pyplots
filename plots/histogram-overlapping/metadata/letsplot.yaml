review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario (A/B testing response times) that directly matches
    spec applications
  - Perfect transparency level (alpha=0.5) allows clear visualization of overlapping
    regions
  - High contrast colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility seed
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placed on right creates slight layout imbalance with extra whitespace
  - Grid lines extend beyond data area, could be more contained
  - Could leverage more lets-plot distinctive features (e.g., interactive tooltips
    in HTML output)
