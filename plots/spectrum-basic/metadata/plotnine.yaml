review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent signal processing implementation with realistic mechanical vibration
    scenario showing fundamental and harmonics
  - Proper use of logarithmic frequency scale with annotation_logticks for professional
    axis presentation
  - Clear axis labels with appropriate units (Hz, dB)
  - Good use of dB scale for amplitude visualization as recommended in spec
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper FFT computation
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines not visible because panel_grid_major=element_text(alpha=0.3) uses wrong
    element type - should be element_line not element_text
