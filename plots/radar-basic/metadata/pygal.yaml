review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of employee performance comparison scenario matching specification
    applications
  - Correct title format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai branding
  - Good transparency (0.25 opacity) allowing overlap visibility as per spec requirements
  - Proper canvas dimensions (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled font sizes
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Font sizes deviate from library guidelines (uses 48/32 instead of suggested 28/18)
  - Legend placement in upper-left corner creates visual imbalance
  - Axis label rotation for some categories reduces readability compared to horizontal
    text
