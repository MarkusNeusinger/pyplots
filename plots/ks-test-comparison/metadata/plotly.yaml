review:
  strengths:
  - All spec requirements fully implemented with both ECDFs, K-S statistic, max divergence
    highlight, and p-value
  - Shaded divergence region adds visual storytelling beyond basic spec requirements
  - Credit scoring context is an excellent realistic application for K-S tests
  - Strong Plotly idiom usage with hovertemplate, fill=toself, and HTML export
  - Clean, well-structured code with appropriate complexity
  weaknesses:
  - Distributions are too well-separated (D=0.835) — using distributions that partially
    overlap would better demonstrate the K-S test discriminative power and show where
    ECDFs cross
  - Annotation box arrow could be shorter and annotation positioned closer to the
    divergence line to reduce dead space
  - Visual refinement could be enhanced with spine/axis line styling and tighter whitespace
    management
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step functions on a clean white background. The blue line (#306998)
    represents "Good Customers" and the orange line (#E8590C) represents "Bad Customers",
    plotted against "Credit Score" (X-axis, 0-100) and "Cumulative Proportion" (Y-axis,
    0-1). The Bad Customers CDF rises steeply on the left side (low credit scores),
    while the Good Customers CDF is shifted far to the right (high credit scores),
    showing clear separation. A green dashed vertical line with diamond markers at
    both endpoints marks the point of maximum divergence at approximately credit score
    49. A light green shaded region highlights the area around the divergence zone.
    A bordered annotation box with green outline displays "K-S Statistic / D = 0.835
    / p < 0.001" with an arrow pointing to the midpoint of the divergence line. Subtle
    dotted horizontal reference lines appear at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. The legend is
    positioned in the top-left corner with three entries. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top.
