review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with multiple geom layers (polygon,
    path, point)
  - Creative approach to geographic context without actual basemap by using polygon
    shapes for park and lake
  - Color gradient along path effectively shows trail progress
  - Clear distinction between start (green circle) and end (red square) markers using
    both color and shape
  - Good data generation with realistic coordinates and GPS noise simulation
  - Rolling average smoothing for more natural path appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra Mountain Loop Trail prefix before the required spec-id format
  - Grid could be more subtle (currently alpha=0.3, could use lighter color)
  - Missing direction arrows along the path as suggested in the spec notes (optional
    feature)
  image_description: The plot displays a hiking trail route visualized as a loop path
    on a geographic context. A green polygon represents a park boundary area with
    a green outline. Inside the park, there is a small blue ellipse representing a
    lake feature. The hiking trail follows a loop pattern, rendered as a continuous
    path with a color gradient showing progress from dark blue (0%) through teal and
    olive to yellow (100%). The start point is marked with a green circle marker,
    and the end point with a red square marker, both positioned close together on
    the right side of the loop. The axes show Longitude (°) on the x-axis ranging
    from approximately -121.9 to -121.55, and Latitude (°) on the y-axis ranging from
    approximately 47.68 to 47.95. A color bar legend on the right shows "Trail Progress
    (%)" from 0 to 100. The title reads "Mountain Loop Trail · map-route-path · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai".

        comment: Uses grammar of graphics approach with multiple geom layers, scale_color_gradient,
          coord_fixed, and theme customization. Good use of plotnine features but
          nothing exceptional beyond basic ggplot2 patterns.
