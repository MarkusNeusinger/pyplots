review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature model with realistic sinusoidal pattern peaking
    in late July
  - Clean, professional visual design with well-chosen font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Custom hovertemplate provides good interactivity with formatted date and temperature
  - Proper use of plotly_white template for clean appearance
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Missing plotly-specific features like range slider (rangeslider), zoom buttons
    (rangeselector), or spike lines that are distinctive for time series
  - 'Grid/legend scoring: legend disabled but could optionally show the series name'
  - Line width could be slightly increased (3.0) for better visibility at high resolution
