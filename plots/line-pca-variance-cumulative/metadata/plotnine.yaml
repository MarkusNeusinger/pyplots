review:
  strengths:
  - Uses real Wine dataset from sklearn — genuine PCA analysis with realistic variance
    ratios
  - Clean grammar of graphics composition with well-layered geoms (hline, line, point)
  - Explicit font sizing follows library rules exactly (24/20/16/14pt)
  - Selective grid styling (only faint horizontal lines) creates clean visual
  - Custom y-axis breaks include 90% and 95% to align with threshold lines
  weaknesses:
  - Threshold lines at 90% and 95% are not labeled — viewer must read y-axis tick
    values to identify them; adding text annotations near the lines would improve
    storytelling
  - No elbow point annotation — the spec suggests marking or annotating the elbow
    point if detectable
  - The label column in the thresholds DataFrame is created but never used
  - Y-axis starts at 0 but data starts at ~36%, wasting vertical space in the lower
    region
  - Overall design is competent but not visually distinctive — lacks color accents,
    threshold annotations, or visual hierarchy that would elevate it to publication
    quality
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA on the Wine dataset (13 features). A solid blue line (#306998) with white-filled
    circle markers traces the cumulative variance from approximately 36% at component
    1, rising steeply through components 2-4, then flattening as it approaches 100%
    at component 13. Two horizontal dashed gray reference lines mark the 90% and 95%
    thresholds. The title reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Number of Principal Components" with integer
    ticks 1-13, and the y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Explained Variance" with percentage
    labels (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%). The background uses a minimal
    theme with only faint horizontal grid lines. The classic elbow curve shape is
    clearly visible.
