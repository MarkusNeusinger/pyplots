review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of overfitting visualization with validation loss diverging
    from training loss after epoch 25
  - Clean use of Altair's layered composition with separate chart objects for lines,
    points, and annotations
  - Red diamond marker with annotation clearly indicates the optimal stopping point
    at minimum validation loss
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with strong contrast between blue training and yellow
    validation curves
  - Proper title format and axis labeling including loss function type as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title "Curve Type" is generic; could be more descriptive
  - Points on every epoch (50 points per curve) add visual noise; could use opacity
    or fewer markers
