review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation matching spec recommendation for readable category
    labels
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors for reference line, CIs, and point
    estimates
  - Includes reference line at zero as suggested in spec notes
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with good use of pygal Style system
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario demonstrating varied effect sizes and CI widths
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence interval lines lack caps/endpoints as suggested in the specification
    notes
  - X-axis label Effect Size could include units or be more descriptive
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal point estimate visualization
    with five categories (Treatment A, B, C, D, and Control) arranged vertically on
    the y-axis. Each category shows a yellow/gold circular point marker representing
    the point estimate, with blue horizontal lines extending on both sides to indicate
    95% confidence intervals. A vertical gray reference line is positioned at x=0
    (the null hypothesis line). The x-axis is labeled "Effect Size" with values ranging
    from -1 to 4. The title "point-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in a clean monospace font. A legend at the bottom identifies the three visual
    elements: Reference (x=0), 95% CI, and Point Estimate. The background is white
    with subtle dotted horizontal guide lines.'
