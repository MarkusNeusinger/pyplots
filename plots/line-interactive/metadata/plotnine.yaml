review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution to demonstrate interactivity concepts in a static format using
    annotations
  - Excellent realistic scenario (server response time monitoring)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good use of visual hierarchy with tooltip, zoom region, and anomaly markers
  - Proper datetime handling with scale_x_datetime
  - Colorblind-safe color palette
  weaknesses:
  - plotnine is fundamentally a static plotting library and cannot provide actual
    interactivity - the implementation simulates these with static annotations rather
    than delivering true interactive features
  - No legend for the anomaly markers (red triangles) or average line (dashed gray)
  - Bottom footer text is somewhat cramped and may be hard to read
  - The Interactive Controls footer is misleading since this is a static PNG
