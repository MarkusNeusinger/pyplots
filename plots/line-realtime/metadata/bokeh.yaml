review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the fade/gradient effect showing data recency through
    both alpha and marker size
  - Clear visual indication of scrolling direction with arrow and explanatory text
  - Prominent highlighting of current value with contrasting yellow marker and label
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with believable spike patterns
  - Clean title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of Bokeh annotations (Arrow, Label, VeeHead)
  weaknesses:
  - No legend is present (minor issue for single-series plot)
  - Data stays mostly in the 25-60% range; showing occasional values near 0% or 90%+
    would demonstrate the full scale
  - Could utilize Bokeh HoverTool for interactive HTML output to show values on hover
