review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of S-N curve with proper log-log scaling
  - Clear horizontal reference lines with color-coded labels for Ultimate Strength,
    Yield Strength, and Endurance Limit
  - Realistic steel fatigue data using Basquin equation
  - Interactive tooltips for data points showing cycles and stress values
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Well-balanced canvas utilization with appropriate 16:9 aspect ratio
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend identifying the fit line and data points
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler Curve) for steel fatigue data on a log-log scale. The X-axis shows "Number of Cycles to Failure (N)" ranging from 100 to 10^7, and the Y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from approximately 158 to 501 MPa. Blue data points represent individual fatigue test specimens with visible scatter at each stress level. A solid blue Basquin fit line passes through the data showing the characteristic inverse relationship between stress and cycles.

    Three horizontal dashed reference lines are prominently displayed:
    - Red dashed line at ~501 MPa labeled "Ultimate Strength"
    - Dark yellow/olive dashed line at ~355 MPa labeled "Yield Strength"
    - Green dashed line at 200 MPa labeled "Endurance Limit"

    The title "sn-curve-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with light gray dashed grid lines. Text labels for the reference lines are positioned on the left side of the plot in matching colors. Overall the layout is clean and uses the canvas space effectively.
