review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text readability with appropriately scaled font sizes for 4800×2700
    canvas
  - Data is sorted ascending (smallest at top) making Iceland (85%) appear at the
    bottom as the leader - good visual hierarchy
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle grid lines and well-placed data labels
  - Realistic, relatable data scenario (renewable energy by country)
  - Proper use of Highcharts bar chart type with inline JS for headless Chrome compatibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis title could be more prominent or positioned better
  - X-axis tick labels every 2% create visual clutter; every 10% or 20% would be cleaner
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing "Top 10 Countries
    by Renewable Energy Share (%)" as the subtitle. The title reads "bar-horizontal
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. Ten blue bars (#306998) extend
    horizontally from left to right, with country names on the y-axis (Switzerland
    at top, Iceland at bottom - sorted ascending by value). Each bar has a data label
    showing the percentage value (e.g., "85%" for Iceland, "38.5%" for Switzerland).
    The x-axis shows percentage values from 0% to 100% with tick marks every 2%. The
    background is white with subtle gray gridlines. The layout is clean with good
    spacing between bars.
