review:
  strengths:
  - Team-level labels are readable with budget values displayed clearly ($XXK format)
  - Uses area-proportional sizing (sqrt of value for radius) as specified
  - Realistic company budget scenario with meaningful department/team structure
  - Good use of Altair layered rendering approach for depth
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Department circles overlap significantly with each other, violating the fundamental
    packed without overlap principle of circle packing
  - Legend is positioned outside the visible canvas area and not rendered in output
  - Department labels are not visible (they may be positioned outside their circles
    or hidden)
  - Color differentiation between departments is lost due to overlapping - all circles
    appear as similar blue/gray
  - The 2x2 grid positioning for departments does not account for circle sizes, causing
    overlap
