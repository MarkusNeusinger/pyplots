review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data with 26 plausible technology items placed in sensible
    time-horizon and sector categories
  - Well-implemented 270-degree radial layout with subtle ring background fills creating
    visual separation between time horizons
  - Colorblind-safe four-color palette with good visual contrast between sectors
  - Clean code structure with appropriate use of Plotly's Scatterpolar for polar coordinate
    visualization
  - Interactive HTML export adds value as a distinctive Plotly feature
  weaknesses:
  - Item text labels at 12pt are too small for a 3600x3600 canvas — should be increased
    to at least 14-16pt for better legibility
  - Label clustering and near-overlaps in dense areas (inner rings) reduce readability
    — consider adjusting textposition per-item or using radial offset strategies
  - No visual emphasis or focal points to tell a data story — consider size variation,
    bolding key items, or highlighting the Adopt ring to draw attention
  - Legend does not explain the ring meanings (Adopt/Trial/Assess/Hold time horizons)
    — only shows sector colors
  - Empty space at the bottom of the canvas could be better utilized or the chart
    repositioned
  image_description: 'The plot shows a 270-degree polar radar chart on a white background
    with the title "radar-innovation-timeline · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top in
    dark text (28pt). Four concentric rings are drawn with light gray boundary lines
    (rgba 0.12 opacity), labeled along the right edge as "Adopt" (innermost), "Trial",
    "Assess", and "Hold" (outermost) in gray bold text at 15pt. The angular space
    is divided into four sectors by dotted radial lines: AI & ML (blue #306998, upper
    area), Cloud & Infra (orange #E0872B, right area), Sustainability (teal #2A9D8F,
    lower area), and Biotech (purple #8E4585, left area). Sector headers appear in
    their respective colors along the outer edge at 18pt bold. Each of the 26 technology
    items is plotted as a colored circle marker (size 16) with white edge stroke,
    positioned by sector angle and ring radius with slight random jitter for readability.
    Text labels appear above each marker in the sector''s color at 12pt font size.
    Items include real technologies like "LLM Agents", "RAG Pipelines", "mRNA Therapeutics",
    "CRISPR Diagnostics", "Platform Engineering", "Carbon Tracking APIs", etc. A legend
    in the lower-right corner with white background (95% opacity) and thin gray border
    shows the four sector colors under a "Sectors" heading at 16pt. Subtle blue-tinted
    background fills with decreasing opacity differentiate the ring zones from inner
    to outer. Some label clustering is visible in the inner rings, particularly around
    the "RAG Pipelines"/"Platform Engineering" area and "Carbon Tracking APIs"/"FinOps"
    zone. The overall layout is clean and professional with a light plotly_white template
    background.'
