review:
  strengths:
  - Correct MACD calculation with standard 12, 26, 9 parameters clearly labeled
  - Good color choices with blue MACD, orange signal, green/red histogram
  - Zero reference line with dashed styling helps identify crossovers
  - Proper use of pygal Style class for customization at 4800x2700
  - Legend clearly shows all components with parameter values
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram should be rendered as discrete bars, not filled line areas (spec says
    Display histogram as bars)
  - Contains a function definition (calc_ema) which violates KISS code structure principle
  - Unnecessary HTML file generation (plot.html) beyond requirements
  - X-axis date labels slightly crowded despite rotation
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) technical indicator chart with a white background. The title "indicator-macd · pygal · pyplots.ai" is shown at the top. The chart contains:
    - MACD line (blue): A solid blue line showing the MACD values (12,26 EMA difference), ranging from approximately -3.5 to +1.5
    - Signal line (orange): A solid orange line showing the 9-day EMA of MACD
    - Histogram positive (green): Green filled areas above the zero line representing positive histogram values
    - Histogram negative (red): Red filled areas below the zero line representing negative histogram values
    - Zero reference line (black dashed): A horizontal dashed line at y=0
    - X-axis: Shows dates from Feb 20 to May 20 with rotated labels
    - Y-axis: Labeled "MACD Value" ranging from -3 to +1
    - Legend: Positioned at bottom showing all 5 series (MACD, Signal, Histogram +/-, Zero)
    The data shows realistic MACD behavior with multiple crossovers between MACD and signal lines, and corresponding histogram expansions/contractions.
