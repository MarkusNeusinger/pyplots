review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the Highcharts parallel-coordinates module with proper axis configuration
  - Clear species separation visible in the visualization, demonstrating the power
    of parallel coordinates
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Proper transparency (0.7 alpha) for handling overlapping lines
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labels with units
  - Clean legend handling with showInLegend flag to avoid duplicate entries
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick label font size could be slightly larger for better readability at
    a glance
