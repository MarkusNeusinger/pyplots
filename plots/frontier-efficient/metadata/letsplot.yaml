review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including efficient
    frontier curve, random portfolios, special portfolio markers, and CML
  - Clear color gradient encoding Sharpe Ratio values
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with layer composition
  - Well-structured data generation with realistic financial parameters
  - Title format exactly matches specification
  weaknesses:
  - Missing text annotations/labels for the two special portfolio points (Min Variance
    and Max Sharpe) - they are marked but not labeled on the plot
  - No grid lines visible which could help readers estimate exact values
  image_description: The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. The X-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation)" ranging from 0 to ~0.22,
    and the Y-axis shows "Expected Return" ranging from ~0.03 to ~0.16. The efficient
    frontier is rendered as a thick blue curved line (#306998) that forms the characteristic
    hyperbolic shape from Modern Portfolio Theory. Below and to the right of the frontier,
    approximately 300 random portfolio scatter points are displayed, color-coded by
    Sharpe Ratio using a gradient from yellow (lower ~0.58) to blue (higher ~0.70).
    A gray dashed Capital Market Line (CML) extends from the origin area through the
    tangent point and beyond. Two red diamond markers indicate the Minimum Variance
    portfolio (lower on the frontier ~0.084 return) and Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio
    (higher ~0.103 return). The title correctly uses the format "frontier-efficient
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The legend for Sharpe Ratio is positioned on the right
    side.

        comment: Uses lets-plot grammar of graphics with ggplot(), geom_point(), geom_line(),
          scale_color_gradient(), theme_minimal(), and ggsize(). Good use of layer
          composition but no lets-plot specific interactive features.
