review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good reproducibility
  - Effective use of color gradient to show time progression along the route
  - Appropriate use of XY chart type given pygal limitations (no native map support)
  - Good axis labels with proper units (degrees)
  - Realistic Central Park coordinates for a hiking trail scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order is illogical - START and FINISH markers should bookend the time segments,
    not appear mixed in at the end
  - START and FINISH markers are relatively small compared to the canvas size
  - The plot lacks a geographic basemap (inherent pygal limitation, not fixable)
  - 'Red FINISH marker color matches the 5: End segment color, reducing visual distinction'
  image_description: 'The plot shows a route path map depicting a hiking trail around
    Central Park as an XY chart with longitude on the x-axis (-73.986 to -73.956)
    and latitude on the y-axis (40.75 to 40.79). The route is displayed as a continuous
    loop path divided into 5 colored segments representing time progression: dark
    blue ("1: Start"), cyan ("2: Morning"), green ("3: Midday"), yellow ("4: Afternoon"),
    and red ("5: End"). Two distinct markers appear at the top of the path - a red
    dot for FINISH and a green dot for START, both positioned close together indicating
    a loop trail. The legend is placed at the bottom showing all segments plus the
    START and FINISH markers. The title "map-route-path · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. Grid lines are visible but subtle. The route forms an elongated loop
    shape characteristic of a realistic hiking trail with small GPS noise visible
    in the path.'

        comment: The 5-segment gradient provides good contrast between adjacent segments.
          The red FINISH marker adjacent to the red segment could be confusing.

        comment: The plot fills a reasonable portion of the canvas horizontally but
          leaves significant whitespace. Legend at bottom uses 3 rows.

        comment: Grid is visible but legend organization is suboptimal - START and
          FINISH markers should bookend the time segments for logical route following.
