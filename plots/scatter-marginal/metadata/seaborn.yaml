review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn jointplot for this plot type, which is specifically designed
    for scatter plots with marginal distributions
  - Good visual balance with appropriate font sizes using sns.set_context(talk, font_scale=1.4)
  - Effective combination of histograms and KDE curves in marginal plots as suggested
    by the spec
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) and marker size for 200 data points with
    white edge for visibility
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) instead of domain-specific labels with
    units
  - Data scenario is generic rather than representing a real-world use case
  - Grid uses dashed style which is slightly more prominent than subtle solid gridlines
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with marginal distributions
    using seaborn's jointplot. The central scatter plot shows 200 blue points (#306998)
    with moderate transparency (alpha 0.65) and white edges. There is a clear positive
    correlation visible in the data. The top marginal shows a histogram with ~25 bins
    and an overlaid KDE curve for the X variable distribution. The right marginal
    shows a horizontal histogram with KDE for the Y variable distribution. Both marginal
    histograms use the same blue color with alpha 0.7. The title "scatter-marginal
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels show "X Value" and "Y
    Value" with a subtle dashed grid. The overall layout is square (~1:1 aspect ratio)
    which is appropriate for jointplots.

        comment: Markers sized appropriately (s=150) for 200 points with good alpha
          (0.65). White edge helps distinguish overlapping points. Slightly larger
          than optimal per guidelines (100-200 range for 100-300 points).

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha=0.3), but dashed style slightly more prominent
          than solid alpha grid. No legend needed for single-color scatter.

        comment: Uses seaborn's jointplot which is a distinctive feature. However,
          could have used additional seaborn features like hue parameter or different
          marginal_kind options (e.g., "kde" or "hist+kde" using marginal_ticks).
  verdict: APPROVED
