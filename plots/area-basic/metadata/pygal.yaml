review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the area chart concept with proper fill transparency
    (0.4 opacity)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic website traffic data with clear weekly patterns (weekend dips, weekday
    peaks)
  - Smart X-axis label strategy showing only every 5th day to prevent clutter
  - Correct title format and proper canvas sizing (4800x2700)
  - Good use of pygal Style class for consistent theming
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Visitors could include units (e.g., Visitors count)
  - Data dots could be slightly larger for better visibility at the target resolution
  - Could leverage more pygal-specific features like custom tooltips or value formatting
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart with a light blue/steel
    blue filled area beneath the line. The title "area-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    is clearly visible at the top. The X-axis is labeled "Day of Month" with values
    1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 shown. The Y-axis is labeled "Visitors" with values ranging
    from approximately 900 to 2100. Data points are marked with small dots along the
    line. The area fill has semi-transparency (approximately 40% opacity). A legend
    "Daily Visitors" appears at the bottom left. The background is white with subtle
    horizontal gridlines. The chart shows website traffic patterns with weekend dips
    and weekday peaks.

        comment: Labels are descriptive ("Day of Month", "Visitors") but "Visitors"

          but could be more prominent.
