review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual polar coordinate transformation since Bokeh lacks native polar
    support
  - Clean implementation of concentric radial gridlines and angular spokes
  - Perfect time-based data orientation with midnight at top
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Appropriate sizing and alpha values for visibility
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML
  weaknesses:
  - Missing radial axis labels to show temperature scale/units
  - Could leverage HoverTool to display hour and temperature on hover for interactivity
  - Title font size could be slightly larger for 3600x3600 canvas
