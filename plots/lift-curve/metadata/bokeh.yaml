review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with 42pt title, 32pt axis labels, 24pt tick labels - perfectly
    readable at 4800x2700
  - Clean implementation of lift curve with proper baseline reference line at y=1
  - Decile markers with contrasting yellow fill and blue outline provide clear data
    point emphasis
  - Realistic marketing campaign scenario with 15% baseline response rate
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity - would allow users to see exact lift values
    at each percentage
  - Y-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., Cumulative Lift Model/Random)
  - Legend text slightly small relative to other text elements on the large canvas
