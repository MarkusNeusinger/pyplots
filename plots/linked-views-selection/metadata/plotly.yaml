review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent multi-view layout with proper subplot configuration
  - Good use of Plotly native selection styling (selected/unselected marker states)
  - Custom JavaScript implementation provides true cross-view linked selection
  - Consistent color encoding across all three views
  - Clear instruction text explaining the interaction
  - Proper hover templates with formatted data
  - High-resolution output (1600x900 at scale 3 = 4800x2700px)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility too subtle (alpha 0.1) - could use alpha 0.2-0.3 for better visibility
  - Unused deselected_colors variable defined but not used in trace definitions
  - Bar chart shows identical counts for all species (50 each) which is less informative
    than having varied counts
  image_description: 'The plot displays three coordinated views arranged in a 2x1
    + 2-column layout. The top scatter plot spans the full width and shows Sepal Length
    (x-axis, 4.5-8 cm) vs Sepal Width (y-axis, 2-4.5 cm) with 150 points colored by
    species: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica (red
    #E53935). The three species form distinct clusters with some overlap between Versicolor
    and Virginica. The bottom-left histogram shows Petal Length (cm) distribution
    with overlaid bars for each species - Setosa clusters around 1.5cm, while Versicolor
    (4-5cm) and Virginica (5-6cm) form distinct peaks. The bottom-right bar chart
    shows equal counts (50) for each species. A horizontal legend with the species
    title sits above the scatter plot. An instruction annotation at the bottom reads
    "Click legend items to toggle visibility | Use box/lasso select to highlight points".
    The title "linked-views-selection · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The white background with subtle gridlines provides good contrast.'
