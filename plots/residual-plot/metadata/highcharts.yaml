review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts plotLines feature for zero line and ±2σ threshold
    bands with labels
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme (blue for regular points, orange/red for outliers)
  - Realistic housing price prediction context makes the residual plot meaningful
  - Clean separation of regular residuals vs outliers using different marker shapes
    (circles vs diamonds)
  - Proper interactive HTML version generated alongside PNG
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are completely cut off at the bottom of the image despite setting
    marginBottom
  - Y-axis range is too large (±125k) when actual data only spans approximately ±75k,
    creating excessive whitespace
  - Legend text is too small to read easily at full resolution
  - The +2σ Threshold and -2σ Threshold labels on the plot lines are small and could
    be more prominent
