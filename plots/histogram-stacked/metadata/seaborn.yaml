review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot with multiple=stack for native stacked histogram
    support
  - Clean realistic data scenario with server response times that clearly demonstrates
    the plot type
  - Perfect title format and professional styling with appropriate font sizes
  - Good color palette with white edge lines providing clear segment separation
  - Proper use of hue_order to control logical stacking order
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned outside the plot area to avoid any potential overlap
    with tall bars
  - Color palette could use a more colorblind-optimized palette like colorblind or
    Set2
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked histogram showing server response
    times (in milliseconds) across three geographic regions. The x-axis shows "Response
    Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 10 to 120ms, while the y-axis shows "Frequency"
    from 0 to about 55. Three distinct colors are used: blue (#306998) for US East,
    yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for Europe, and green (#4DAF4A) for Asia Pacific. The bars
    are stacked vertically, with US East at the bottom, Europe in the middle, and
    Asia Pacific on top. The title reads "histogram-stacked · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    and a legend labeled "Server Region" is positioned in the upper right corner.
    The distribution shows US East having faster response times (centered around 45ms),
    Europe in the middle (around 60ms), and Asia Pacific with slower times (around
    75ms). Subtle gray dashed gridlines appear on the y-axis.'
