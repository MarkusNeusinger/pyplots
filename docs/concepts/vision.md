# 🌟 pyplots - Vision

## Mission

**Making Python data visualization effortless: Find the right plot, see it with YOUR data, get working code instantly.**

## The Problem

Developers waste hours on visualization:

- **Library Lock-in**: Pick matplotlib, then realize seaborn was better
- **Discovery Hell**: Finding the right plot type across libraries is frustrating
- **Rigid Categories**: Hard to find specialized plots or discover similar alternatives
- **Generic Examples**: Tutorials show fake data, not yours
- **Outdated Code**: Examples break across Python versions and library updates

## The Solution

**pyplots is an AI-powered platform where specifications meet automation.**

### The Human Touch

While AI can generate plots instantly, **humans need inspiration and choice**. If you just ask AI "make a chart," you'll
get the same generic scatter plot every time.

pyplots is different: **AI curates and maintains, humans discover and choose.**

- Browse hundreds of specialized plot types you didn't know existed
- Compare visual styles side-by-side to find what resonates
- Discover creative approaches from the community
- Choose the exact variation that tells your story

**AI automates the boring parts. You bring the creativity.**

### How It Works

1. **Spec Collection**: Comprehensive markdown specifications for every plot type
2. **AI Code Generation**: Automatically creates implementations for all major libraries
3. **Continuous Quality**: AI validates, tests, and improves examples constantly
4. **Smart Discovery**: Natural language search + dynamic tagging + similarity clustering
5. **Your Data, Instantly**: Upload your data, see dozens of plot variations immediately

### What Makes It Different

- **Library Agnostic**: Compare all 9 libraries side-by-side (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, bokeh, altair, plotnine, pygal, highcharts, lets-plot)
- **Always Current**: AI agents keep examples updated and optimized
- **Multi-Dimensional Discovery**: Find plots by domain (finance, research), type (scatter, bar), or specific use case (
  ROC curve, Sankey diagram)
- **Multiple Styles**: Same plot, different visual styles—pick what you like
- **Natural Language**: Ask "show correlation between variables" instead of searching categories
- **Community + AI**: Users submit specs, AI generates and maintains code
- **Global**: AI-native means any language, anywhere

## Key Features

### Core (Free)

- Browse all plot types with live examples
- Compare libraries side-by-side
- Copy production-ready code
- Natural language search
- AI-generated explanations

### Premium (Future)

- **Try with YOUR data**: Upload CSV/Excel/JSON, see all plots with your actual data

## Why We'll Win

1. **First to solve the real problem**: Your data, not examples
2. **Never outdated**: AI continuously updates and improves
3. **True discovery**: Similarity clustering reveals plots you didn't know existed
4. **Specification-driven**: Every plot is guaranteed to work as described
5. **Community scale**: Open source + AI automation = comprehensive coverage
