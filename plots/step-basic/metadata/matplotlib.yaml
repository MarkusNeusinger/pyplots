  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the stair-step pattern using ax.step() with post style
  - Clear visual representation with well-sized markers highlighting each data point
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario that perfectly matches spec applications
  - All text elements are properly sized for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper-left corner slightly overlaps with the lowest data region
  - Only demonstrates post step style; could showcase more step variations mentioned
    in spec
  - Could use fill_between to add visual distinction to the stepped area
  image_description: The plot displays a step (stair-step) chart showing cumulative
    monthly sales data over 12 months (January through December). The step line is
    rendered in a blue color (#306998) with horizontal lines connected by vertical
    segments creating the characteristic stair-step pattern. Yellow circular markers
    (#FFD43B) with blue borders are placed at each data point to highlight where value
    changes occur. The chart shows cumulative sales increasing from approximately
    45 thousand dollars in January to about 849 thousand dollars by December. The
    x-axis shows month abbreviations (Jan-Dec), and the y-axis displays "Cumulative
    Sales (thousands $)" ranging from 0 to approximately 850. The title "step-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in the upper left identifies
    "Cumulative Sales" (the step line) and "Monthly Totals" (the markers). A subtle
    dashed grid aids in reading values.
