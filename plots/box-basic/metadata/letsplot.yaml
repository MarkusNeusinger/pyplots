  strengths:
  - Excellent use of as_discrete(order_by="..middle..") to order departments by median
    salary — a distinctive lets-plot feature that adds implicit storytelling
  - Clean, colorblind-safe palette derived from Okabe-Ito colors
  - 'Well-tuned theme: minimal chrome with only horizontal grid lines, no ticks, suppressed
    legend'
  - Realistic salary data with intentional variation in distribution parameters (different
    means and standard deviations per department)
  - Explicit outlier injection via 3.5σ and -2.5σ values ensures outliers are visible
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations for median values, or highlight the highest/lowest
    department to guide the viewer interpretation'
  - Outlier markers use dark gray fill (#555555) which reduces their visual prominence
    — consider using the category color or a contrasting accent color
  - Layout has horizontal whitespace imbalance — boxes could be wider or the canvas
    better utilized
  - Department axis label scores lower on units criterion — a subtitle or contextual
    note could compensate
  image_description: 'The plot displays five box-and-whisker plots representing salary
    distributions across departments: HR, Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Engineering
    — ordered left to right by ascending median salary. Each department has a distinct
    fill color: HR in teal/green, Marketing in amber/orange, Sales in light blue,
    Finance in pink, and Engineering in steel blue. Outliers are rendered as dark
    gray filled circles. The title "box-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top left in bold. The Y-axis is labeled "Salary ($)" with values from ~20,000
    to ~140,000, and the X-axis is labeled "Department". The background is clean with
    a minimal theme — only horizontal major grid lines in light gray, no vertical
    grid lines, no axis ticks. The legend is suppressed since the x-axis labels identify
    each category. Boxes have semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.85) with visible median
    lines. The distributions show different spreads: Sales has the widest IQR while
    HR is the narrowest. Multiple outliers are visible above the whiskers for Sales,
    Finance, and Engineering departments.'
