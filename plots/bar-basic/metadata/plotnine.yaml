review:
  strengths:
  - Clean grammar-of-graphics composition with well-layered plotnine idioms
  - Explicit font sizing at all levels (title 24pt, axis titles 20pt, tick text 16pt)
    ensures legibility at 4800x2700
  - Smart use of pd.Categorical with descending sort to create an implicit ranking
    narrative
  - Dollar formatting on both value labels (format_string) and y-axis (scale_y_continuous
    lambda) provides consistent professional number presentation
  - 'Thoughtful theme customization: removed x-gridlines, subtle y-gridlines (alpha=0.2),
    removed ticks'
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label 'Sales' lacks units — should be 'Sales (USD)' or 'Sales ($)' for
    full clarity
  - 'No data storytelling beyond sorting: could benefit from annotations highlighting
    the top category or percentage differences'
  - No bar highlighting or color differentiation to draw attention to key findings
    as the spec suggests
  - Slight over-extension of y-axis above the tallest bar creates unnecessary whitespace
  image_description: 'The plot shows a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" displaying product category sales data. Six blue bars (#306998 Python
    Blue) are arranged in descending order from left to right: Electronics ($45,200),
    Clothing ($32,800), Home & Garden ($28,500), Sports ($19,700), Books ($15,300),
    and Toys ($12,400). Each bar has a dollar-formatted value label positioned just
    above it. The y-axis is labeled "Sales" with formatted tick labels ($0K through
    $40K). The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" with category names centered beneath
    each bar. The background is clean with a minimal theme — no vertical gridlines,
    subtle horizontal gridlines, and no axis ticks. The layout uses a 16:9 landscape
    aspect ratio with good use of canvas space.'

        comment: Y-axis label 'Sales' lacks units. Should be 'Sales (USD)' or 'Sales
          ($)'. X-axis 'Product Category' is descriptive but generic without units.
