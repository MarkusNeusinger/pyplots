quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Effective wireframe visualization with two-tone blue coloring for visual depth
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good 3D viewing angle that reveals the ripple pattern
  - All three axes properly labeled with appropriate ranges
  - Clean code structure with proper Selenium screenshot workflow
  - Colorblind-safe color palette using blue tones
  weaknesses:
  - Z-axis labels at bottom are partially cut off due to viewport/margin issues
  - Uses raw JavaScript configuration instead of highcharts-core Python API
  - Axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis) rather than contextual
