review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with scale_fill_gradient2 for a
    Python-themed diverging palette (blue-to-yellow)
  - Bold cell annotations with conditional text color (white on dark, dark on light)
    ensure readability across all cells
  - Data tells a compelling recovery story — the left-to-right blue-to-yellow progression
    is immediately apparent
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate use of pd.Categorical for axis ordering
  - 'All spec requirements fully met: diverging colormap, annotations, colorbar, logical
    ordering'
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or additional context — consider appending percent or YoY
    context to subtitle
  - Light yellow cells could benefit from slightly stronger saturation for better
    visual contrast
  - Left margin has slightly more whitespace than needed, reducing canvas efficiency
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x8 heatmap titled "Quarterly Growth by
    Department · heatmap-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai." Eight departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR, Research, Support) are arranged on
    the y-axis, and eight quarters (Q1 ''23 through Q4 ''24) on the x-axis. A diverging
    color scheme transitions from steel blue (#306998) for negative values through
    off-white for near-zero to golden yellow (#FFD43B) for positive values. Each cell
    contains a bold annotation showing the exact growth percentage with a +/- sign.
    White borders cleanly separate the tiles. The colorbar on the right is labeled
    "Growth (%)" with a scale from approximately -20 to +20. X-axis labels are rotated
    45 degrees for readability. The visual story is immediately clear: a recovery
    trend flows from left (blue/negative) to right (yellow/positive), with departmental
    variation adding depth. HR and Support show the deepest early negatives while
    Sales and Research recover most strongly.'
