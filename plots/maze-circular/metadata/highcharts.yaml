review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation algorithm using Prims algorithm ensuring a solvable
    maze
  - Clean visual presentation with print-friendly black/white color scheme
  - Well-implemented concentric ring structure with proper sector calculations
  - Good use of Highcharts line series to render complex curved paths
  - Properly marks entry and goal locations
  weaknesses:
  - Entry arrow defined in code is not clearly visible in the final rendered image;
    only the START text shows
  - Does not leverage Highcharts interactive features (tooltips, hover effects disabled)
  - 'The maze appears slightly elliptical due to y-axis scaling (min: 0.1, max: 0.9
    vs x-axis min: 0, max: 1)'
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings
    on a white background. The maze structure consists of black walls (radial and
    arc segments) forming ring-shaped corridors divided into sectors. The number of
    sectors increases with each ring outward. At the center is a blue circular marker
    labeled "GOAL" in blue text. At the bottom of the outer perimeter, there is a
    "START" label in black text indicating the entry point. The maze appears to have
    an opening in the outer boundary at the bottom where the entry is located. The
    title "maze-circular · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The
    maze occupies the majority of the canvas with good proportions. The walls are
    rendered with consistent thickness suitable for print-friendly output. The overall
    layout follows the spec requirements of a circular maze with entry on outer edge
    and goal at center.
