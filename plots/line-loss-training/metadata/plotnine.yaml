review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of training dynamics with clear overfitting pattern visible
    after epoch 30
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean, readable code structure
  - Smart annotation showing optimal stopping point with vertical dashed line
  - Well-chosen color scheme (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Perfect title format and comprehensive axis labeling with loss function specified
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line visibility is inconsistent - some lines appear more prominent than others
    despite same alpha settings
  - 'The Best: 46 annotation could be positioned better - currently placed at a fixed
    y-position that may not scale well with different data'
  - Yellow color for validation loss could benefit from slightly darker shade for
    better contrast against white background
  image_description: 'The plot displays two training curves on a clean white background
    with a minimal theme. The title "line-loss-training · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is
    prominently displayed at the top in bold black text. Below the title is a horizontal
    legend showing "Training Loss" (blue/navy, #306998) and "Validation Loss" (yellow/gold,
    #FFD43B) with circular markers. The X-axis is labeled "Epoch" (0-50), and the
    Y-axis is labeled "Cross-Entropy Loss" (0-2.5). Both curves show exponential decay
    from high initial values (~2.5) that level off. The training loss (blue) continues
    decreasing smoothly to ~0.15, while the validation loss (yellow) plateaus around
    epoch 30 and shows slight uptick afterward, demonstrating overfitting behavior.
    A vertical dashed gray line at epoch 46 marks "Best: 46" indicating the optimal
    stopping point. Both lines have circular point markers. The grid is subtle gray
    with good transparency.'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar (aes, geom_line, geom_point, annotate,
          scale_color_manual, theme_minimal), but doesn't leverage more advanced features
          like faceting or statistical transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
