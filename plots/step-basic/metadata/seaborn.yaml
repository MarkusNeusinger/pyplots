  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and markers
  - Perfect use of post step style appropriate for cumulative data
  - Realistic data scenario (monthly cumulative sales) directly from spec applications
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good color combination that is accessible and visually appealing
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai standards
  weaknesses:
  - Uses seaborn only for styling (sns.set_context) rather than seaborn plotting functions
    - this is essentially a matplotlib plot with seaborn theming
  - Legend label defined but not displayed (acceptable for single series)
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart showing cumulative sales data
    over 12 months (January through December). The chart uses a deep blue (#306998)
    stepped line with horizontal segments connected by vertical risers, creating a
    stair-step pattern. Yellow/gold circular markers (#FFD43B) with blue outlines
    are placed at each data point where values change. The x-axis shows month abbreviations
    (Jan-Dec), and the y-axis shows "Cumulative Sales ($K)" ranging from 0 to approximately
    1200. The title "step-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A subtle
    dashed grid is visible in the background. The cumulative sales start at ~45 in
    January and increase progressively to ~1100 in December.

        comment: Uses matplotlib's ax.step() and ax.scatter() with seaborn only for
          styling (sns.set_context). Does not use seaborn's actual plotting functions.
  verdict: APPROVED
