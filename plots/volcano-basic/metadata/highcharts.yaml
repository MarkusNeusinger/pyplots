review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with blue (#306998), orange (#E07B00), and gray
    (#999999)
  - All three threshold lines (horizontal p-value, two vertical fold change) are clearly
    labeled with annotations
  - Legend includes count of points in each category, enhancing interpretability
  - Realistic differential gene expression data with appropriate distribution of significant
    vs non-significant genes
  - Proper use of Highcharts annotations module for threshold labels
  - Interactive HTML version also generated for web viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Marker opacity/transparency not implemented (spec mentions using alpha transparency
    for overlapping points)
  - Code structure is lengthy due to Selenium screenshot approach, but this is inherent
    to Highcharts
