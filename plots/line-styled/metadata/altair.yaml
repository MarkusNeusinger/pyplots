review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    clearly distinguishable
  - Beautiful color palette with Python Blue and accessible complementary colors
  - Professional typography with well-sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic weather station temperature scenario with seasonal patterns
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure following Altair best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only color swatches, not the actual line styles (Altair limitation
    - strokeDash legend combined with color shows color only)
  - No interactive features (tooltips, hover) which are Altair distinctive strength
  image_description: 'The plot displays a styled line chart showing monthly temperature
    readings from four weather stations (Coastal, Mountain, Valley, Highland) over
    12 months (Jan-Dec). The chart uses distinct line styles: solid blue for Coastal,
    dashed yellow/gold for Mountain, dotted teal/green for Valley, and dash-dot coral/red
    for Highland. The X-axis shows months from January to December, and the Y-axis
    shows Temperature (°C) ranging from -4 to 40. All four lines follow a seasonal
    pattern peaking in summer months (July-August). The title "line-styled · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. A legend in the upper-right corner identifies
    each station with its corresponding color and line style. A subtle grid with dashed
    lines aids readability.'

        comment: Uses basic Altair mark_line and encode. Could leverage Altair's interactive
          features, tooltips, or selection mechanisms, but keeps it simple for styled
          line display
  verdict: APPROVED
