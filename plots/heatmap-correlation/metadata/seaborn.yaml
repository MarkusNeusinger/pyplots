review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn heatmap function with mask parameter for triangle display
  - Well-chosen real estate context with realistic correlated variables showing diverse
    correlation strengths
  - 'Perfect implementation of spec requirements: diverging colormap, centered at
    0, fixed -1 to 1 range, 2-decimal annotations'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good font sizing and layout for the high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Colorbar label is set twice (via cbar_kws and separately on cbar.ax),
    which is redundant but not harmful'
  image_description: The plot displays a lower-triangular correlation matrix heatmap
    for 9 real estate variables (Price, Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Age, Garage Spots,
    Lot size, Distance, Crime Index). The heatmap uses the RdBu_r diverging colormap
    with dark red indicating strong positive correlations (e.g., 0.87 between Price
    and Area), blue indicating negative correlations (e.g., -0.37 between Price and
    Age), and white/light colors near zero. Each cell displays its correlation value
    to 2 decimal places in white text. The upper triangle is masked to reduce redundancy.
    The colorbar on the right shows the range from -1.0 to 1.0 with "Correlation Coefficient"
    label. Variable names appear on both axes with rotated x-axis labels. The title
    follows the required format.
