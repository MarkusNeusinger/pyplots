review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of quadratic bezier curves for smooth arcs with height
    proportional to node distance
  - Effective use of ColumnDataSource for data management and custom Legend with LegendItem
    for clear categorization
  - Clean, realistic data scenario (character interactions) that demonstrates the
    plot type well
  - Proper use of semi-transparency (alpha 0.5-0.7) to handle overlapping arcs
  - Correct title format and comprehensive styling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows numeric tick marks (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) which are redundant since
    character names are already labeled below nodes
  - Could add HoverTool to show edge details on hover, leveraging Bokeh interactive
    capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic arc diagram with 8 character nodes
    (Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry) arranged horizontally along
    a baseline. Curved arcs connect pairs of characters above the baseline, representing
    interactions. The arcs use two colors: Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for long-range
    connections (distance > 5) and Python Blue (#306998) for short-range connections
    (distance ≤ 5). Arc heights are proportional to the distance between connected
    nodes, with taller arcs spanning farther distances. Line thickness varies based
    on connection weight. The title "arc-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the
    top-left. A legend in the top-right explains the color coding. The x-axis shows
    "Characters" with numeric tick marks (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and character name labels
    appear below each node.'
