review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts arearange series for confidence bands with proper
    layering (bands behind lines)
  - Colorblind-safe palette using blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Professional appearance with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic learning curve data showing typical ML training behavior (overfitting
    gap that decreases with more data)
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean separation of training and validation curves with distinct markers (squares
    vs triangles)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend does not include entries for the confidence bands (±1 std) - only shows
    the line series
  - Y-axis could start at 0.65 instead of 0.60 to reduce empty space at the bottom
