review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of StackedBar with invisible spacer series to position bricks at
    correct price levels
  - Proper Renko brick calculation algorithm with 2-brick reversal rule
  - Custom Style configuration optimized for high-resolution (4800x2700) output
  - Clean separation of bullish and bearish data series
  - Good title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue/orange or add patterns)
  - The y-axis labels do not perfectly align with actual price levels due to stacked
    bar nature
  - Unnecessary HTML output file generation
  image_description: The plot displays a Renko chart with 40 bricks showing price
    movements over time. Green bricks represent bullish (upward) price movements and
    red/coral bricks represent bearish (downward) movements. The chart starts around
    $118-120, shows an initial downtrend to approximately $88, then recovers back
    to $114 by the end. The title "renko-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is positioned
    at the top. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" with values from $82 to $120+ in $4 increments.
    The X-axis shows "Brick Index" from 0 to 35+ with labels every 5 indices. A legend
    at the bottom identifies "Bullish (Up)" in green and "Bearish (Down)" in red.
    The background is white with a subtle light gray plot area and horizontal grid
    lines.
