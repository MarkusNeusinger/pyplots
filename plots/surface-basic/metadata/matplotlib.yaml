review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean KISS code structure with logical flow
  - Good viewing angle (30° elev, 45° azim) providing clear 3D perspective
  - Smooth surface rendering with antialiasing enabled
  - Correct title format following specification
  - Colorbar with proper labeling enhances readability
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Axis, Y Axis, Z Axis) rather than descriptive with
    units
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for optimal 4800x2700 rendering (xlabel/ylabel
    at 18pt vs recommended 20pt)
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D surface showing a radial ripple/wave pattern
    centered at the origin. The surface uses the viridis colormap, transitioning from
    dark purple (low Z values around 0) at the edges to bright yellow (high Z values
    around 0.8) at the center peak. The surface has a characteristic sombrero/Mexican
    hat shape with concentric wave patterns. The title "surface-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" is clearly displayed at the top. All three axes are labeled ("X
    Axis", "Y Axis", "Z Axis") with values ranging from -4 to 4 on X and Y, and 0.0
    to 0.8 on Z. A vertical colorbar on the right shows the "Z Value" scale. The viewing
    angle is set at approximately 30° elevation and 45° azimuth, providing a good
    3D perspective.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are clearly readable. Slightly
          smaller than optimal for 4800x2700 but still good.
