review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data generation that clearly demonstrates clustering patterns
    and gaps
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and segment glyph for drawing lines
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.6) for overlapping ticks
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Outputs both PNG and HTML formats as expected for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Rug ticks are far too tall - they span most of the plot height instead of being
    small marks at the axis margin. Traditional rug plots have tick height of ~5%
    of plot area, not 50%+
  - The y-axis range and tick height should be adjusted so ticks appear as small marks
    at the bottom of the plot
  - Consider positioning ticks at y=0 with small height extending upward, making them
    true marginal marks
  - The Bokeh toolbar in the corner adds visual clutter to a static PNG export
