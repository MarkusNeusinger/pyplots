review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart using plotnine grammar of graphics approach
  - Mathematically correct calculation of constant resistance circles and reactance
    arcs
  - Proper conversion from complex impedance to reflection coefficient coordinates
  - Clean layered composition with grid, boundary, axis, data locus, and annotations
  - Realistic RF engineering data scenario with antenna S11 measurements
  - Good use of coord_fixed for maintaining circular aspect ratio
  weaknesses:
  - Frequency labels in yellow may have lower contrast against white background than
    ideal
  - Grid line labels (r=0, r=0.2, x=0.5, etc.) not shown - would enhance educational
    value
  - Data point markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart with the correct circular layout.
    The outer boundary is a black circle representing |gamma|=1 (total reflection).
    Inside, light gray constant resistance circles are drawn (centered along the horizontal
    axis) and constant reactance arcs curve from the right edge. A horizontal real
    axis line passes through the center. The impedance locus is drawn as a connected
    blue (#306998) path with small markers showing an antenna S11 measurement sweep
    from 1-6 GHz. Five frequency labels (1.0 GHz, 2.2 GHz, 3.4 GHz, 4.7 GHz, 6.0 GHz)
    appear in yellow/gold text positioned above their corresponding data points. A
    red dot marks the center point (Z=Z₀) with a red label. The chart uses a clean
    white background with no axis labels or tick marks (appropriate for a Smith chart).
    The title "smith-chart-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the
    top in bold black text.
