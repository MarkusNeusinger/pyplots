review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent Gapminder-style visualization with all key elements: play/pause controls,
    timeline slider, year watermark'
  - Clean code structure with realistic simulated country data showing growth over
    20 years
  - Proper use of Plotly animation features including smooth transitions (cubic-in-out
    easing)
  - Good accessibility with distinct colors and proper font sizing throughout
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Some bubble overlap in the lower-left cluster makes individual countries harder
    to distinguish in year 2000
  - Legend positioned inside the plot area could potentially overlap with data points
    in some frames
  - Year watermark annotation shows static 2000 and does not update with animation
    frames
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gapminder-style animated scatter visualization
    showing 8 countries across 4 regions (North, South, East, West). The x-axis shows
    "GDP per Capita ($)" ranging from 0 to 40k, and the y-axis shows "Life Expectancy
    (years)" ranging from 50 to 85. Bubble sizes represent population. The first animation
    frame (Year 2000) is shown with a large watermark "2000" in the top-right corner.
    Four colors are used: blue for North, yellow/gold for South, red/coral for East,
    and green for West. Play/Pause buttons are visible at the bottom-left, and a timeline
    slider spans the bottom showing years 2000-2020. The current year "Year: 2000"
    is displayed below the x-axis label. The title "scatter-animated-controls · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.'

        comment: Good use of px.scatter animation_frame, custom updatemenus for Play/Pause,
          custom sliders. Could use hover_data more extensively or add animation trails.
