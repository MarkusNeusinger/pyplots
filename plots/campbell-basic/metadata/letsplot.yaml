review:
  strengths:
  - 'Complete spec compliance with all required elements: 5 labeled mode curves, 3
    labeled EO lines, critical speed markers, and highlight zones'
  - 'Strong visual hierarchy: bold colored mode lines clearly distinguished from light
    gray dashed EO lines; red diamonds draw immediate attention to resonance points'
  - 'Effective use of lets-plot distinctive features: layer_tooltips() with rich formatting
    for both mode curves and critical speed markers, flavor_high_contrast_light()
    for professional appearance'
  - Descriptive subtitle provides context about what the critical speed markers represent,
    aiding data storytelling
  - Realistic rotordynamic data with proper mode names, appropriate frequency ranges,
    and physically plausible gyroscopic effects
  weaknesses:
  - 'The 2nd Torsional (red #C0392B) and 1st Torsional (orange #E67E22) could be difficult
    to distinguish for deuteranopia viewers; a blue-purple-teal-yellow-gray palette
    would be more universally accessible'
  - Legend placement in bottom-right data area causes minor visual crowding near the
    lower mode curves and the 1x EO label
  - The intersection-finding code is verbose; the multiple DataFrame constructions
    add code complexity that slightly reduces elegance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with five natural frequency
    mode curves plotted against rotational speed (0-6,000 RPM) on the x-axis and frequency
    (0-120 Hz) on the y-axis. The five modes are: 1st Bending (blue, ~25 Hz, rising
    slightly), 1st Torsional (orange, ~48 Hz, decreasing slightly), 2nd Bending (teal/green,
    ~72 Hz, rising), 2nd Torsional (red, ~88 Hz, rising slightly), and Axial (purple,
    ~105 Hz, decreasing slightly). Three gray dashed engine order lines (1x, 2x, 3x)
    extend diagonally from the origin with increasing slope. Red diamond markers clearly
    indicate critical speed intersections where EO lines cross mode curves. Subtle
    pink/red rectangular highlight zones surround each intersection point. The legend
    is positioned in the bottom-right corner with two sections: Engine Order (dashed
    lines) and Natural Frequency (colored solid lines). The title reads "campbell-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold, with a descriptive subtitle explaining the red
    diamonds. The overall layout is clean with a light background, subtle gray gridlines,
    and good use of color contrast between bold mode lines and light EO lines.'
