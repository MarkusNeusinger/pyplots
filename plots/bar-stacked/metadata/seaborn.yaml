review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with clear segment boundaries (white edge lines)
  - Total value labels above stacks add significant value for quick interpretation
  - Python-themed color palette is distinctive and harmonious
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful seasonal variations in the data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of seaborn styling functions (set_style, set_context, despine)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib ax.bar for stacking rather than seaborn native plotting functions
    - does not showcase seaborn distinctive capabilities
  - The two yellow shades (Clothing and Sports) are somewhat similar which could cause
    confusion for some viewers
