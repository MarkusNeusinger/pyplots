review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform density representation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate bin count (40) balances resolution and noise for 5000 data points
  - cmin=1 effectively hides empty bins, improving visual clarity
  - Proper font sizing throughout (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  - Colorbar well-positioned and labeled
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual or domain-specific
  - Missing grid (though acceptable for heatmaps, a subtle grid could help read values)
  - Could showcase more matplotlib-specific features like hexbin alternative or marginal
    histograms
