review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent filled contour visualization achieved despite pygal not natively supporting
    contour plots
  - Creative SVG injection technique demonstrates advanced pygal customization
  - Smooth color gradients with 25 levels and proper diverging colormap
  - Marching squares algorithm for contour line overlay
  - Proper colorbar with Intensity label and tick marks
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced margins
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Contour overlay lines are quite subtle (opacity 0.4) and could be more visible
    for precise level identification
  - Code uses helper functions (interpolate_color, lerp) which deviates from KISS
    principle
  - Axis labels lack units - could use generic units like Position (a.u.) or similar
