review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological accuracy with real primate species and realistic divergence
    times
  - Clean rectangular cladogram layout with proportional branch lengths
  - Colorblind-safe blue-yellow palette distinguishing taxonomic ranks from species
  - Scale bar properly implemented using Highcharts annotations
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced margins and readable species labels
  - Reversed x-axis correctly shows time going back from present (0) to past (80 MYA)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the meaning of different blue shades (taxonomic ranks)
  - Code uses helper function (assign_y_positions) instead of pure KISS flat structure
  - Grid lines for Y-axis are hidden but could show subtle reference lines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phylogenetic tree diagram showing primate
    evolutionary relationships. The layout is rectangular/cladogram style with the
    root on the right side and species leaves on the left. The x-axis shows "Divergence
    Time (Million Years Ago)" ranging from 80 to 0 MYA (reversed). Nine primate species
    are labeled with yellow circular markers: Nasalis larvatus, Colobus guereza, Papio
    anubis, Macaca mulatta, Symphalangus syndactylus, Hylobates lar, Pongo pygmaeus,
    Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens. Branch lines are colored in shades of blue
    (varying by taxonomic rank) with yellow for species nodes. A scale bar labeled
    "Scale: 25 MYA" is positioned at the bottom center. The title reads "Primate Phylogeny
    · tree-phylogenetic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the
    data source. The background is white with subtle gray grid lines.'
