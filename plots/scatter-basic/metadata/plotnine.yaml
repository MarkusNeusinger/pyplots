review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing following library guidelines
    (title=24, axis_title=20, axis_text=16)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper ggplot2-style grammar
    of graphics
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) that is immediately
    understandable
  - Proper use of alpha=0.7 for point transparency as recommended in spec
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not utilize color or size aesthetics to demonstrate additional plotnine capabilities
  - Grid configuration uses element_line with alpha parameter which may not fully
    render as expected in all plotnine versions
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D scatter plot with "Study Hours (per week)"
    on the x-axis (ranging from ~1 to 10) and "Exam Score (points)" on the y-axis
    (ranging from ~20 to 106). The data points are rendered as blue circles (#306998)
    with moderate transparency (alpha=0.7). The title "scatter-basic · plotnine ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clear font. The plot uses a minimal theme
    with subtle gray grid lines. The 150 data points show a clear positive correlation
    between study hours and exam scores, with visible scatter/noise around the trend
    line. The layout is clean with good proportions in 16:9 aspect ratio.

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_point + theme_minimal),
          but doesn't leverage advanced features like faceting, stats, or aesthetic
          mappings for color/size
  verdict: APPROVED
