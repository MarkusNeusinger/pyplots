review:
  strengths:
  - Clean dual-pane layout with proper 75%/25% height ratio
  - Excellent color scheme using Python blue/yellow that is colorblind-safe
  - Volume bars correctly colored to match candlestick direction for visual consistency
  - Proper date formatting with business days and rotated labels
  - Good use of matplotlib subplots with shared x-axis
  weaknesses:
  - Missing crosshair/cursor spanning both panes as specified in requirements
  - Candlestick wicks are thin (linewidth=1.5) - could be slightly thicker for better
    visibility at scale
  image_description: The plot displays a professional dual-pane candlestick chart
    with volume. The upper pane (~75% height) shows OHLC candlesticks over 60 trading
    days from January to late March 2024. Up days (Close ≥ Open) use Python Blue (#306998),
    down days use Python Yellow (#FFD43B). Price ranges from ~$120 to ~$165 with a
    clear downtrend visible. The lower pane (~25% height) shows corresponding volume
    bars in matching colors, ranging from 0 to ~10M shares. Both panes share a common
    x-axis with date labels (Jan 01, Jan 15, etc.) rotated 45°. The title "candlestick-volume
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed. A legend in the upper left
    explains the color coding. Subtle dashed grid lines (alpha=0.3) appear in both
    panes.
