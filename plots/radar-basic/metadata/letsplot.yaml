review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using polar-to-cartesian coordinate transformation
  - Clean construction of gridlines (concentric circles) and spoke lines
  - Perfect use of transparency (alpha=0.25) for overlapping polygons
  - Professional Python color scheme (blue and yellow)
  - Properly closes polygons by repeating the first point
  - Clear, readable category labels positioned at outer edge
  - Square format (1200x1200 with scale=3) appropriate for symmetric radar chart
  weaknesses:
  - Grid value labels (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) appear inverted/upside-down on the vertical
    axis - they read from center outward but the visual suggests values increase toward
    center
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive features (tooltips showing exact values)
    since HTML output is generated
