review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data choice that perfectly demonstrates density estimation capabilities
  - Perfect title format following spec requirements
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate bandwidth parameter (5) for smooth KDE
  - Good use of Altair transform_density for native KDE computation
  - Professional color choice with Python Blue and appropriate transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are more prominent than ideal (no alpha configuration applied to grid)
  - Interactive version created but main chart does not include tooltips showing density
    values at cursor position
