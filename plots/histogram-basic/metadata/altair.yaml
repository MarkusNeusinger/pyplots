review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic human height data provides an intuitive example
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Tooltips added for interactivity in HTML output
  - Appropriate bin count (maxbins=30) for the data size
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to aid in reading frequency values
  - Could add bar edge/stroke color for better visual definition between bins
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram showing the distribution of human
    heights in centimeters. The chart uses a solid blue color (#306998) for the bars.
    The x-axis is labeled "Height (cm)" ranging from approximately 135 to 210 cm,
    and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency" ranging from 0 to 110. The distribution
    follows a clear bell-curve shape centered around 170 cm, with the peak frequency
    of about 102 observations. The title "histogram-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The bars are adjacent with no gaps between them, creating a proper
    histogram appearance. The layout is clean with good proportions.
