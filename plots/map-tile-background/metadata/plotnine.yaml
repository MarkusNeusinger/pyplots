review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario using San Francisco landmarks with plausible
    visitor counts
  - Creative approach to simulate tile-style background using geom_rect with terrain-type
    coloring
  - Good use of plotnine layered grammar of graphics (4 distinct layers)
  - Well-implemented size and color encoding with appropriate legends
  - Colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct categories
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Title is truncated/cut off on the left side missing the beginning of the spec-id
  - 'Label overlap issue: Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39 labels partially overlap despite
    code attempting to filter'
  - This is a simulated tile background rather than real map tiles (understandable
    given plotnine limitations)
  - Missing tile provider attribution as required by spec
  - Grid and legend section could be better balanced
  image_description: 'The plot displays a simulated map of the San Francisco Bay Area
    showing 15 landmark locations as colored circular markers on a tile-style background.
    The background consists of rectangular grid cells colored in two tones: beige/tan
    (#E8E4D8) for land areas and light blue (#B8D4E8) for water areas (the Bay). A
    dark gray polygon outlines the San Francisco peninsula coastline. Markers are
    sized by visitor count (larger = more visitors) and colored by category using
    8 distinct colors. Four labels with white backgrounds appear for top attractions:
    "Golden Gate Bridge", "Fisherman''s Wharf" (partially overlapping with "Pier 39"
    label), and "Union Square". The title is truncated at the left edge showing only
    "arks · map-tile-background · plotnine · pyplots.ai". Two legends appear on the
    right: a size legend for "Visitors (K/yr)" and a color legend for "Category" with
    8 items (Cultural, Historic, Landmark, Museum, Shopping, Sports, Tourism, Transport).'

          workaround simulation rather than true tile maps which plotnine cannot natively
          support
