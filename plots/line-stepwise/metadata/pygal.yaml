review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step visualization achieved through clever data point duplication for
    horizontal-then-vertical transitions
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate Python Blue color scheme
  - Realistic server response time scenario that clearly demonstrates discrete state
    changes
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Manual step data construction is verbose; pygal native line interpolation options
    could be explored
  - Right margin has slight excess whitespace
  - Grid only shows Y-axis guides; X-axis guides could improve readability of hour
    markers
  image_description: The plot displays a step line chart showing server response times
    over a 24-hour period. The line is rendered in Python Blue (#306998) on a white
    background. The chart clearly shows horizontal segments representing constant
    response times, with vertical jumps at specific hours (8, 12, 14, 18, 21, 23).
    The Y-axis ranges from 40ms to 200ms with "Response Time (ms)" label. The X-axis
    shows hours 0-24 with "Hour of Day" label. Subtle horizontal grid lines aid readability.
    The title "line-stepwise · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in the correct
    format.
