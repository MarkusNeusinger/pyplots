review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent streaming visualization with clear age progression via color and size
    encoding
  - Well-designed custom style with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Custom tooltips provide detailed per-point information (temperature, humidity,
    age)
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles
  - Realistic sensor data scenario with meaningful temperature-humidity correlation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entry labels use different format than intended time labels (shows reversed
    order from code comments)
  - Points in dense regions could benefit from slight alpha transparency for better
    visibility
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (currently dotted lines are prominent)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot visualizing streaming sensor
    data with temperature (°C) on the x-axis (ranging from 15-35) and humidity (%)
    on the y-axis (ranging from 30-80). Data points are color-coded in a gradient
    from light blue to dark blue representing different time windows, with 5 series
    shown in the legend at the bottom: "240-300s ago" (lightest), "180-240s ago",
    "120-180s ago", "60-120s ago", and "0-60s ago" (darkest). The marker sizes also
    vary by age, with newer points appearing larger. The title follows the correct
    format "scatter-streaming · pygal · pyplots.ai". Subtle dotted grid lines help
    with reading values, and the plot shows a clear negative correlation between temperature
    and humidity. The overall layout is clean with good use of canvas space.'
