review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with meaningful cool-to-warm color gradient that reinforces
    the seasonal temperature narrative
  - Perfect implementation of the ridgeline pattern using geom_ribbon with appropriate
    overlap (~60%)
  - Clean, readable layout with proper text sizing and minimal grid lines
  - Realistic monthly temperature data that effectively demonstrates the plot type's
    purpose
  - Proper use of plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_ribbon + scale_fill_manual
    + theme)
  weaknesses:
  - Baseline lines visible at each ridge level create minor visual noise (the dark
    horizontal lines at y=0 for each month)
  - Manual KDE computation using scipy.stats rather than leveraging plotnine's native
    density statistics
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ridgeline/joy plot showing monthly temperature
    distributions throughout the year. The plot uses a cool-to-warm color gradient:
    winter months (Jan, Feb, Dec) appear in deep blue (#306998), transitioning through
    teals and greens for spring months (Mar-May), to golden yellows (#FFD43B) for
    summer months (Jul-Aug), and back through amber/ochre tones for fall (Sep-Nov).
    Each month is represented as a smoothly overlapping density curve stacked vertically,
    creating the characteristic "mountain ridge" appearance. The x-axis shows Temperature
    (°C) ranging from -10 to 40, and the y-axis displays month labels (Jan through
    Dec). The title correctly reads "ridgeline-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The
    plot has a clean minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines only on the x-axis.'

        comment: Good color gradient from blue to yellow, though the progression relies

        comment: Horizontal grid lines are removed (good) but there are visible baseline
          lines at y=0 for each ridge that create visual noise; legend appropriately
          hidden since colors are self-explanatory through month labels

        comment: Shows seasonal variation excellently with different means and spreads;
          winter months are colder with moderate spread, summer months warmer with
          tighter distributions. Could show more variance in distribution shapes (e.g.,
          bimodality)

        comment: Temperature values are realistic for temperate climate; range of
          -10 to 40 covers the data well though some summer peaks extending past 35°C
          is slightly high

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_ribbon for ridges, scale_fill_manual
          for custom colors, theme customization. However, doesn't use plotnine's
          native stat_density or geom_density_ridges (if available via extension),
          instead manually computes KDE with scipy
