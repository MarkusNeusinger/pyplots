review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent viridis-inspired colorblind-safe color palette effectively encoding
    velocity magnitude
  - Clean implementation of Euler integration for streamline tracing
  - Well-formatted title following the pyplots.ai convention
  - Good axis labeling with units and clear subtitle explaining the vector field equations
  - Properly distributed starting points across multiple radii creating visually balanced
    concentric streamlines
  weaknesses:
  - HTML overlay legend is not integrated into Highcharts native charting; using colorAxis
    would be more elegant
  - Grid/Legend scoring affected by custom HTML approach rather than native Highcharts
    legend
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vortex flow field visualization with concentric
    circular/spiral streamlines centered around the origin. The streamlines flow counterclockwise
    as expected from the u = -y, v = x vector field equations. Colors range from dark
    purple (inner circles, low velocity magnitude ~1.0) through blue and teal (medium
    velocities) to bright green (outer circles, high velocity magnitude ~3.0). The
    title "streamline-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is clearly displayed at the
    top, with a subtitle explaining the vortex formula. Axes are labeled "X Position
    (arbitrary units)" and "Y Position (arbitrary units)" with clear gridlines. A
    velocity magnitude legend appears in the upper right showing four color categories:
    High (3.0), Med-High, Med-Low, and Low (1.0).'

        comment: Uses LineSeries, custom HTML legend, proper Highcharts options configuration;
          however, does not leverage more advanced Highcharts features like built-in
          colorAxis or streaming data capabilities
  verdict: APPROVED
