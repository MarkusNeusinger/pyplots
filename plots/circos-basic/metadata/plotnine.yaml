review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex circos plot using only plotnine native grammar
    of graphics, without falling back to matplotlib
  - Beautiful color palette with 6 distinct, colorblind-accessible colors for regions
  - Proper chord/ribbon geometry with Bezier curves connecting segments through center
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear data structures for segments, arcs, chords,
    and tracks
  - Realistic trade flow scenario with meaningful bidirectional connections between
    world regions
  - Includes inner data track as specified, adding visual depth
  weaknesses:
  - Inner data track shows the same data as outer ring (segment totals) rather than
    different attribute data
  - Some chord ribbons are quite thin and could be more visible
  - Slight layout imbalance with more empty space at bottom of canvas
  image_description: 'The plot shows a circos/chord diagram visualizing trade flows
    between 6 world regions: Europe (yellow), North America (green), South America
    (orange), Middle East (red), Africa (purple), and Asia (blue). The circular layout
    has an outer ring showing each region as a colored arc segment, with segment sizes
    proportional to total trade volume. An inner concentric track (lighter shading)
    provides an additional data layer. Ribbons/chords connect regions through the
    center, with ribbon width proportional to trade flow values. The title "circos-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Region labels are positioned outside
    the ring in bold dark text. A legend on the right shows the color mapping for
    each region.'

        comment: Title is large and clear (24pt), region labels are bold and readable,
          legend text is appropriately sized. Slightly deducted as some labels could
          be slightly larger.

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_polygon, geom_path, geom_text,
          scale_fill_manual, and comprehensive theming. However, this is a creative
          workaround since plotnine doesn't have native circos support - the implementation
          builds the circular geometry manually using standard geoms.
  verdict: APPROVED
