  image_description: 'The plot displays a force-directed network graph with 50 nodes
    organized into 3 clearly visible communities. The title "network-force-directed
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Nodes are colored by community:
    **blue** (Sales) cluster on the right side, **yellow** (Marketing) cluster in
    the lower-center, and **red/coral** (Engineering) cluster in the upper-left. Gray
    lines connect nodes representing edges/relationships. The communities are visually
    separated with sparse bridge connections between them. A legend at the bottom
    identifies the four series: "Connections", "Engineering", "Marketing", and "Sales".
    The layout shows the force-directed algorithm successfully clustering related
    nodes together.'
