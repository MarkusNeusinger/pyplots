  image_description: 'The plot displays an equilateral triangle representing a ternary
    diagram for soil composition with three components: Sand (bottom-left vertex),
    Silt (bottom-right vertex), and Clay (top vertex). The triangle has a black outline
    with gray grid lines at 20% intervals creating a mesh pattern inside. Approximately
    50 blue circular data points (Python Blue #306998) with darker blue outlines are
    scattered across the triangle, representing different soil samples. Tick labels
    (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) are placed along each edge. The title reads "Soil Composition
    · ternary-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top center. The vertex labels are
    bold and clearly positioned outside the triangle. The overall layout is clean
    with good whitespace margins.'
  verdict: APPROVED
