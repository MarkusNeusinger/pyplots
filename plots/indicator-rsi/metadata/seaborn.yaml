review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements (zones, thresholds, centerline)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic RSI data generation with mean-reversion and market event simulation
  - Good visual hierarchy with color-coded zones and threshold lines
  - Proper title format and axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only shows zone labels, could include RSI line for completeness
  - RSI data clipped to 15-85 means no actual overbought points (>70) are reached/marked
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib for styling rather than seaborn-specific features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 16:9 RSI (Relative Strength Index) chart
    spanning from January 2024 to June 2024 (approximately 120 trading days). The
    chart has a white background with two clearly shaded zones: a red/pink overbought
    zone (70-100) at the top and a green oversold zone (0-30) at the bottom. A blue
    RSI line (approximately linewidth 3) oscillates between these zones, starting
    around 50, rising to touch the overbought threshold (~70) in mid-January, then
    declining sharply into the oversold zone during February-March where green scatter
    markers highlight oversold points. The RSI dips to around 15 in mid-March before
    recovering. Another push toward overbought occurs in May (~62) before declining
    again. Horizontal dashed reference lines mark 70 (red), 30 (green), and a solid
    gray centerline at 50. Text annotations on the right side label "Overbought (>70)",
    "Neutral (50)", and "Oversold (<30)". The legend in the upper right shows "Overbought
    Zone" and "Oversold Zone". The title follows the correct format: "indicator-rsi
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axis labels are "Date" (x-axis) and "RSI (14-period)"
    (y-axis). The Y-axis is correctly fixed from 0 to 100.'
