review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature pattern with realistic daily variation using sine
    wave + noise
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Smart date formatting with scale_x_datetime adapts well to year-long timeframe
  - Rotated x-axis labels prevent overlap while maintaining readability
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate grid styling
  - Correct figure sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more lets-plot specific features like tooltips or interactivity
  - Line thickness slightly heavy for 365 data points - could be reduced to 1.0
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing daily temperature
    data over one year (January 2024 to January 2025). The line is rendered in a blue
    color (#306998) with good visibility. The x-axis shows dates formatted as "Mon
    YYYY" (e.g., "Jan 2024", "Feb 2024") with labels rotated at 45 degrees for readability.
    The y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately -7 to 35 degrees.
    The title "line-timeseries · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold.
    The data shows a clear seasonal pattern with cold temperatures in winter (around
    0°C or below), rising through spring, peaking in summer (around 25-35°C), and
    declining again in fall/winter. Grid lines are visible in light gray. The plot
    fills the canvas well with balanced margins.
