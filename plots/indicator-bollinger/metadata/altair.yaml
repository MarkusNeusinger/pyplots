review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic random walk price simulation
  - Proper Bollinger Band calculation (20-period SMA, 2 std dev)
  - Clean layer composition with band_area, upper_line, lower_line, sma_line, price_line
  - Good color scheme with yellow price line standing out against blue bands
  - Correct use of Altair encoding types (T for temporal, Q for quantitative)
  - Appropriate subtitle explaining the band parameters
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify what each line represents (close price vs SMA vs bands)
  - No interactivity (tooltips, zoom) which is Altair's strength for financial data
    exploration
  image_description: The plot displays a Bollinger Bands chart with 120 trading days
    of stock price data (January-June 2024). The chart features a yellow/gold line
    for the closing price showing significant volatility and a downward trend from
    ~$146 to ~$137. A blue dashed line represents the 20-period Simple Moving Average
    (SMA) serving as the middle band. A light blue semi-transparent fill area shows
    the volatility envelope between upper and lower Bollinger Bands. The Y-axis shows
    "Price ($)" with values ranging from $118-$174, and the X-axis shows "Date" with
    monthly labels (Jan 2024 - Jun 2024). The title reads "indicator-bollinger · altair
    · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "20-period SMA with 2 standard deviation bands". The
    price frequently touches both upper and lower bands, demonstrating typical Bollinger
    Band behavior with band contractions and expansions visible.
