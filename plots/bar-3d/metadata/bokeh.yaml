review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D isometric projection with proper painter's algorithm for correct
    face ordering
  - Semi-transparency (alpha=0.75) effectively reveals occluded bars as spec recommends
  - Viridis color gradient reinforces z-values for better depth perception per spec
  - Face shading (top=100%, front=85%, right=70%) provides convincing 3D appearance
  - Clean axis labels positioned correctly in 3D space
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation in data
  weaknesses:
  - Title format uses hyphens/dashes instead of middle dots as required by SC-06
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3D bar chart showing quarterly sales data
    across 5 products (A through E) over 4 quarters (Q1-Q4). The visualization uses
    an isometric projection with bars rendered as 3D rectangular prisms. Colors are
    mapped using the Viridis palette, ranging from dark blue (low values ~45) through
    green to bright yellow (high values ~130). Product C has the tallest bars (yellow/green,
    ~120-130 range), Product D has the shortest (dark blue, ~45-60 range). The chart
    includes: three axes (Products, Quarters, and implied Z for height), clear product
    labels along one axis, quarter labels along another, a color bar on the right
    showing "Sales (thousands)" with scale from 0-130, and a title "Quarterly Sales
    by Product - bar-3d - bokeh - pyplots.ai". The bars have semi-transparency (alpha=0.75)
    with subtle edge lines, and face shading to give 3D depth perception. Background
    is light gray with subtle dotted grid lines.'
