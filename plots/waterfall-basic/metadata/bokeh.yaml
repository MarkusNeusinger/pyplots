review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waterfall chart logic with proper bar positioning
    (floating bars for changes)
  - Clear visual distinction between totals (blue), increases (green), and decreases
    (red)
  - Connector lines effectively show the cumulative flow between bars
  - Well-formatted value labels with +/- signs for changes
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and FactorRange for categorical data
  - Proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with appropriate font scaling
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity (Bokeh key strength)
  - Red-green color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue-orange)
  image_description: 'The waterfall chart displays a quarterly financial breakdown
    from "Starting Revenue" ($150,000) to "Net Income" ($130,000). Seven bars are
    shown with distinct coloring: blue (#306998) for total bars (first and last),
    green (#2ECC71) for positive changes (Product Sales +$50,000, Services +$35,000),
    and red (#E74C3C) for negative changes (Refunds -$8,000, Operating Costs -$75,000,
    Marketing -$22,000). Dashed gray connector lines show the cumulative flow between
    bars. Value labels appear above each bar with appropriate formatting. The title
    reads "waterfall-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" in the top-left. X-axis shows "Financial
    Category" with rotated category labels, Y-axis shows "Amount ($)" with values
    from 0 to ~250,000. Background is light gray (#FAFAFA) with subtle horizontal
    grid lines.'
