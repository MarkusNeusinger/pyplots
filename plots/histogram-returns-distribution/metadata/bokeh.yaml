review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements (normal overlay, stats
    box, tail highlighting)
  - Good color scheme with blue main distribution and red tail regions
  - Statistics box with all required metrics (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of Bokeh-specific features like BoxAnnotation and ColumnDataSource
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text in top-right is quite small relative to the plot size
  - Could benefit from HoverTool to show bin values on hover (Bokeh interactive strength)
  - The iteration approach for histogram bars is verbose; could potentially use vbar
    with color mapper
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily financial returns distribution.
    Blue bars represent the main distribution centered around 0%, while red/salmon-colored
    bars indicate tail regions beyond ±2 standard deviations. Light red shaded background
    areas highlight these tail risk zones on both sides of the distribution. A yellow/gold
    normal distribution curve is overlaid for comparison, showing how the actual returns
    compare to theoretical normality. The x-axis shows "Daily Returns (%)" ranging
    from approximately -4% to 6%, and the y-axis shows "Density" from 0 to approximately
    0.35. A statistics box in the lower-left corner displays key metrics: Mean: 0.044%,
    Std Dev: 1.448%, Skewness: 0.300, Kurtosis: 0.580. Below the statistics box, red
    text reads "Red: Beyond 2σ (tail risk)" explaining the tail region coloring. The
    legend in the top-right shows "Normal Distribution" for the overlay curve. The
    title correctly follows the required format "histogram-returns-distribution ·
    bokeh · pyplots.ai".'
