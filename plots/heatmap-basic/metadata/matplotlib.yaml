review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of TwoSlopeNorm to properly center the diverging colormap at zero
  - Smart adaptive text color (white on dark cells, dark gray on light cells) ensures
    readability across all values
  - Visual emphasis on strong correlations (|r| >= 0.6) through bold, larger text
    creates effective data storytelling
  - Clean modern aesthetic with removed spines, hidden tick marks, and white grid
    line cell separation
  - Well-chosen realistic business scenario with plausible correlation values
  weaknesses:
  - coolwarm colormap is not perceptually uniform; a colormap like RdBu_r might be
    slightly more accessible
  - Both axis labels simply say Department which is repetitive — could be differentiated
    or one removed
  - Annotation loop could be slightly more concise
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 department correlation matrix heatmap
    using the coolwarm diverging colormap. Eight departments (Sales, Marketing, Support,
    Dev, HR, Finance, Ops, Legal) are labeled on both axes. Each cell contains the
    correlation coefficient value annotated in the center. The diagonal cells show
    1.00 in dark red. Strong positive correlations (e.g., Sales-Marketing at 0.82)
    appear in deep red with larger bold white text, while strong negative correlations
    (e.g., Dev-Finance at -0.65) appear in blue with larger bold white text. Weak
    correlations use smaller dark gray text on lighter background colors. White grid
    lines cleanly separate all cells. The colorbar on the right ranges from -1.00
    (blue) to 1.00 (red) with 0.00 centered, labeled "Correlation Coefficient". Spines
    are removed for a modern look. The title reads "heatmap-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. Both axes are labeled "Department". The square layout fills the canvas
    well.
