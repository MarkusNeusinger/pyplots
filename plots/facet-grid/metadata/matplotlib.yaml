review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent two-way faceting implementation with clear row and column structure
  - Realistic temperature vs energy consumption scenario that varies meaningfully
    across regions and seasons
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate use of pandas for data management
  - Good color palette that distinguishes regions while remaining colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of shared axes (sharex=True, sharey=True) for easy comparison across
    facets
  - Effective use of supxlabel/supylabel for shared axis labels
  - White edge on markers improves visibility when points overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Grid and legend score could be improved by adding a small legend explaining region
    colors
  - Row labels positioned with xy=(1.05, 0.5) are functional but tight_layout rect
    may clip them slightly
  - South summer temperatures reaching ~50°C are on the extreme end for realistic
    data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3×4 grid of scatter plots showing Energy
    Consumption (kWh) vs Temperature (°C). The columns represent seasons (Spring,
    Summer, Fall, Winter) and rows represent regions (North, South, East). Each region
    uses a distinct color: North is blue (#306998), South is yellow (#FFD43B), and
    East is green (#4DAF4A). The main title "facet-grid · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Row labels (North, South, East) are positioned on the right
    side of each row. All subplots share the same axes scales, with temperature ranging
    from approximately -10 to 50°C and energy consumption from ~100 to 450 kWh. Subtle
    dashed grid lines are present in each subplot. The relationship between temperature
    and energy consumption varies by season and region, showing realistic patterns
    where extreme temperatures lead to higher energy consumption.'

        comment: Good use of plt.subplots with sharex/sharey, fig.supxlabel/supylabel,
          axes array indexing; could leverage matplotlib's GridSpec for more advanced
          layout control
  verdict: APPROVED
