review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (O, Q,
    N)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between segments
  - Total value labels above stacks as recommended in spec
  - Clean white stroke separators between bar segments improve readability
  - Tooltips add interactivity for HTML output
  - Proper stacking order (largest category at bottom) using Order encoding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned slightly far from the chart area, creating visual separation
  - Could use Altair selection features for interactive highlighting
