review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent terrain colormap choice (green → tan → white) that is both aesthetically
    appropriate and accessible
  - Well-labeled contour lines with smart positioning algorithm that avoids overlap
  - Geographic context with coastline and state borders provides spatial reference
  - Good use of lets-plot layered grammar approach combining filled contours, line
    contours, and geographic features
  - Realistic mountain peak data based on actual Western US geography
  weaknesses:
  - Only 4 contour labels visible; specification suggests labeling at appropriate
    intervals - more labels would improve readability
  - Aspect ratio slightly distorts geographic area (coord_fixed with ratio=1.0 may
    not be accurate for this latitude range)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a geographic contour map depicting elevation
    data for the Western United States mountain region (approximately 35°N to 45°N
    latitude, -120°W to -105°W longitude). The visualization uses filled contours
    (geom_contourf) with overlaid contour lines (geom_contour). A terrain-appropriate
    colormap is used: green for lower elevations (~1,000-2,000m), transitioning through
    tan/brown (~3,000-4,000m) to near-white for the highest peaks (~5,000-6,000m).
    A simplified blue coastline (Pacific coast) appears on the left edge, and dashed
    gray lines represent state borders. Four contour labels are visible: "3000m" in
    the bottom-left (Sierra Nevada area), "4000m" in the center-right area, "5000m"
    near the Tetons peak, and "2000m" in the top-right. The colorbar legend on the
    right shows "Elevation (m)" with a scale from 1,000 to 6,000m. The title follows
    the correct format "contour-map-geographic · letsplot · pyplots.ai".'
