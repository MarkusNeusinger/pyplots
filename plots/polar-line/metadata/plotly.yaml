review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data choice: hourly temperature pattern is a perfect real-world use
    case for polar plots, demonstrating cyclical data visualization'
  - 'Proper loop closure: appending first value to close the polar shape is correctly
    implemented'
  - 'Good visual contrast: yellow vs dark blue colors are highly distinguishable and
    colorblind-safe'
  - 'Appropriate sizing: line width=4 and marker size=10 are well-suited for the data
    density'
  - Custom hover templates enhance interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The radial axis has both a title Temperature (°C) and ticksuffix=°C, creating
    slight redundancy in the center area
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like fill=toself for area between
    lines or animation frames
