review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of grouped violins using PolygonSeries with KDE calculation
  - Clean swarm algorithm with collision avoidance creates well-distributed points
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Realistic cognitive task response time scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a function definition (create_swarm_points) which violates KISS principle
    - should be inline code
  - Swarm points could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Legend symbols are small relative to the plot size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm point overlay
    showing response times (in milliseconds) across three task types: Pattern Match,
    Memory Recall, and Calculation. For each task type, two violin shapes are shown
    side-by-side representing Novice (dark blue, #306998) and Expert (yellow/gold,
    #FFD43B) groups. The violins have approximately 50% transparency, allowing the
    underlying swarm points (individual data points) to be visible within each violin.
    The swarm points are jittered horizontally to avoid overlap and have white edge
    highlighting. The title follows the required format "violin-grouped-swarm · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Response Times by Task Type and Expertise Level".
    The y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to about 5400ms. The x-axis
    shows "Task Type" with three categories. A legend in the upper right shows Novice
    and Expert with corresponding colors. The distributions show that Experts consistently
    have lower and tighter response time distributions compared to Novices, with Calculation
    showing the most dramatic difference. The plot uses a white background with subtle
    gray gridlines.'
