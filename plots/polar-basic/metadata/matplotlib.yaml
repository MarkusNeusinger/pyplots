review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of hourly temperature as a realistic application perfectly suited
    for polar visualization
  - Smart use of set_theta_zero_location("N") and clockwise direction for intuitive
    time reading (midnight at top)
  - Beautiful color scheme with blue points and contrasting yellow connecting line
  - Proper square format (12x12) for polar chart maintains circular proportions
  - Clean radial labels with temperature units (°C)
  - Well-implemented closed loop connecting first and last data points
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explanatory context - no subtitle or annotation explaining this is simulated
    daily temperature data
  - Could leverage more matplotlib polar features like fill_between for area emphasis
  image_description: The plot displays a polar chart showing hourly temperature patterns
    over a 24-hour cycle. The chart uses a circular coordinate system with time labels
    around the perimeter (12 AM at top, proceeding clockwise through 3 AM, 6 AM, 9
    AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM, 9 PM). Temperature is represented radially with concentric
    circles marked at 5°C, 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C. Data points are shown as blue
    (#306998) scatter points with white edges, connected by a yellow/gold (#FFD43B)
    line forming a closed loop. The pattern shows cooler temperatures (around 7-15°C)
    near midnight/early morning and warmer temperatures (around 18-23°C) in the afternoon,
    clearly demonstrating the expected diurnal temperature cycle. The title "Hourly
    Temperature Pattern · polar-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the
    top.

          data represents (no legend needed for single series, but context could be
          improved)
