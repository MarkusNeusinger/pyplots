review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including threshold lines with
    dashed styling
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types (:Q, :N)
  - Biologically realistic data generation with correlation between fold change and
    significance
  - Good use of Unicode subscripts in axis labels (Log₂, Log₁₀)
  - Proper color scheme distinguishing up-regulated (red), down-regulated (blue),
    and non-significant (gray)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use Altair interactive selection features for highlighting genes by category
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (e.g., using orange instead of
    red)
  image_description: 'The volcano plot displays a scatter plot with Log₂ Fold Change
    on the x-axis (ranging from -6 to 6) and -Log₁₀(p-value) on the y-axis (ranging
    from approximately 0.2 to 4.0). The title reads "volcano-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    in a clear font at the top. Three categories of points are displayed with appropriate
    colors: red/coral for Up-regulated genes (on the right side), blue for Down-regulated
    genes (on the left side), and gray for Not Significant genes (in the center).
    Two vertical dashed threshold lines are positioned at ±1 log2 fold change, and
    one horizontal dashed threshold line at approximately 1.3 (-log10(0.05)). The
    legend is positioned in the upper right corner showing "Significance" categories.
    The plot shows approximately 500 data points with good transparency (alpha) to
    handle overlapping points.'
