review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot geom_pie() with layer_labels() for percentage formatting
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette with Python Blue as the primary color
  - Proper use of theme_void() for clean pie chart presentation
  - Correct title format and legend configuration
  - Well-structured, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No slice explosion for emphasis on key slice as suggested in spec notes
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with pie shifted left relative to legend
