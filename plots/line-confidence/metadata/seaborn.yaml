review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements (24/20/16pt)
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: shows central line with shaded confidence band exactly
    as specified'
  - Realistic data scenario (monthly sales forecast) with growing uncertainty over
    time
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of contrasting but related colors (dark blue line, light blue band)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between instead of seaborn native confidence interval features
    (sns.lineplot can compute CI automatically from raw data)
  - Legend position slightly overlaps with early confidence band data
  image_description: The plot displays a 24-month sales forecast with a 95% confidence
    interval. A dark blue (#306998) solid line shows the central forecast trend, exhibiting
    an upward trajectory with clear seasonal oscillations. The forecast is surrounded
    by a semi-transparent light blue shaded band representing the confidence interval,
    which visibly widens as months progress (demonstrating growing uncertainty over
    time). The title "line-confidence · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is positioned at the
    top. The X-axis is labeled "Month" (ranging 0-25), and the Y-axis is labeled "Sales
    (Units)" (ranging approximately 80-200). A legend in the upper left corner identifies
    the confidence interval and forecast line. Subtle dashed grid lines aid readability.

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot and sns.set_style, but fill_between is matplotlib.
          Could use seaborn's native confidence interval support (e.g., sns.lineplot
          with ci parameter or sns.regplot)
  verdict: APPROVED
