review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of parallel categories using plotnine's polygon
    and rect geoms as building blocks
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-balanced layout and appropriate use of
    transparency for ribbons
  - Realistic customer journey scenario with meaningful data that demonstrates the
    plot type's purpose
  - Smooth curved ribbons using cubic interpolation create an elegant flow visualization
  - Good color scheme (Python blue/yellow) that is colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Title format deviates from spec by prepending "Customer Journey" instead of using
    pure "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" format
  - Category labels for middle dimensions (Product, Customer) are not displayed beside
    nodes, only counts shown inside
  - Some ribbon crossings create visual complexity that could be reduced by reordering
    categories
