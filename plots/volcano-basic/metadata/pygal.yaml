review:
  strengths:
  - Clean three-category color coding (gray/red/blue) clearly distinguishes significance
    groups
  - Good use of pygal custom Style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Realistic gene expression data scenario with proper statistical distributions
  - Tooltips include gene names for interactivity in HTML output
  - Proper scientific notation in axis labels (subscript formatting)
  weaknesses:
  - Threshold lines (horizontal at p=0.05, vertical at FC=±2) are not visible in the
    rendered output despite being coded
  - Y-axis range extends to -5 when all data is positive (0 to ~4), wasting half the
    vertical canvas
  - Legend positioned in top-left corner instead of near the data or at bottom as
    configured
  - Red/blue color scheme is not colorblind-safe; consider using colorblind-friendly
    palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a volcano plot with the title "volcano-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The X-axis shows "Log₂ Fold Change" ranging
    from -5 to 5, and the Y-axis shows "-Log₁₀(p-value)" ranging from -5 to 5. Data
    points are scattered across the plot in three colors: gray points (Not Significant)
    clustered near the center around x=0 with low y-values (0-1.5), blue points (Down-regulated)
    in the upper-left quadrant around x=-2.5 to -3.5 with y-values of 2-3.5, and red
    points (Up-regulated) in the upper-right quadrant around x=1.5 to 3.5 with y-values
    of 1.5-4. A legend appears in the top-left corner showing "Not Significant", "Up-regulated",
    and "Down-regulated". The plot has subtle grid lines. Notably, threshold lines
    specified in the spec (horizontal at y=1.3 and vertical at x=±1) are NOT visible
    in the rendered output despite being coded.'
