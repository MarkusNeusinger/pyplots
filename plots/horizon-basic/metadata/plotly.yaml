review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizon chart implementation with proper band folding technique showing
    positive (blue) and negative (red) values
  - Good use of subplots for multiple series comparison with shared x-axis
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color intensity progression (light to dark)
    for magnitude encoding
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic server CPU monitoring scenario with 6 servers over 24 hours
  - Good legend annotation explaining color interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Series labels (Server A-F) could be larger for better readability at full resolution
  - X-axis tick font size (16) is slightly below optimal for 4800x2700 output
  - Color legend annotation text is small and could be more prominent
