review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layering (geom_col +
    geom_errorbar)
  - Error bars have visible caps (width=0.25) as required by spec
  - Caption explains what error bars represent (95% CI) per spec requirements
  - Proper category ordering preserved with pd.Categorical
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Good color contrast between blue bars and dark error bars
  weaknesses:
  - Caption appears slightly cut off on right edge
  - Alternating blue/yellow colors do not convey meaning - single color or meaningful
    color mapping would be cleaner
  - Only symmetric error bars shown (spec mentions asymmetric may be needed for some
    cases)
