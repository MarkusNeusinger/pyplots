review:
  strengths:
  - Correct mathematical implementation of Skew-T transformation with 45° isotherms
  - Proper logarithmic pressure axis with inverted orientation (surface at bottom)
  - All required reference lines present (dry adiabat, moist adiabat, mixing ratio,
    isotherms)
  - Good color coding differentiating temperature, dewpoint, and reference line types
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with correct temperature/dewpoint relationship
  - Clean axis labels with proper units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered output despite being configured - critical
    for understanding the multiple overlapping lines
  - Cannot use pygal native Skew-T (it does not exist) so this is an XY approximation
    - acceptable given library limitations
  - Some reference lines (especially the thin dashed ones) are subtle and could be
    more visible
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram rendered
    using pygal''s XY chart. The Y-axis shows pressure levels (1000 hPa at bottom
    to 100 hPa at top) with logarithmic spacing correctly inverted. The X-axis shows
    "Temperature (°C, skewed 45°)". The main temperature profile is shown as a solid
    red line with markers running from surface (~25°C at 1000 hPa) to stratosphere
    (~-55°C at 100 hPa). The dewpoint profile is shown as a dashed blue line with
    markers, consistently cooler than temperature. Reference lines include: a green
    dashed dry adiabat (θ=300K), a purple dashed moist adiabat, an orange mixing ratio
    line (r=10g/kg), and two gray diagonal isotherms (0°C and -20°C) demonstrating
    the 45° skew. The title correctly uses the "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai"
    format. The background is light gray (#f8f9fa). CRITICAL ISSUE: The legend is
    not visible in the rendered image, despite the code having legend_at_bottom=True
    - this appears to be cut off or hidden.'
