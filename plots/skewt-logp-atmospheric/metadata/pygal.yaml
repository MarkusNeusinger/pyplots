review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with physically plausible temperature and
    dewpoint profiles
  - Good understanding of Skew-T transformation mathematics in the code
  - Clean colorblind-safe color scheme for main temperature and dewpoint profiles
  - Custom style defined for meteorological theme
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis displays abstract log values (0-1) instead of actual pressure levels (100-1000
    hPa) as required by spec
  - Reference lines (dry adiabats, moist adiabats, mixing ratio lines) are defined
    in code but not visibly rendered in the output - only temperature, dewpoint, and
    some isotherms appear
  - Legend shows only 5 items when 17+ series were added to the chart, indicating
    rendering or configuration issues
  - Font sizes appear small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas despite custom style
    definition
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram rendered with pygal. The chart has a light blue-gray plot background (#f0f4f8) with a white overall background. The Y-axis shows "Altitude (log scale)" ranging from 0 to 1 (representing log10(1000/pressure)), with the surface (1000 hPa) at the bottom and upper atmosphere at the top. The X-axis shows "Temperature (°C, skewed)" ranging from -40 to 70.

    Two main profiles are visible: a red temperature line with dot markers showing the atmospheric temperature profile, and a blue dewpoint line also with markers. Both profiles follow the characteristic Skew-T pattern where temperatures skew to the right with altitude. Three diagonal dotted gray lines representing isotherms (-40°C, -20°C, 0°C) are visible, tilted at approximately 45 degrees as required for Skew-T diagrams.

    The title "skewt-logp-atmospheric · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The legend is positioned at the bottom showing "Temperature", "Dewpoint", "-40°C", "-20°C", and "0°C". Text is generally legible but the font sizes appear somewhat small relative to the canvas. The Y-axis label incorrectly says "Altitude (log scale)" instead of "Pressure (hPa, log scale)" as specified in the code.
