review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PDP with comprehensive visualization including ICE
    lines, confidence band, and rug plot
  - Clean code structure using sklearn partial_dependence for proper ML interpretation
  - Professional color scheme with yellow main line contrasting against blue uncertainty
    elements
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with layered geoms
  - Good choice of realistic weather-related feature names for the regression context
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the different plot elements (main PDP line, ICE lines,
    confidence band)
  - The rug plot is very subtle and may be hard to see; could use slightly taller
    segments
  image_description: The plot displays a Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) for the "Temperature
    (standardized)" feature. The main PDP line is rendered in bright yellow/gold color
    showing the average predicted outcome increasing from approximately -25 to +40
    as temperature increases from -2.5 to 2.5. Multiple light blue ICE (Individual
    Conditional Expectation) lines are shown fanning out behind the main line, creating
    a confidence envelope effect. A light blue shaded region (80% confidence band)
    covers the range from approximately -175 to +175. A subtle rug plot is visible
    along the bottom near y=0 showing the distribution of training data. The title
    "pdp-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axes are clearly labeled
    with "Temperature (standardized)" on x-axis and "Partial Dependence (predicted
    outcome)" on y-axis.

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_ribbon, geom_line, geom_segment,
