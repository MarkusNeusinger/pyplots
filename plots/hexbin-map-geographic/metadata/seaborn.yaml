review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn jointplot for hexbin visualization - very idiomatic
  - Well-designed synthetic data with realistic NYC clustering patterns (Manhattan,
    Downtown, Brooklyn)
  - Good geographic context through simplified map overlays and annotations
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principle
  - Appropriate colormap choice (YlOrRd) with proper colorbar
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format should start with spec-id: hexbin-map-geographic · seaborn · pyplots.ai
    not NYC Taxi Pickups'
  - Some low-density peripheral hexagons are quite faint and hard to see
  image_description: 'The plot shows a hexagonal binning map of NYC taxi pickup locations
    using seaborn''s jointplot with kind="hex". The main visualization displays hexagons
    colored with a YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red) colormap on a light blue water-like
    background. Two distinct high-density clusters are visible: one in Midtown Manhattan
    (around latitude 40.78, longitude -73.97) and another in the Financial District/Downtown
    area (around latitude 40.71, longitude -74.01). Simplified geographic context
    is provided through blue line segments representing water boundaries (Hudson River,
    East River) and rounded rectangles outlining Manhattan and Brooklyn areas. Text
    annotations label "Manhattan", "Brooklyn", and "Hudson River" in appropriate colors.
    Marginal histograms on the top and right edges show the univariate distributions
    of longitude and latitude respectively. A colorbar on the right shows the "Pickup
    Count" scale ranging from approximately 20 to 180. The title follows the required
    format: "NYC Taxi Pickups · hexbin-map-geographic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axis
    labels include degree symbols: "Longitude (°W)" and "Latitude (°N)".'

        comment: Excellent use of seaborn's jointplot with kind=hex - this is seaborn's
          idiomatic approach for 2D density/hexbin visualization, includes marginal
          histograms automatically, uses sns.set_theme for consistent styling
