review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with properly sized text elements following the
    library guidelines exactly
  - Realistic data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that demonstrates clear correlation
    with appropriate noise
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seaborn axes-level API usage
  - Good use of alpha transparency and white edge colors to handle point overlap
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage seaborn distinctive statistical features (e.g., regplot, jointplot,
    or hue parameter for additional dimension)
  - Marker size s=200 is at the upper end of the recommended range for 150 points
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D scatter plot with 150 blue circular markers
    (#306998 color) with white edge borders. The X-axis shows "Study Hours (per week)"
    ranging from approximately 1 to 10, and the Y-axis shows "Exam Score (points)"
    ranging from about 10 to 120. The title correctly follows the format "scatter-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The data demonstrates a clear positive linear correlation
    between study hours and exam scores with realistic noise/variance. Points have
    moderate transparency (alpha 0.7) allowing overlapping points to be distinguished.
    Subtle dashed grid lines (alpha 0.3) aid in value estimation. The layout is well-balanced
    with proper use of the 16:9 aspect ratio.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot which is basic seaborn. Could have used seaborn-specific
          features like regplot for regression line, or leveraged seaborn's statistical
          capabilities. Currently equivalent to matplotlib with seaborn styling.
  verdict: APPROVED
