review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of Chernoff faces with clear differentiation between
    car types
  - Well-implemented feature mappings with 7 distinct facial attributes
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each car
  - Comprehensive legend explaining feature mappings
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Clean horizontal layout with proper spacing
  - Both PNG and HTML output for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Color legend at bottom is redundant since car names are already labeled below
    each face
  - Some unused vertical space at the bottom of the canvas could be better utilized
  - Faces could be slightly larger to better fill the available canvas space
  image_description: The plot displays 5 Chernoff faces arranged horizontally representing
    car performance metrics (Sedan A, SUV B, Sports C, Compact D, Luxury E). Each
    face is rendered as a colored ellipse (blue, yellow, teal, coral, purple respectively)
    with semi-transparent fill and solid outline. Faces contain white eyes with dark
    pupils, eyebrows with varied slants, vertical nose lines of different lengths,
    and curved mouths (smiling/frowning). Below each face is a bold label with the
    car name. The title "Car Performance Comparison · chernoff-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top center. A feature mappings legend explains the 7 attribute mappings
    (Face Width = Engine Power, etc.) arranged in two rows. A color legend at bottom
    identifies each car by its color swatch. The layout uses a white background with
    good spacing between elements.

        comment: Uses pygal for SVG infrastructure and custom style, then extends
          with custom SVG elements for Chernoff faces. Creative approach but pygal
          itself cannot render Chernoff faces natively, so this is a hybrid solution.
  verdict: APPROVED
