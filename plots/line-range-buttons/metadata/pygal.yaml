review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the range selector concept using composite image approach
  - Clean visual design with proper button highlighting and range indicator overlay
  - Interactive HTML version provides full functionality with working range buttons
  - Mini chart navigator effectively shows full data range with semi-transparent selection
    indicator
  - Good use of pygal style customization for consistent typography
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position at top-left appears slightly detached from the main chart area
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart titled "line-range-buttons
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" showing daily values from December 2024 to December 2025
    (1Y range). The main chart occupies the upper portion with a blue line (#306998)
    tracking values between approximately 112-145. The y-axis is labeled "Value" and
    the x-axis is labeled "Date" with monthly labels (Dec '24, Feb '25, Apr '25, Jun
    '25, Aug '25, Oct '25, Dec '25). A "Daily Values" legend appears at the top-left.
    Below the main chart is a range selector button bar with "Range:" label and six
    buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) where "1Y" is highlighted in blue indicating
    the active selection. At the bottom is a "Range Navigator — Full History" mini
    chart showing the complete 2-year dataset (Jan '24 to Dec '25) with a light blue
    semi-transparent overlay indicating the currently selected 1Y range. The overall
    layout is clean with white background and subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Uses pygal SVG rendering, custom Style configuration, and interactive
          HTML export; PIL compositing is creative but not leveraging more native
          pygal interactive capabilities
