review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with proper font sizes and element visibility
  - Clear demonstration of Q-Q plot concept with visible deviation from normality
  - Correct title format and axis labeling per specification
  - Good use of Python blue (#306998) and contrasting yellow for reference line
  - White edge borders on scatter points improve visibility
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Uses complex manual inverse normal CDF approximation (Abramowitz & Stegun) instead
    of scipy.stats.norm.ppf - adds unnecessary code complexity
  - Grid/legend section could be improved with legend placed outside plot area or
    better positioned
  image_description: The plot displays a Q-Q plot comparing sample quantiles against
    theoretical (normal) quantiles. Points are rendered as blue circles (#306998)
    with white edges, sized appropriately (s=200) with alpha=0.7 transparency. A yellow
    dashed reference line (y=x) runs diagonally across the plot. The x-axis is labeled
    "Theoretical Quantiles" and ranges from approximately -2.5 to 2.5. The y-axis
    is labeled "Sample Quantiles" with the same range. The title reads "qq-basic ·
    matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. A legend in the upper left identifies
    the reference line. The plot clearly shows the data's right skew through deviation
    from the reference line at higher quantiles, with points falling below the line
    in the upper-right region. The grid is subtle with alpha=0.3 and dashed styling.
