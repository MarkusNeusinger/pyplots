review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with three distinct frequency peaks clearly visible
  - Proper use of dB scale for amplitude representation as specified
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar with geom_line and geom_area combination
  - Realistic signal processing data with fundamental, harmonics, and noise
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Good use of lets-plot theme customization for text sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could benefit from slightly more transparency (alpha currently at 0.3 which
    is acceptable but on the higher end)
  - HTML output path handling could be cleaner (uses path="." parameter)
  image_description: The plot displays a frequency spectrum with three prominent peaks
    at 50 Hz (~54 dB), 120 Hz (~48 dB), and 200 Hz (~44 dB), corresponding to the
    signal components defined in the code. A blue line traces the amplitude across
    the frequency range (0-300 Hz), with a semi-transparent light blue area fill underneath.
    The noise floor fluctuates around 5-15 dB with realistic variation. The title
    "spectrum-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Axis labels
    clearly show "Frequency (Hz)" and "Amplitude (dB)". The grid uses subtle gray
    lines. Overall layout is well-balanced with the plot filling the canvas appropriately.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (geom_line + geom_area), theme_minimal, and proper
          ggsize/ggsave with scale parameter; could leverage more lets-plot specific
          features like tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
