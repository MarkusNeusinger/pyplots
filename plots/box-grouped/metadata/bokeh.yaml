review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text elements (36pt title, 28pt labels,
    22pt ticks)
  - Clean implementation of grouped box plots with proper spacing between subcategories
  - Good color palette (Python Blue, Python Yellow, Teal) that is colorblind-accessible
  - 'Proper statistical box plot components: median, quartiles, whiskers at 1.5×IQR,
    and outliers'
  - Realistic HR scenario with meaningful data variations across departments and experience
    levels
  - Correct title format and well-placed legend
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function calc_boxplot_stats slightly deviates from KISS principle (though
    understandable for box plots)
  - One outlier value (105) slightly exceeds typical 100-point performance scale
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific interactive features (HoverTool would enhance
    the plot)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot comparing employee performance
    scores across 4 departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing, Support) with 3 experience
    levels (Junior in blue #306998, Senior in yellow #FFD43B, Lead in teal #4ECDC4).
    Each department shows 3 side-by-side box plots with clear median lines, IQR boxes,
    whiskers extending to 1.5×IQR, and outliers displayed as colored circles. The
    title "box-grouped · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend on the
    right side clearly identifies the subcategories. The grid uses subtle dashed lines
    with low alpha. Notable outliers appear in Engineering Lead (~38, ~58) and Support
    Lead (~65-69). The y-axis ranges from 30-110 showing Performance Score, and all
    text is clearly readable.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, figure with proper categorical x_range, vbar
          for boxes, segment for whiskers. Good usage but could leverage more Bokeh-specific
          features like HoverTool for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
