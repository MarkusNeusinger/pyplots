review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn's PairGrid for creating a polished scatter matrix
  - Appropriate disclaimer about static limitations vs interactive libraries
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - KDE plots on diagonal provide clear univariate distributions
  - Well-formatted axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Tick label font size (14pt) could be slightly larger for the 3600x3600 canvas
  - Legend marker scale could be increased for better visibility at this canvas size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) of the Iris
    dataset with four numeric variables: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal
    Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). The three species are color-coded: setosa in
    blue (#306998), versicolor in yellow (#FFD43B), and virginica in green (#4DAF4A).
    Off-diagonal cells show scatter plots with circular markers (s=80, alpha=0.7)
    with white edges. Diagonal cells display KDE (kernel density estimation) plots
    showing univariate distributions for each species, filled with transparency. The
    title "scatter-matrix-interactive · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold, with an italic subtitle noting the static nature. A legend is positioned
    to the right outside the plot area. All axis labels include units (cm). Grid lines
    are subtle (alpha=0.2, dashed).'
