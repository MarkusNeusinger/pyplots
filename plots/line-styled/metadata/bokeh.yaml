review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for the 4800×2700 canvas with 48pt title and 36pt axis labels
  - All four line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot) are clearly distinguishable
    as required by spec
  - Clean code structure with well-organized ColumnDataSource
  - Good use of markers on data points to enhance visibility
  - Legend is well-formatted with appropriate sizing and semi-transparent background
  weaknesses:
  - Grid uses dashed style which can visually compete with the dashed line series
    - consider solid grid with lower alpha
  - Could add HoverTool for interactivity to better leverage Bokeh's strengths
  - Data scenario is somewhat generic - Monthly performance metrics could be more
    specific
