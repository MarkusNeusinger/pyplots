review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_pie with hole parameter for native donut chart creation
  - Clean center annotation using geom_label showing total budget
  - Well-formatted percentage labels using layer_labels().format()
  - Colorblind-safe palette with Python blue as primary color
  - Proper categorical ordering to maintain consistent segment order
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart for better visual cohesion
  - No explicit random seed (though data is deterministic, best practice to include)
