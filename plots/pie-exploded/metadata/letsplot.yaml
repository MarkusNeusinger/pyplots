review:
  strengths:
  - Explosion effect is clearly visible with R&D (0.3) and Sales (0.2) noticeably
    separated
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color
  - Percentage labels are well-formatted and positioned on each slice
  - White stroke between slices provides good visual separation
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with meaningful data
  - Proper use of lets-plot geom_pie with explode aesthetic
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Pie chart is slightly left-of-center due to legend placement
