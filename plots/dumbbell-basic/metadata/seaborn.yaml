review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal dumbbell chart implementation following spec recommendations
    precisely
  - Data sorted by difference ascending effectively reveals the pattern of improvements
  - Color choice (blue/yellow) provides excellent contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario with plausible values
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments
  - Proper use of zorder to ensure dots appear above connecting lines
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features like sns.set_style() or seaborn
    color palettes
  - X-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., Employee Satisfaction Score instead
    of just Satisfaction Score)
