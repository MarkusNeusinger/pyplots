review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three targeted annotations (top performer, tightest/widest
    spread) using computed IQR values — these are data-driven, not hardcoded
  - 'Sophisticated styling: custom edge colors per box, path effects for depth, dashed
    whiskers, warm background'
  - Thorough feature coverage with varied distributions, deliberate outliers, and
    different sample sizes
  - Clean code structure with no deprecated API usage
  weaknesses:
  - The Top performer annotation is positioned slightly left of the Marketing box
    (at x=1.3), making the arrow reach awkwardly across from above the Engineering/Marketing
    gap — repositioning it directly above Marketing would be cleaner
  - Three annotations in the upper portion of the chart create some visual density
    that slightly crowds the top area
  image_description: 'The plot displays five notched box-and-whisker plots arranged
    horizontally, one for each department: Engineering (dark blue), Marketing (orange),
    Sales (purple), Support (green), and Design (teal). The X-axis is labeled "Department"
    and the Y-axis "Performance Score" ranging from approximately 10 to 108. Each
    box shows the interquartile range with a dark median line and a white diamond
    marker indicating the mean. Whiskers are rendered as dashed lines extending to
    the data range (1.5×IQR), with caps at the ends. Outlier points appear as gray
    circles (e.g., two low outliers for Engineering around 38 and 48, and low outliers
    for Sales around 22-25). The background is a warm off-white (#FAFAFA). Three styled
    annotations with fancy arrows and colored bounding boxes highlight: "Top performer
    — Median = 85" pointing to Marketing (orange box), "Tightest spread — IQR = 7.3"
    pointing to Marketing, and "Widest spread — IQR = 19.3" pointing to Sales. Top
    and right spines are removed; left and bottom spines are light gray. A subtle
    y-axis grid (very low alpha) provides reference lines. The title reads "box-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format.'
