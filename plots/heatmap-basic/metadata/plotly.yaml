review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-chosen font sizes for all elements
  - 'Perfect implementation of spec requirements: diverging colormap, cell annotations,
    and colorbar'
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal patterns visible in the data
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotly library guidelines exactly
  - Good use of RdBu_r colormap which is colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., "Product Category" instead of just
    "Category")
  - Colorbar title could include more context (e.g., "Monthly Sales ($K)")
  - Could leverage additional Plotly features like custom hover templates for enhanced
    interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a heatmap showing monthly sales data across
    8 product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Food, Books, Sports, Home, Beauty,
    Toys) for all 12 months (Jan-Dec). The heatmap uses a red-blue diverging colorscale
    (RdBu_r), where deep red indicates high values (~100+ $K) and deep blue indicates
    low values (near 0 or negative). Each cell contains a numeric annotation showing
    the exact value. The title "heatmap-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top. The x-axis shows "Month" and the y-axis shows "Category". A colorbar
    on the right indicates "Sales ($K)" with values ranging from approximately 0 to
    100. The layout is clean with good proportions, and all text is clearly readable.
