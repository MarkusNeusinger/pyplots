review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of depth-first search maze generation algorithm ensuring
    exactly one solution
  - Clean visual design with black walls on white background suitable for printing
  - Proper use of increasing sector count per ring for natural-looking circular maze
  - Good use of Plotly annotations for START arrow and labels
  - Appropriate square aspect ratio (1:1) for circular content
  - Entry gap and goal marker clearly marked
  weaknesses:
  - GOAL label appears slightly faded/light compared to START label
  - Some inner radial walls near the center appear thin relative to outer walls
  - Could add hover interactivity to show maze path or highlight solution (plotly
    strength)
  image_description: The plot shows a circular maze puzzle with 7 concentric rings
    and increasing sectors per ring (6 to 42). The maze uses black walls on a white
    background, creating a clean print-friendly appearance. The outer boundary forms
    a complete circle with a gap in the upper-right quadrant serving as the entry
    point. A blue "START" label with an arrow points to this entry. At the center
    is a blue filled circle with a yellow star marker, and a "GOAL" label appears
    below it (though it appears partially faded/light). The maze has a variety of
    radial and arc walls creating passages, generated using a depth-first search algorithm
    ensuring one solution path exists. The title "maze-circular · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    appears centered at the top.
