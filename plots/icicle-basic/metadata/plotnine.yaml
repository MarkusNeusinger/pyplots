review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships visible
    through spatial adjacency
  - 'Smart label handling: shows name+value for wide rectangles, name-only for medium,
    hidden for narrow'
  - Good color contrast between hierarchy levels with appropriate text colors (white
    on dark, black on light)
  - Proper bottom-up value aggregation for non-leaf nodes
  - Clean theme_void usage appropriate for this chart type
  - Well-implemented BFS algorithm for layout calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows Hierarchy Level with just numbers 0-3 instead of the more descriptive
    labels defined in the code
