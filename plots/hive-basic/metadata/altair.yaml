review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of hive plot concept using Altairs layered chart approach
  - Good color scheme with Python Blue, Yellow, and Teal that is colorblind-accessible
  - Appropriate use of transparency (opacity=0.35) for edges to handle overlapping
    connections
  - Realistic software dependency network scenario matching specification applications
  - 'Proper use of Altair features: layered composition, tooltips, mark types'
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels on Core axis are crowded and overlapping due to insufficient vertical
    spacing between nodes
  - Axis category labels (Core, Utility, Interface) not visible in rendered output
  - Legend panel not visible in final rendered image despite being created in code
  - Data mismatch between code (12 nodes) and rendered image (15 nodes including Events,
    Crypto, WebSocket) suggests synchronization issue
