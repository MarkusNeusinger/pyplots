review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layering (geom_col +
    geom_errorbar)
  - Error bars have visible caps (width=0.25) as required by spec
  - Caption explains what error bars represent (95% CI) per spec requirements
  - Proper category ordering preserved with pd.Categorical
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Good color contrast between blue bars and dark error bars
  weaknesses:
  - Caption appears slightly cut off on right edge
  - Alternating blue/yellow colors do not convey meaning - single color or meaningful
    color mapping would be cleaner
  - Only symmetric error bars shown (spec mentions asymmetric may be needed for some
    cases)
  image_description: The plot displays a bar chart with 6 survey categories on the
    x-axis (Product Quality, Customer Service, Delivery Speed, Price Value, Website
    UX, Return Policy) and satisfaction scores (1-5) on the y-axis. Bars alternate
    between Python blue (#306998) and gold (#FFD43B) colors. Each bar has black error
    bars with horizontal caps representing 95% confidence intervals. The title "bar-error
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top. Category labels are rotated
    ~25 degrees for readability. A caption "Error bars represent 95% CI" appears in
    italics at the bottom right. The layout uses a minimal theme with subtle horizontal
    grid lines only.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_col + geom_errorbar, pd.Categorical
          for ordering, theme customization. Could use scale_fill_brewer for more
          idiomatic palette usage.
  verdict: APPROVED
