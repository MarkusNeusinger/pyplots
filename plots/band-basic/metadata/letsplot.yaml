review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of band plot with proper geom_ribbon for confidence interval
  - Data shows increasing uncertainty over time (heteroscedasticity) which is realistic
    and educational
  - Perfect title format and axis labels with units
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines
  - Appropriate alpha (0.3) for band transparency as per spec recommendation
  - Correct use of 1600x900 base size with scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are solid gray rather than using subtle alpha for better visual subtlety
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive interactive features or tooltips
  image_description: The plot displays a band plot with a light blue semi-transparent
    filled region (confidence band) spanning from approximately -2 to 9 on the y-axis,
    covering the full x-axis range of 0 to 10 seconds. A darker blue central trend
    line follows a sinusoidal pattern with upward linear trend (sin wave superimposed
    on positive slope). The band width increases from left to right, illustrating
    growing uncertainty over time. The title "band-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. Axis labels show "Time (s)" on x-axis and "Value (units)"
    on y-axis. The background uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines. All
    text is clearly readable.

        comment: Uses basic geom_ribbon and geom_line, which are standard ggplot features.
          Could leverage lets_plot's tooltips, interactivity, or geom_smooth for more
          distinctive usage
  verdict: APPROVED
