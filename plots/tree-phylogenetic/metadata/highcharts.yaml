review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological accuracy with real primate species and realistic divergence
    times
  - Clean rectangular cladogram layout with proportional branch lengths
  - Colorblind-safe blue-yellow palette distinguishing taxonomic ranks from species
  - Scale bar properly implemented using Highcharts annotations
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced margins and readable species labels
  - Reversed x-axis correctly shows time going back from present (0) to past (80 MYA)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the meaning of different blue shades (taxonomic ranks)
  - Code uses helper function (assign_y_positions) instead of pure KISS flat structure
  - Grid lines for Y-axis are hidden but could show subtle reference lines
