review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing following the 24/20/16pt guideline for large canvas
  - Clean alternating color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of asymmetric error bars for percentage data as spec suggests
  - Good annotation explaining what error bars represent (95% CI)
  - Modern seaborn API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warnings
  - Y-axis correctly starts at 0 for proper bar comparison
  - Realistic A/B testing scenario with plausible conversion rate values
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars added via matplotlib errorbar() rather than exploring seaborn native
    statistical capabilities
  - The annotation box could be positioned closer to the data area rather than isolated
    in the corner
  - Feature coverage could show more variation (e.g., one notably different group
    or wider CI range)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart with 6 categories (Control, Variant
    A through E) on the x-axis and Conversion Rate (%) on the y-axis ranging from
    0 to ~7.5%. Bars alternate between dark blue (#306998) and golden yellow (#FFD43B)
    colors. Each bar has black error bars with visible caps extending vertically to
    show 95% confidence intervals. The title "bar-error · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is
    prominently displayed at the top in bold. An annotation box in the upper right
    corner explains "Error bars: 95% CI". A subtle horizontal dashed grid is visible
    behind the bars. The layout is clean with good proportions and all text is clearly
    legible.'
