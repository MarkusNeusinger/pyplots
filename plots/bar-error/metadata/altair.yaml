review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered composition with separate marks for bars, error
    lines, and caps
  - Clear annotation explaining what error bars represent (±1 SD) as required by spec
  - Realistic scientific context with treatment comparison data
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with appropriate font sizes
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No tooltips for interactivity - Altair strength is interactive visualization
  - Only symmetric error bars shown; asymmetric example would demonstrate fuller feature
    coverage
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bar chart with 5 blue bars (#306998) representing
    treatment groups: Control, Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, and Combination. The x-axis
    is labeled "Treatment Group" and the y-axis "Response Rate (%)" with a scale from
    0-100. Each bar features black error bars with clearly visible caps at both top
    and bottom ends. The title "bar-error · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top. An annotation "Error bars: ±1 SD" is positioned in the upper right corner.
    The background has subtle gray gridlines (alpha 0.3), and all text elements are
    clearly readable with appropriate font sizes.'

        comment: Good use of layered chart composition (bars + error_bars + caps +
          annotation), but could add interactivity with tooltips
