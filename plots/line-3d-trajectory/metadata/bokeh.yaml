review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of Lorenz attractor data demonstrating chaotic trajectory
  - Color gradient effectively shows time progression along the path
  - Custom 3D axis rendering with arrows provides good spatial orientation
  - Good use of Bokeh multi_line for per-segment coloring
  - Clean projection math for 3D to 2D isometric view
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a function definition (lorenz_step) violating KISS principle - should
    inline the Euler integration
  - Colorbar title text appears small and is rotated vertically
  - Custom axes only labeled with single letters (X, Y, Z) without descriptive context
  - Some empty space on the left side of the plot could be better balanced
  image_description: The plot displays a Lorenz attractor trajectory projected from
    3D to 2D using isometric projection. The famous butterfly-wing shape is clearly
    visible with two spiral lobes. The trajectory line is color-coded using the Viridis
    colormap (dark purple to yellow) to show time progression from start (0) to end
    (1). Custom 3D axes (X, Y, Z) with arrow heads are drawn at the projected origin,
    providing spatial orientation. A colorbar labeled "Time Progression" appears on
    the right side. The background is light gray (#f9f9f9) with subtle dashed grid
    lines. The title reads "Lorenz Attractor · line-3d-trajectory · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    at the top left.
