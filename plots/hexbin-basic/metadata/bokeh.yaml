review:
  strengths:
  - Cohesive dark Viridis design where background color (#440154) matches the colormap
    low end, creating seamless density visualization
  - Expert use of Bokeh native hex API chain (hexbin, hex_tile, linear_cmap, construct_color_bar)
  - All chrome removed (spines, grid, ticks, outline) for a polished minimal aesthetic
  - Descriptive axis labels with units in a realistic environmental monitoring context
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Color bar slightly thin and cramped at right canvas edge
  - Data storytelling could be stronger with more cluster variation or overlapping
    density regions
  - Environmental sensor context is plausible but generic
  improvements: []
  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning density visualization
    on a deep purple (#440154) background that matches the lowest end of the Viridis
    colormap. Three distinct clusters of hexagonal bins are visible: a bottom-left
    cluster centered around (-3, -1) with a bright yellow core fading through green
    and teal to purple edges; a smaller, tighter top-center cluster around (-1, 4)
    with concentrated green-yellow hexagons; and a larger, more diffuse right cluster
    around (3, 1) with green centers spreading broadly. The Viridis colormap transitions
    from dark purple (0 count) through blue/teal/green to bright yellow (~140 count).
    A vertical color bar on the right is labeled "Count" with values 0-140. The title
    "hexbin-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in white at the top-left. Axis labels
    read "Distance East (km)" and "Distance North (km)" in white, with light gray
    tick labels. No grid lines, axis lines, or tick marks are present — the design
    is minimal and polished.'
