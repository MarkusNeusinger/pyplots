review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual KDE implementation using Silverman's rule of thumb for bandwidth
    selection
  - Rug plot nicely shows individual observations as recommended in spec
  - Bimodal distribution effectively demonstrates density plot's ability to reveal
    distribution characteristics
  - Good use of Plotly's interactive features (hover templates, HTML export)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800×2700px output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label "Test Score" could include units for full VQ-06 credit
  - Could use more specific realistic context (e.g., "SAT Math Scores" instead of
    generic "Test Score")
  - Does not leverage Plotly's built-in density/histogram functions (ff.create_distplot
    or histogram with histnorm)
