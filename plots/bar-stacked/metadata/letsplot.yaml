review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing throughout - all labels are clearly readable at the target
    resolution
  - Clean, professional color scheme starting with Python Blue (#306998)
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with appropriate theming
  - Well-structured data showing realistic quarterly sales progression
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  - Good bar spacing (width=0.7) and transparency (alpha=0.9) for visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color combination (Clothing/Accessories) may cause accessibility issues
    for colorblind users - consider using colorblind-safe palette
  - Missing total value labels above each stack as suggested in specification notes
  - Legend could benefit from a subtle background/border for better visual separation
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltips in the HTML output for enhanced
    user experience
