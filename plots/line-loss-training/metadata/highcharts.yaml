review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent overfitting visualization with clear divergence between training and
    validation curves after epoch 28
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between blue training line and yellow
    validation line
  - Informative subtitle showing optimal stopping point with precise validation loss
    value
  - Well-scaled markers and line widths appropriate for 50 data points
  - Proper use of Highcharts LineSeries with distinct marker symbols (circle vs square)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper right slightly crowds the visual area where the curves
    begin; positioning at right-middle or bottom would be cleaner
  - 'Grid lines could be more subtle (current gridLineColor #e0e0e0 is visible but
    acceptable)'
  image_description: 'The plot displays two line curves on a white background showing
    training loss (blue with circle markers) and validation loss (yellow/gold with
    square markers) over 50 epochs. The title "line-loss-training · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle indicating "Optimal stopping: Epoch
    29 (Val Loss: 0.694)". The Y-axis is labeled "Cross-Entropy Loss" ranging from
    0 to 2.8, and the X-axis is labeled "Epoch" ranging from 0 to 50. A legend in
    the upper right corner clearly identifies both series. Both curves start high
    (~2.5-2.65) and decay exponentially, with the validation loss showing clear overfitting
    behavior after approximately epoch 28 where it begins to increase while training
    loss continues to decrease.'
