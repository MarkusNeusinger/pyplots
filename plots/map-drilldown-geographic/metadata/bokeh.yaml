review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: CustomJS for drill-down interaction,
    TapTool, HoverTool with tooltips, ColumnDataSource pattern'
  - Well-structured hierarchical data with 3 levels (countries → US states → California
    cities)
  - Clean breadcrumb navigation implementation with clickable segments
  - Appropriate color palette (Blues9) that is colorblind-safe
  - Good instruction text explaining the interaction model
  weaknesses:
  - Country name labels and value labels are not visible in the static PNG export
    - the text glyphs exist in code but do not render visibly (may need larger font
    sizes or contrasting colors)
  - Color bar legend title is too small to read comfortably
  - The color bar appears slightly cramped against the right edge of the figure
  image_description: The plot displays a hierarchical geographic map of the Americas
    with 5 countries (Canada, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina) represented
    as simplified rectangular polygons. Countries are filled with shades of blue from
    a choropleth color scale based on sales values. The title "map-drilldown-geographic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. A breadcrumb navigation "📍
    World" is shown in the top-left corner with a light gray background. The right
    side has a color bar legend labeled "Sales ($M)" ranging from 0 to 800. Axes display
    Longitude (x-axis, -140 to -40) and Latitude (y-axis, -60 to 60+). An instruction
    note at the bottom reads "Click on a region to drill down into its subdivisions."
    The background is a light blue (#f0f8ff). Country labels (names and values) that
    exist in the code are NOT visible in the rendered static PNG output.
