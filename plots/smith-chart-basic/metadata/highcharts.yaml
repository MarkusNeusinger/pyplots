review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Smith chart implementation with proper RF engineering context and terminology
  - Complete grid with constant resistance circles and constant reactance arcs
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between elements
  - Frequency labels as boxed annotations along the impedance curve provide valuable
    context
  - VSWR circles add useful engineering reference
  - High-resolution 3600x3600 square format appropriate for circular chart
  - Proper impedance normalization and reflection coefficient calculation
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (resistance_circle, reactance_arc) instead of inline
    code, violating KISS principle
  - Y-axis range extends to ±1.5 when ±1.2 would be sufficient, causing some wasted
    whitespace
  - Legend at bottom is somewhat cramped and could be better positioned
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance visualization with a square 1:1 aspect ratio layout. The chart shows:
    - Title: "smith-chart-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top in bold black text
    - Subtitle: "Antenna Impedance Sweep 1-6 GHz (Z₀ = 50Ω)" below the title
    - Unit Circle: A solid dark gray circle marking |Γ| = 1 (the boundary of total reflection)
    - Resistance Circles: Blue dotted circles (R=0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) centered along the horizontal axis
    - Reactance Arcs: Gold/tan dotted arcs (X=±0.2, ±0.5, ±1, ±2) curving from the right edge
    - VSWR Circles: Three dashed concentric circles in purple, cyan, and brown for VSWR=1.5, 2.0, 3.0
    - Matched Point: A green diamond marker at the center (0,0) representing Z=Z₀
    - Impedance Locus: A red connected curve with circular markers showing the frequency sweep trajectory from 1-6 GHz
    - Frequency Labels: Boxed annotations at 1.0, 2.3, 3.6, 4.8, and 6.0 GHz along the impedance curve
    - Axes: Real(Γ) on x-axis and Imag(Γ) on y-axis, ranging from -1.2 to 1.2
    - Legend: Positioned at bottom showing VSWR values, Matched point, and Impedance Locus series
    - Colors: Colorblind-safe palette with blue, gold, red, purple, cyan, brown, green
