review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn boxplot with notch parameter and proper API (hue with
    legend=False)
  - Realistic salary data scenario that naturally demonstrates notch interpretation
  - Clear visual differentiation between departments with accessible color palette
  - Thoughtful annotation explaining notch interpretation for educational value
  - Properly formatted y-axis with dollar values and K suffix for readability
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid/legend scoring ambiguity: no legend present but this is correct for the
    plot type'
