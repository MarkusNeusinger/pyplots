  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with realistic European energy mix showing diverse
    compositions (nuclear-heavy France vs coal-heavy Poland)
  - Smart percentage label placement only for segments >=8%, avoiding clutter
  - Good color contrast with white edge separators between segments
  - Proper normalization to 100% with clear visual communication
  - Title format correctly includes spec-id and library
  weaknesses:
  - No distinctive matplotlib features used (hatching, custom annotations, or advanced
    styling could enhance)
  - Legend frame adds slight visual weight that could be removed for cleaner look
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing the European
    energy mix for 6 countries (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Poland). Each bar
    is divided into 5 colored segments representing energy sources: Renewables (Python
    blue #306998), Nuclear (golden yellow #FFD43B), Natural Gas (green #50C878), Coal
    (crimson red #DC143C), and Other (purple #9370DB). Percentage labels appear within
    segments that are ≥8%, using white text on dark backgrounds and black text on
    light backgrounds. The title reads "European Energy Mix · bar-stacked-percent
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. The legend is positioned outside the plot
    area to the upper right. A subtle horizontal grid at y=0, 25, 50, 75, 100 aids
    reading. The country names appear below each bar on the x-axis, with "Country"
    as the axis label and "Percentage (%)" on the y-axis.'
