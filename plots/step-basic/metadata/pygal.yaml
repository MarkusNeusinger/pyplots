review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step visualization technique using intermediate points with zero-width
    space labels
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate font scaling for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Perfect real-world scenario (cumulative monthly sales) that naturally fits step
    plots
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent branding
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears somewhat small and isolated from the main chart area
  - Could show more dramatic variation in step heights to better demonstrate the plot
    type utility
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart showing cumulative monthly sales
    throughout the year. It uses a blue line (#306998) with circular markers at each
    data point, creating a clear stair-step pattern. The title "step-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a readable font. The Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative
    Sales ($K)" ranging from approximately 50 to 635, and the X-axis shows "Month"
    with all 12 month abbreviations (Jan-Dec). Horizontal grid lines help trace values.
    A legend at the bottom identifies the series as "Cumulative Sales". The background
    is clean white with good contrast.

          but somewhat isolated from the plot.

        comment: Uses pygal's Style customization and Line chart effectively. The
          workaround for step visualization using intermediate points is clever but
          pygal doesn't have native step chart support.
  verdict: APPROVED
