review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of damped harmonic oscillator phase portrait with clear
    spiral convergence to equilibrium
  - Effective use of color gradient to show time evolution (blue to yellow)
  - Well-marked start and end points with distinct markers (circle and square)
  - Reference lines at x=0 and dx/dt=0 help identify equilibrium and zero-crossing
    points
  - Clean, professional appearance with proper plotnine grammar of graphics implementation
  - Mathematically correct derivative calculation for damped oscillator
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include physical units (e.g., Position x (m), Velocity dx/dt
    (m/s))
  - Only single trajectory shown; spec notes that multiple trajectories from different
    initial conditions could reveal basin of attraction structure
  image_description: The plot shows a phase diagram (state space plot) displaying
    a damped harmonic oscillator trajectory. The visualization features a spiral pattern
    starting from the outer edge (at position x≈2, velocity≈0) and spiraling inward
    towards the origin (equilibrium point). The color gradient transitions from dark
    blue (early time t=0) through greenish tones to yellow (later time t≈8), clearly
    showing the time evolution. A dark blue circular marker indicates the starting
    point, and a yellow square marker shows the endpoint near the origin. Dashed reference
    lines mark the x=0 and dx/dt=0 axes. The title "phase-diagram · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Axis labels show "Position x" and "Velocity dx/dt". A colorbar
    legend on the right shows "Time (s)" ranging from 0 to 8. The background is clean
    with subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Good use of plotnine grammar (ggplot, aes, geom_path, scale_color_gradient,
          theme customization), but could leverage more advanced features like annotations
          or faceting
  verdict: APPROVED
