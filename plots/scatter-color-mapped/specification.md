# scatter-color-mapped: Color-Mapped Scatter Plot

## Description

A scatter plot that encodes a third continuous variable using a colormap, allowing visualization of three dimensions on a 2D plane. This visualization is essential for exploring multivariate relationships where the third variable represents intensity, magnitude, or any continuous measurement. A colorbar provides a reference scale for interpreting the color values.

## Applications

- Visualizing temperature distribution across geographic coordinates
- Showing intensity or magnitude patterns in scientific measurements
- Displaying correlation strength or significance levels across data points

## Data

- `x` (numeric) - First variable plotted on the horizontal axis
- `y` (numeric) - Second variable plotted on the vertical axis
- `color` (numeric) - Third variable encoded as color intensity
- Size: 50-500 points recommended for clear visualization
- Example: Random data with a third variable representing intensity or magnitude

## Notes

- Use a perceptually uniform colormap (e.g., viridis) for accurate value interpretation
- Colorbar should have clear labels indicating the mapped variable and its units
- Points should have moderate size to ensure color visibility
- Consider transparency if points overlap significantly
