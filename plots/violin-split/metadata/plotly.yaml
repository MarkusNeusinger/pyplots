review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native split violin capability with side="negative"/"positive"
  - Clean, professional color scheme with Python-themed blue and yellow
  - Mean lines provide useful statistical reference within each distribution
  - 'Good data storytelling: training program effectiveness clearly visible across
    all departments'
  - Proper output of both PNG and interactive HTML formats
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (alpha 0.1 is quite faint)
  - Distribution shapes are all unimodal normal; could benefit from more variety to
    showcase violin plot capabilities
