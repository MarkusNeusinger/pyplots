review:
  strengths:
  - Gradient fill implementation using Highcharts linearGradient is well done, creating
    a visually appealing transition from opaque to transparent
  - Realistic data generation with growth trend + weekly cyclical pattern + noise
    creates a convincing website traffic dataset
  - Proper Selenium-based export pipeline following library best practices (inline
    JS, headless Chrome)
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas (72px title, 48px axis titles, 36px
    labels)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis minimum set to 1000 creates excessive wasted vertical space — data starts
    around 1900, so nearly 1/3 of the vertical axis shows empty area, compressing
    the actual data visualization
  - X-axis title Day of Month is not rendering or is cut off in the final PNG output,
    despite being configured in the code
  - The plot.html standalone file is generated unnecessarily (not required by spec)
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart titled "area-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" centered at the top in bold text. The chart shows daily website
    visitors (count) over 30 days. The line is drawn in a steel-blue color (#306998)
    with small circular markers at each data point. The area beneath the line is filled
    with a vertical linear gradient, transitioning from semi-transparent blue near
    the line to nearly transparent blue at the bottom. The Y-axis is labeled "Daily
    Visitors (count)" and ranges from 1,000 to 3,900. The X-axis shows day numbers
    1 through 30, but the "Day of Month" axis title is not visible in the rendered
    image (likely cut off or not rendered). The data shows an upward growth trend
    from ~2,400 to ~3,700 visitors with clear weekly oscillations. Gridlines are present
    and subtle. There is significant wasted vertical space between Y=1,000 and Y≈1,900
    where no data exists, reducing the effective visual resolution of the actual data
    range.
