review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent lift curve implementation with proper mathematical calculation of cumulative
    lift ratio
  - Clear reference line at y=1 with helpful annotation explaining random selection
    baseline
  - 'Well-chosen data: beta distributions create realistic score separation between
    positive/negative classes'
  - Decile markers (points at 10% intervals) aid interpretation per spec recommendation
  - 'Proper lets-plot idioms: ggsize for dimensions, scale=3 for 4800x2700 output,
    theme customization'
  weaknesses: []
