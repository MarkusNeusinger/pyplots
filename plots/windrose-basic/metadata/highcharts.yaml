review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent wind rose visualization with clear polar stacked bar representation
  - Color progression from cool to warm is intuitive and colorblind-safe
  - Data generation is realistic with prevailing westerly pattern and Weibull speed
    distribution
  - All 8 compass directions are clearly labeled with appropriate frequency percentages
  - Title format follows spec exactly
  weaknesses:
  - The Frequency (%) radial axis title overlaps with percentage labels - consider
    removing or repositioning
  - Uses manual JSON config instead of highcharts-core Python library (acceptable
    but less idiomatic)
