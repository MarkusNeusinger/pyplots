review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required features present including individual
    variance bars, cumulative line, threshold lines, and annotation at 95% crossing'
  - Strong data storytelling with the annotated threshold crossing point guiding viewers
    to the key PCA selection insight
  - Real-world Wine dataset provides authentic, meaningful data instead of synthetic
    random values
  - Clean visual design with white-filled markers, subtle bar overlay, and removed
    spines
  weaknesses:
  - 'Limited seaborn usage: only sns.lineplot is used as a plot function; bars, annotations,
    and styling are all pure matplotlib — consider using more seaborn features or
    styling'
  - The annotation text positioning could be improved to avoid proximity overlap with
    the line near components 7-9
  - Title format prepends Wine Dataset PCA before the required format; should follow
    spec-id · library · pyplots.ai more strictly
  - Red and orange threshold lines could be improved for colorblind accessibility
    — consider using more distinct colors or adding different line patterns
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance curve for
    PCA on the Wine dataset with 13 principal components. A dark blue line (#306998)
    with white-filled circle markers traces the cumulative variance from ~36% at component
    1 up to ~100% at component 13. Subtle light gray-blue bars show individual variance
    for each component, declining from ~36% (PC1) to near 0% (PC13). Two horizontal
    dashed threshold lines are drawn: red (#E74C3C) at 95% and orange (#F39C12) at
    90%, with bold percentage labels on the right edge. A large red filled marker
    highlights component 10 where cumulative variance first exceeds 95% (96.2%), with
    a bold red annotation and arrow pointing to it reading "10 components (96.2%)".
    The title reads "Wine Dataset PCA · line-pca-variance-cumulative · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    X-axis: "Number of Principal Components", Y-axis: "Explained Variance (%)". Top
    and right spines are removed. A legend in center-right displays "Cumulative Variance"
    and "Individual Variance".'
