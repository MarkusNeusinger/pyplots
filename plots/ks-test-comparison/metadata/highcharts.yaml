review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required K-S test features are present and clearly
    rendered (ECDFs, max divergence, K-S stat, p-value)
  - Strong design work with the callout annotation, plot band highlighting, and subtitle
    conveying the statistical conclusion
  - Good use of Highcharts-distinctive features (annotations API with callout shape
    and shadow, plotBands, step series)
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with additional dashed-line differentiation for the
    Bad Customers series
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate data generation using beta distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Layout balance could be improved — the x-axis starts at 100 but data begins around
    200, creating wasted left margin; asymmetric margins (180 left vs 60 right)
  - Max distance line color (#2c3e50) is too similar to Good Customers color (#306998),
    reducing visual distinction
  - LineSeries imported from options.series.area instead of options.series.line —
    works but is not idiomatic
  - Extra Path('plot.html').write_text() call creates an unnecessary file beyond the
    temp file already used
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparison for credit
    score distributions. Two ECDF step functions are shown: a solid blue line (#306998)
    for "Good Customers" and a dashed orange line (#e67e22) for "Bad Customers". The
    x-axis shows "Credit Score (200–1000)" ranging from 100 to 1000, and the y-axis
    shows "Cumulative Proportion (0–1)" from 0 to 1. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle reporting "K-S Statistic = 0.7300 |
    p-value = 9.54e-78 | Distributions are significantly different". A vertical dashed
    dark line with diamond markers at both endpoints marks the point of maximum divergence
    around credit score ~620. A callout annotation box with shadow reads "D = 0.7300
    / Strong separation". A subtle gray plot band highlights the region of maximum
    divergence. The background is light gray (#f5f6f8) with dashed horizontal grid
    lines. The legend is centered at the bottom with entries for all three series.
    The Bad Customers distribution rises earlier (lower scores) while Good Customers
    rises later (higher scores), showing clear separation.'
