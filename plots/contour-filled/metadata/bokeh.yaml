review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and visual appeal
  - Smart contour line styling with white base + dark outline for visibility across
    all elevation levels
  - Well-implemented terrain elevation scenario with realistic 0-2000m scale
  - Clean integration of contourpy for precise contour line generation
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt ticks)
  - HoverTool implementation provides interactivity in HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling still somewhat prominent (alpha 0.3 with width 2); could be reduced
    further for cleaner contour visualization
  - Colorbar title is slightly small relative to other text elements
  image_description: The plot shows a filled contour visualization of terrain elevation
    data using the Viridis colormap. The image displays a 2D surface with multiple
    Gaussian peaks representing elevation values from 0 to 2000 meters. There are
    three prominent bright yellow-green peaks (highest elevations around 1800-2000m)
    and one darker purple depression (lowest elevations). White contour lines with
    thin dark outlines are overlaid on the filled surface for precise level identification.
    The title "contour-filled · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner.
    The X-axis is labeled "Distance East (km)" and the Y-axis is labeled "Distance
    North (km)". A vertical colorbar on the right side shows "Terrain Elevation (m)"
    with tick marks from 0 to 2000. A subtle white dashed grid overlays the plot.
    The overall layout is well-balanced with the plot filling most of the canvas.

        comment: Uses bokeh's image, HoverTool for interactivity, and contourpy integration;
          however, hover functionality only works in HTML output, not visible in PNG.
          Interactive tools (pan, zoom) are appropriate for Bokeh's strengths.
  verdict: APPROVED
