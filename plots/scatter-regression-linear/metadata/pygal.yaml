quality_score: 90
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the confidence interval band using polygon fill technique
  - Clean, professional appearance with good color scheme (blue points, salmon CI
    band, green regression line)
  - R² value prominently displayed in the legend with the full regression equation
  - Appropriate data scenario (study hours vs exam scores) that effectively demonstrates
    linear regression
  - Good use of pygal's custom Style for font sizing at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Study Hours (hrs)" and "Exam Score (points)")
  - Regression line could be more visually prominent against the CI band
  - The regression equation could be placed as a separate annotation rather than in
    the legend for better visibility
