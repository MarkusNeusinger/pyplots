review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with title 24pt bold, axis titles 20pt, and tick labels
    16pt
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with show_half parameter for half-violin
  - Realistic reaction time experiment context with appropriate scale
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B demonstrates feature coverage well
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Interactive tooltips enhance the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical layout issue: jittered points overlap with boxplot and violin instead
    of being positioned clearly to the left/below, breaking the rain falling from
    cloud visual metaphor'
  - Redundant legend showing conditions that are already labeled on X-axis
  - Points need position_nudge or similar to offset them clearly from the cloud/boxplot
