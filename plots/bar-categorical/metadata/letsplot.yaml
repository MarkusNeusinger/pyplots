review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation following ggplot2 grammar of graphics
  - Automatic count computation using geom_bar() without stat=identity
  - Well-sized text elements (24pt title, 20pt axis labels, 16pt tick text) following
    library guidelines
  - Good use of theme_minimal() with appropriate grid customization
  - Proper figure sizing (1600x900 with scale=3 for 4800x2700 output)
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage lets-plot interactive features (tooltips, hover effects) that
    distinguish it from plotnine
  - Data context is generic; could use a more specific real-world scenario
