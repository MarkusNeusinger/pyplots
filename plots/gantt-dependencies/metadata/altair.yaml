review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of dependency arrows using rule marks with triangular
    endpoints
  - Good hierarchical organization with group headers and indented tasks
  - Color-coded phases with clear visual distinction
  - Proper use of Altair layering for complex chart composition
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional task information
  - Clean legend explaining all visual elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text DeploymentDependencies runs together without space separator
  - Some task labels on left side could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart showing a software development
    project with 5 phases: Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment.
    Each phase is shown as a bold group header with a dark aggregate bar spanning
    its duration, followed by indented individual tasks with colored bars. Tasks are
    color-coded by phase: Requirements (dark blue #306998), Design (yellow #FFD43B),
    Development (light blue #4B8BBE), Testing (gray #646464), and Deployment (light
    yellow #FFE873). Red dashed lines with triangle arrowheads connect task end points
    to successor task start points, clearly showing finish-to-start dependencies.
    The timeline runs from January 2024 to mid-May 2024 along the x-axis with dates
    formatted as "Jan 07", "Jan 14", etc. A color legend at the bottom identifies
    each phase and the dependency line style. The title "gantt-dependencies · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.'
