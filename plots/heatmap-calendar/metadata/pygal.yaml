review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style visual design with authentic green color palette
  - Well-implemented custom CalendarHeatmap class extending pygal Graph
  - Dynamic legend with numeric value ranges based on actual data
  - Comprehensive summary statistics (total contributions, active days, longest streak,
    average)
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Realistic GitHub contribution simulation with weekday patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Legend value ranges have overlapping boundaries (4-7 and 7-10 both include 7)
  - Code uses class/functions which violates KISS principle (though necessary for
    pygal custom chart)
