review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and distinct color-coded event markers
  - Smart use of staggered flag heights to avoid overlap
  - Clean dashed connector lines linking flags to price levels
  - Proper implementation of multiple event types (earnings, dividend, split, news)
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are not properly displayed (only shows 0 at origin)
  - Event flags are simple circles rather than flag-shaped markers as specified
  - Could leverage pygal interactive tooltips more effectively in the HTML output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price chart with event flag markers.
    The main price line is shown in blue, depicting ~180 trading days of stock data
    starting around $150 and fluctuating between ~$125-$165. Eight distinct event
    flags are positioned above the price line at different heights, connected to the
    price level via vertical dashed lines. The events are color-coded by type: teal
    circles for Earnings (3 events), green circles for Dividend (3 events), purple
    circle for Split (1 event), and red circle for News (1 event). The title "stock-event-flags
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Stock Price ($)"
    and X-axis shows "Trading Day Index (2024)". A legend at the bottom identifies
    each event type with colored dots: Stock Price, Earnings, Dividend, Split, and
    News. The layout is well-balanced with good use of the canvas space.'
