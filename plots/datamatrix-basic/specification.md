# datamatrix-basic: Basic Data Matrix 2D Barcode

## Description

A Data Matrix 2D barcode visualization that encodes data into a compact square or rectangular matrix of black and white cells. Data Matrix codes follow the ISO/IEC 16022 standard, featuring an L-shaped finder pattern (solid borders on two adjacent sides) and alternating timing patterns on the opposite sides. This barcode format is ideal for marking small items and supports high data density with built-in error correction (ECC 200).

## Applications

- Small item marking for electronics, medical devices, and aerospace components
- Document management and archival tracking systems
- Industrial parts identification and manufacturing traceability
- Postal services for mail sorting and tracking
- Pharmaceutical serialization for drug authentication and supply chain security

## Data

- `content` (string) - The text, alphanumeric, or binary data to encode in the Data Matrix
- `size` (string) - Matrix dimensions: auto-sized based on content, or specified (e.g., "10x10", "12x12")
- Size: Supports up to 2,335 alphanumeric characters or 3,116 numeric digits
- Example: "SERIAL:12345678" or "https://example.com/product/ABC123"

## Notes

- Include a quiet zone (white border) of at least 1 module width around the code for reliable scanning
- Use high contrast black on white for maximum readability
- L-shaped finder pattern (solid black on left and bottom edges) is mandatory for orientation
- Alternating (clock) pattern on top and right edges provides timing reference
- ECC 200 error correction is the modern standard (supports up to 30% data recovery)
- Recommended libraries: `pylibdmtx`, `treepoem`, or `segno` (which supports Data Matrix)
- Output should be scalable; vector format or high-resolution PNG (300+ DPI) recommended for printing
