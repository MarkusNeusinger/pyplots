review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step-area visualization that clearly shows cumulative distribution behavior
  - Proper use of gradient fill creates visually appealing depth effect
  - Clear title format following pyplots.ai convention with informative subtitle
  - Well-chosen realistic educational context with appropriate sample size
  - Good colorblind-safe color choice (#306998)
  - Proper use of Selenium for PNG export with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned more optimally (e.g., inside the plot area in lower-right
    corner)
  - Output image height slightly differs from specified 2700px
