review:
  strengths:
  - Clear community clustering with three distinct visual groups (Engineering blue,
    Marketing yellow, Sales coral)
  - Hub labels effectively highlight high-degree nodes without cluttering the visualization
  - Node sizes scale appropriately by connection count, making network structure immediately
    apparent
  - Proper force-directed layout algorithm implementation with visible inter-community
    bridge connections
  - Clean colorblind-accessible palette using distinct hues (blue, yellow, coral)
  weaknesses:
  - Some Hub labels overlap with nodes or other Hub labels in dense areas, reducing
    readability
  - The plot could utilize slightly more canvas area - there is unused whitespace
    on the left and right edges
