review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme using Python-branded colors with good accessibility
  - Clean implementation with proper date handling using matplotlib.dates
  - Logical task ordering by start date (reversed for top-to-bottom reading)
  - Today marker with dashed red line adds practical utility
  - Proper bar spacing and sizing for clear readability
  - Complete legend including all categories and the Today marker
  - Subtle x-axis grid without overwhelming the visualization
  - Good use of tight_layout and bbox_inches for clean output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Timeline, Tasks) - could be more descriptive like Project
    Timeline (2025) and Project Tasks
  - Could leverage more matplotlib features like annotations for key milestones
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal Gantt chart showing a software
    development project timeline. There are 12 tasks arranged vertically from top
    to bottom: Requirements Analysis, System Design, Database Setup, Backend Development,
    Frontend Development, API Integration, Unit Testing, Documentation, Integration
    Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Deployment Prep, and Go Live. Each task is represented
    by a horizontal bar spanning from its start date to end date. The bars are color-coded
    by category: dark blue (Python Blue #306998) for Planning tasks, yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Development tasks, light blue (#4B8BBE) for Testing tasks, and gray (#646464)
    for Deployment tasks. A vertical dashed red line marks "Today" (March 15). The
    x-axis shows dates from early January to early May 2025 with bi-weekly Monday
    intervals (e.g., Jan 13, Jan 27, Feb 10). The title reads "gantt-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" in bold. A legend in the upper right identifies the four categories
    plus the Today marker. The plot has subtle vertical grid lines and clean styling
    with top/right spines removed.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib.dates for date formatting/locating, Patch for custom
          legend, barh for horizontal bars. Could have used additional features like
          annotations for milestones or progress indicators.
