review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of 3D bars using polygon-based isometric projection in
    a 2D library
  - Effective use of viridis color scale to reinforce z-values for depth perception
  - Interactive tooltips provide hover information (Product, Quarter, Revenue)
  - Clean floor grid and axis indicators aid depth perception
  - Proper depth sorting ensures correct rendering order (back-to-front)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper function project_3d_to_2d() which violates KISS code structure requirement
    - inline the projection math instead
  - Product and quarter labels overlap with bar positions in the crowded center area
    - reposition labels further from bars
  - Some labels (Sports, Books) are difficult to read against the bars - adjust label
    placement or add background
  - Fixed perspective angle - consider documenting that interactive rotation is available
    via HTML export
