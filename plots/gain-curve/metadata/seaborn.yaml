review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing and colorblind-safe palette
  - Complete implementation of all spec requirements including model curve, baseline,
    and perfect model
  - Realistic customer churn scenario that aligns perfectly with spec applications
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducibility via fixed seed
  - Shaded lift area effectively highlights model improvement over baseline
  weaknesses:
  - Library features could be better utilized - mostly uses basic sns.lineplot which
    offers little advantage over pure matplotlib
  - Legend placement in lower right partially overlaps the data region; upper left
    would be cleaner
