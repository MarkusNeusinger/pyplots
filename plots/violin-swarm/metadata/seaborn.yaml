review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of violin and swarm plots with proper layering
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.4) allowing swarm points to be visible through
    violins
  - Contrasting darker colors for swarm points vs lighter violin fills
  - Bimodal distribution in Medium Dose demonstrates varied distribution shapes
  - Modern seaborn API usage with hue parameter for categorical coloring
  - Clean, readable KISS code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Could use seaborn set_theme() for more cohesive styling
  - Grid styling could be slightly more refined
  image_description: 'The plot displays a violin plot with overlaid swarm points showing
    reaction time distributions across four experimental conditions (Control, Low
    Dose, Medium Dose, High Dose). Each condition has a semi-transparent violin shape
    in distinct colors: blue for Control, yellow for Low Dose, light teal for Medium
    Dose, and tan/orange for High Dose. Swarm points are rendered in darker contrasting
    shades of the same color palette, clearly visible against the transparent violin
    fills. The Medium Dose condition shows a bimodal distribution with two density
    peaks, while others show unimodal distributions. The title "violin-swarm · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, with "Condition" on the x-axis and "Reaction
    Time (ms)" on the y-axis. A subtle horizontal grid with dashed lines aids readability.
    The layout is well-balanced with appropriate spacing.'
