review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization concept with ghosted previous state bars showing transition
  - Clear value labels with meaningful change indicators (arrows + percentages)
  - LIVE indicator adds to the real-time aesthetic
  - Realistic server metrics scenario is compelling
  - Good use of color for positive/negative changes
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: No seaborn library usage - This is pure matplotlib code, fails AR-05
    (Library not used) criteria. Must use sns.barplot() or other seaborn functions.'
  - The motion blur horizontal lines are barely visible and do not effectively convey
    animation
  - Legend position could conflict with taller bars in other datasets
  - Green/red color scheme for changes is not colorblind-accessible
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time updating bar chart showing server
    metrics (requests per second) for 6 services: API Gateway (847), Auth Service
    (623), Database (512), Cache (389), Worker Queue (278), and CDN (156). Each bar
    has a "ghosted" lighter version behind it showing the previous state, creating
    a visual transition effect. Above each bar are value labels in bold dark blue
    text, and change indicators with colored arrows (green ▲ for increases like +6.9%,
    +2.8%, +13.7%; red ▼ for decreases like -5.3%, -5.8%, -17.5%). The title "bar-realtime
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is at the top. A "● LIVE" indicator in red appears in
    the upper left with "Last update: 0.8s ago" text. A legend in the upper right
    shows "Previous State" and "Current State". The Y-axis is labeled "Requests per
    Second" and X-axis is "Service". Horizontal dashed grid lines at alpha 0.3 provide
    reference. The color scheme uses blue (#306998) with varying alpha levels.'

          Should use sns.barplot() or other seaborn functions.'
