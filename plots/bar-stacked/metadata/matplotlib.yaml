review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with distinct, harmonious colors
  - Total value labels above each bar as recommended in spec
  - Clean visual styling with white edge borders separating stacked segments
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible quarterly revenue data
  - Proper use of tight_layout and bbox_inches for clean output
  weaknesses:
  - Data is hardcoded without np.random.seed() - while deterministic, adding a seed
    comment would clarify reproducibility intent
  - Legend placement inside plot area could overlap with taller bars in other datasets
