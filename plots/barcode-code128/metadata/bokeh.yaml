review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Code 128 encoding with complete encoding tables
  - Proper calculation of checksum using modulo 103 algorithm
  - Clean barcode rendering using Bokeh quad glyph method
  - Appropriate quiet zones for scanner compatibility
  - Human-readable text properly positioned below barcode
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  - High contrast black/white design for maximum scan reliability
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could use more of the vertical canvas space (barcode is relatively small
    in the large canvas)
  - Could demonstrate the full range of Code 128 character encoding capability
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode on a white background. The
    title "barcode-code128 · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in dark
    gray text (32pt font). The barcode itself consists of alternating black and white
    vertical bars of varying widths, correctly encoding the text "SHIP-2024-ABC123".
    The barcode is horizontally centered with adequate quiet zones (white space) on
    both left and right sides for scanner compatibility. Below the barcode, the human-readable
    text "SHIP-2024-ABC123" is displayed in a monospace font (28pt), centered under
    the bars. The overall layout is clean with high contrast between the black bars
    and white background. The canvas size is 4800x2700 pixels with the barcode occupying
    roughly the middle third of the vertical space.
