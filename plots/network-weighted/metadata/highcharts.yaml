review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 12 distinct node colors
  - Node sizing by weighted degree effectively shows collaboration hubs
  - Good use of Highcharts networkgraph module with force-directed layout
  - Clean subtitle explains the weight encoding
  - Proper white text outlines ensure label legibility
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining the edge weight scale (spec recommends a legend or annotation
    explaining the weight scale)
  - Network graph is offset to the right with ~60% empty whitespace on the left side
    of canvas
  - Uses raw JavaScript/HTML generation instead of highcharts-core Python API
  image_description: The plot displays a weighted network graph representing university
    department collaborations. There are 12 circular nodes of varying sizes (CS, MATH,
    PHYS, STAT, EE, ME, BIO, CHEM, ECON, PSYCH, MED, ENV) connected by edges of varying
    thickness. Node sizes reflect weighted degree (total collaboration strength),
    with CS and BIO being among the largest. Edge colors are a consistent dark blue
    (#306998), with thickness clearly varying to show collaboration intensity (thickest
    edges include BIO-MED and CS-EE). Each node has a distinct color from a colorblind-safe
    palette (blue, yellow, purple, cyan, brown, pink, gray, olive, orange, green,
    red). Labels appear both inside larger nodes and outside smaller ones with white
    text outlines for legibility. The title "network-weighted · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top with a descriptive subtitle explaining that edge thickness
    represents joint publications. The network is positioned center-right on the canvas
    with notable whitespace on the left side.
