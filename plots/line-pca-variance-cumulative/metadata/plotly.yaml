review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data choice: real Wine dataset provides authentic PCA results with
    a natural elbow curve'
  - 'Strong spec compliance: includes all key features (cumulative line, individual
    bars, threshold lines, markers)'
  - Perfect text legibility with all font sizes explicitly set well above minimum
    thresholds
  - Good use of Plotly-specific features (hovertemplate, add_hline with annotations,
    HTML export)
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Individual variance bars at alpha 0.25 are quite faint and could benefit from
    slightly higher opacity for better visibility
  - No elbow point annotation — adding a marker or annotation at the elbow (around
    PC3-4) would strengthen the data storytelling narrative
  - Threshold annotations could be enhanced with vertical drop lines showing which
    component first crosses each threshold
  - Design could be more visually distinctive — consider adding a filled area under
    the cumulative curve or gradient effects to elevate beyond a well-configured default
  image_description: 'The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA component selection using the Wine dataset (13 components). A dark blue
    line with circular markers (size 16, width 5) traces the cumulative variance from
    ~36% at PC1 rising steeply through the first few components and flattening toward
    ~100% at PC13. Light blue-gray semi-transparent bars (alpha 0.25) underneath show
    individual variance ratios, forming a classic scree pattern with a tall first
    bar (~36%) declining rapidly. Two horizontal dashed threshold lines are shown:
    an orange line at 90% and a red line at 95%, both with percentage labels positioned
    on the right edge. The plotly_white template provides a clean white background
    with subtle horizontal gridlines. The title "line-pca-variance-cumulative · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at top. A legend in the upper-left distinguishes "Individual"
    (bar) and "Cumulative" (line) series.'
