review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features with detailed hovertemplate showing
    all three variables
  - Well-implemented log scaling for population sizes ensuring visual balance
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue as primary color
  - Proper 4800x2700 output using scale=3 approach
  - White marker borders help distinguish overlapping bubbles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - The size legend is only a text annotation rather than a visual bubble legend showing
    actual size-to-population mapping
  - Dense clustering in the upper-right region could benefit from slightly more transparency
    or smaller base sizes
