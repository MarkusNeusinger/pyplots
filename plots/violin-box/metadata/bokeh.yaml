review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of violin plot using KDE calculation and patch
    rendering
  - Clean color scheme with Python Blue violins and golden yellow boxes provides excellent
    visual distinction
  - Proper legend with all four components clearly identified
  - Good data variety showing different distribution shapes (normal, bimodal, with
    outliers)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is placed outside the plot area creating slight visual separation from
    the main plot
  - Outlier markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Grid/legend positioning could be improved by placing legend inside the plot area
  image_description: The plot displays four violin plots for study methods A, B, C,
    and D on a white background. Each violin is rendered in a blue color (#306998,
    Python blue) with KDE-based distribution shapes clearly visible. Inside each violin
    is a yellow/golden box plot (#FFD43B) showing the IQR (Q1-Q3), with a black median
    line. Whiskers extend from the boxes to the whisker limits, with small caps. White
    circular outliers with black borders are displayed for Methods A, B, C, and D.
    The title "violin-box · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The x-axis
    is labeled "Study Method" and the y-axis is labeled "Test Score" ranging from
    0 to 120. A legend on the right side shows "Distribution (KDE)", "IQR (Q1-Q3)",
    "Median", and "Outliers". Method D shows a bimodal distribution with a lower secondary
    peak. The grid is subtle (dashed, low alpha) on the y-axis only.

        comment: Legend is placed to the right outside plot area which is acceptable,
          but the y-axis grid extends above 100 (to 120) while data is all below 110

        comment: Custom KDE implementation rather than using Bokeh's built-in capabilities;
          does not leverage ColumnDataSource as effectively as possible for the violin
          shapes
  verdict: APPROVED
