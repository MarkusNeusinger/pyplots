review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for the large canvas (48pt title, 36pt axis labels, 28pt
    tick labels)
  - Clean three-cluster visualization with distinct, colorblind-safe colors
  - Good use of Bokeh interactive tools (hover tooltips with formatted values)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Realistic business context (marketing spend vs engagement)
  - Saves both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be better integrated with the plot (currently appears slightly
    isolated in top-right)
  - Could demonstrate alpha transparency more effectively by having some overlapping
    points between categories
  - Library features usage is good but not exceptional (could use linked selections
    or custom hover styling)
