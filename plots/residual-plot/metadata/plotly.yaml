review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all key residual plot features: zero reference line,
    ±2 SD bands, outlier highlighting, and smoothing trend line'
  - Good color scheme with distinct visual encoding for normal residuals (blue circles),
    outliers (yellow diamonds), and trend (red line)
  - Interactive hover templates provide useful diagnostic information (fitted value
    and residual)
  - Data generation creates interesting non-linear pattern that demonstrates the diagnostic
    purpose of residual plots
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows +2 SD and -2 SD as separate entries; could be combined into single
    ±2 SD Bounds entry
  - Axis labels lack units (though residuals are unitless, y-axis label is verbose)
  - Moving average smoothing could benefit from using a more sophisticated LOWESS
    approach for smoother trend detection
