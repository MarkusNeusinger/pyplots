review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizes and colorblind-safe viridis palette
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario (temperature across geographic grid) that demonstrates
    the color-mapping concept effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Colorbar is well-positioned with clear label including units
  - Good use of alpha=0.8 for transparency to handle overlapping points
  weaknesses:
  - Size encoding duplicates the color encoding (both map to temperature) without
    adding informational value
  - Grid legend comment says disabled legend but size variation without legend may
    confuse viewers
  - Could leverage seaborn native hue legend capabilities instead of manually creating
    ScalarMappable
  image_description: The plot displays a color-mapped scatter plot showing 150 data
    points representing temperature readings across a geographic grid. The X-axis
    shows "Longitude (°E)" ranging from -10 to 10, and the Y-axis shows "Latitude
    (°N)" ranging from -8 to 8. Each point is colored using the viridis colormap,
    with a colorbar on the right indicating "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately
    12°C (dark purple) to 37°C (bright yellow). Points near the center of the plot
    are warmer (yellow/green) while those at the edges are cooler (blue/purple), clearly
    demonstrating the radial temperature pattern. The title reads "scatter-color-mapped
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot which is standard, but manually creates colorbar
          rather than leveraging seaborn's built-in hue handling with legend. The
          size parameter adds complexity but seaborn could handle color mapping more
          elegantly.
  verdict: APPROVED
