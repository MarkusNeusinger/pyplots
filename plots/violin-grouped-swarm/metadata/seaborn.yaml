review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of grouped violin with swarm overlay using proper seaborn
    API
  - Perfect color contrast with colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette
  - Violins have appropriate transparency (alpha=0.5) allowing swarm points to be
    visible
  - Swarm points properly dodged to align with their respective violins
  - Realistic data scenario with meaningful differences between groups
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Swarm points could be slightly smaller (size 3-4) to reduce overlap within dense
    regions
  image_description: The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm overlay showing
    response times (ms) across three task types (Simple Task, Moderate Task, Complex
    Task) and two expertise levels (Novice and Expert). The violins are rendered with
    semi-transparent fills - blue (#306998) for Novice and golden-yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Expert. Each violin shape reveals the distribution density, with swarm points
    overlaid showing individual data points. The violins are properly grouped side-by-side
    within each task category. The title uses the correct format "violin-grouped-swarm
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend in the upper left identifies the
    two expertise levels. The y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately
    50-1100ms, and the x-axis shows "Task Type" with three categories. A subtle dashed
    grid is visible on the y-axis. The data clearly shows novices have longer and
    more variable response times, especially as task complexity increases.
