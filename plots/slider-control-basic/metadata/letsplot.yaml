review:
  strengths:
  - Well-structured, readable code following KISS principles
  - Excellent color palette choice (Tableau colorblind-safe)
  - Good text sizing and legibility throughout
  - Realistic temperature data with seasonal patterns
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Rich tooltips providing detailed hover information
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Missing actual slider widget - the spec explicitly requires a slider
    control for parameter adjustment, not legend-based filtering. Lets-plot supports
    interactive widgets that could implement this'
  - Legend text click to filter is misleading in the static PNG output since clicking
    does nothing
  - Does not demonstrate lets-plot distinctive interactive capabilities (ggtb, bunch,
    or widget features)
  - The slider-like filtering claim in comments does not match what the spec requires
    - a slider allows continuous/discrete stepping through values, legend clicking
    is binary visibility toggle
