review:
  strengths:
  - Clear station node representation with white fill and blue stroke
  - Effective use of directional arrows showing travel direction
  - Good color differentiation between route types (Express, Regional, Airport, Local)
  - Well-structured code with proper offset handling for overlapping routes
  - Realistic transport network data with meaningful station names
  - Appropriate use of theme_void() for network diagram
  weaknesses:
  - Edge labels (route IDs and times) are too small (size=9) and many are not visible
    or readable
  - Some edge labels overlap with edges and each other, particularly in congested
    areas
  - Legend labels use descriptive text instead of route codes which differs slightly
    from raw data representation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static transport network diagram with 12
    stations (Central, North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast,
    Southwest, Airport, University, Industrial) represented as blue-outlined circular
    nodes with white fill. Station names appear above each node in bold dark gray
    text. Directed routes connect stations using colored arrows: Express routes (RE)
    in blue, Regional routes (RB) in yellow/gold, Airport routes (AE) in red, and
    Local routes (S) in green. The arrows show travel direction with arrowheads. A
    legend on the right side identifies the four route types. Edge labels showing
    route IDs and times (e.g., "RE1 | 06:00→06:35") are present but many are difficult
    to read - only a few are visible at the center of the plot and they are quite
    small. The title "network-transport-static · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in bold. The overall layout uses a radial-like arrangement with Central
    station in the middle.'
