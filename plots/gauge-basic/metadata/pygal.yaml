review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal SolidGauge with half_pie=True for semi-circular display
  - Clean color zone logic that changes gauge color based on value thresholds
  - Professional custom styling with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Good use of value_formatter for percentage display
  - Realistic sales performance context that matches spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - The threshold zones (red/yellow/green) are not visually displayed on the gauge
    - only the current zone color shows
  - Title format includes extra text (Sales Performance) before the required format
  - Legend is positioned far from the gauge in the bottom-left corner
