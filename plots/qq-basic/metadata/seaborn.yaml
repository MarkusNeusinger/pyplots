review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with proper font sizes and colorblind-safe palette
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Proper axis labels as specified (Theoretical Quantiles and Sample Quantiles)
  - Reference line (y=x) is clearly visible and properly labeled in legend
  - Data demonstrates right-skewed distribution deviation from normality
  - Good marker sizing (s=200) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Manual implementation of inverse normal CDF adds unnecessary complexity when scipy.stats.norm.ppf
    could be used (though acceptable for dependency-free code)
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features beyond basic scatterplot
  - Data example shows only right skewness but not other Q-Q characteristics like
    heavy tails or S-curves mentioned in specification
