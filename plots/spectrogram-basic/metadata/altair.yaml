review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent STFT implementation from scratch using numpy FFT, demonstrating understanding
    of signal processing
  - Proper use of x/x2/y/y2 encoding for precise rectangle positioning without gaps
  - Good use of viridis colormap as recommended in the specification for perceptually
    uniform display
  - Clean dB scale conversion with appropriate epsilon to avoid log(0)
  - Interactive tooltips showing Time, Frequency, and Power values
  - Correctly limits frequency range to 0-1000 Hz for better visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Missing .interactive() call which would enable zoom/pan for detailed exploration
    of the spectrogram
  - Colorbar font sizes could be slightly larger for better visibility
