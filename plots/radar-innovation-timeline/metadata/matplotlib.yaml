review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling through marker size hierarchy — near-term Adopt technologies
    are visually prominent while speculative Hold items recede
  - Colorblind-safe Okabe-Ito palette with redundant marker shape encoding provides
    strong accessibility
  - Pastel ring fills with subtle alpha create clear time-horizon separation without
    visual noise
  - Real, current technology names with plausible ring placements make the chart immediately
    meaningful
  - Smart label placement with alternating offsets and white bbox backgrounds maintains
    readability at high density
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation item labels at 13pt are below recommended 16pt threshold — increasing
    to 14-15pt would improve readability at smaller display sizes
  - Labels in the Security/Hold area (Post-Quantum Crypto and Homomorphic Encryption)
    are densely packed and nearly touching
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree polar radar chart titled "radar-innovation-timeline
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Four concentric rings represent time horizons labeled
    Adopt (innermost, pastel blue fill), Trial (pastel green), Assess (pastel yellow),
    and Hold (outermost, pastel pink). Ring labels appear in bold italic in the upper-right
    gap. Four angular sectors divide the arc equally: AI & ML (upper-left), Cloud
    & Infra (lower-left), Data Engineering (bottom), and Security (right), each labeled
    in bold 20pt text along the outer edge. 22 technology items are plotted as labeled
    markers — blue circles for AI & ML, orange squares for Cloud & Infra, green diamonds
    for Data Engineering, and pink triangles for Security. Marker sizes decrease from
    inner to outer rings, creating visual hierarchy emphasizing near-term technologies.
    Each label has a white rounded background box for readability. A legend in the
    lower-right maps sector colors and marker shapes. The chart fills the square canvas
    well, with the arc gap used efficiently for ring labels.'

        comment: Marker sizes intentionally varied by ring (280-130) creating clear
