review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual hierarchy with excellent text sizing at all levels (title, axis labels,
    ticks)
  - 'Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics: layered geoms, annotations, and
    theme customization'
  - The yellow dashed vertical line with annotation clearly highlights the optimal
    k value
  - Clean, professional appearance using theme_minimal with subtle grid
  - Good color contrast between the blue data line and yellow annotation
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis shows decimal values (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0) instead of integers (1, 2, 3,
    ..., 10) which would be more appropriate for discrete k values
  - The realistic context is somewhat generic - could use a more specific domain scenario

  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering on a
    clean white background. A blue line (#306998) connects 10 data points from k=1
    to k=10, with circular markers at each discrete k value. The curve starts at approximately
    1000 inertia for k=1 and decreases sharply until k=4, then flattens out to around
    60-70 for k=10. A yellow/gold dashed vertical line marks the optimal k=4 position,
    with a yellow "Optimal k = 4" annotation placed to the right of this line. The
    title "elbow-curve · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.
    The x-axis is labeled "Number of Clusters (k)" and the y-axis is labeled "Inertia
    (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)". A subtle gray grid is visible in the background.
