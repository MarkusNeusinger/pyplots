review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of event annotation pattern using plotLines with alternating
    label positions
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with blue line and yellow event markers
  - Proper use of Highcharts datetime axis with appropriate label formatting
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with proper Selenium screenshot
    workflow
  - Realistic business scenario with 5 distinct milestones across 180-day period
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Could leverage Highcharts native annotation module for more sophisticated event
    labels
  - Event marker scatter points could have tooltips showing event details for better
    interactivity in HTML output
  image_description: 'The plot shows a time series line chart spanning January 2024
    to late June 2024. A blue line (#306998) displays "Daily Active Users" data ranging
    from approximately 10,000 to 16,200 users, showing an overall upward trend with
    visible seasonality and noise. Five vertical dashed yellow lines (#FFD43B) mark
    key events: "Feature A Launch" (mid-January), "Marketing Campaign" (late February),
    "App Redesign" (late March), "Partnership Deal" (late April), and "Mobile Update"
    (late May). Each event is labeled at the top of the chart with alternating vertical
    positions to avoid overlap. Yellow circular markers with black outlines appear
    on the line at each event date. The title reads "line-annotated-events · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Daily Active Users with Key Milestones". The x-axis
    shows monthly dates, y-axis shows "Daily Active Users", and a legend at the bottom
    identifies the two series.'

        comment: Title, labels, and axis text are all clearly readable at large font
          sizes. Event labels are slightly smaller relative to plot size but still
          legible.

        comment: Line width is appropriate, event markers are clearly visible with
          good contrast. Line could be slightly thicker for optimal visibility.

        comment: Uses plotLines for event markers, scatter series for event points,
          datetime axis. Could better leverage Highcharts' native annotation features
          or tooltips.
