review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of small multiples to represent animation in a static format, which
    is the correct approach per spec for libraries without animation support
  - Consistent color assignment across all panels enables easy entity tracking
  - Clean data generation with realistic growth patterns and volatility
  - Good seaborn API usage with hue parameter for coloring and palette for color consistency
  - Value labels clearly displayed outside bars for easy reading
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" not "description ·
    spec-id · library · pyplots.ai"
  - Legend isolated in separate panel instead of positioned near the plot data
  - Snapshot years array has duplicate 2023 which is used to fill the 6th panel as
    legend space - works but inelegant
  - Could use sns.set_context("talk") for better text scaling at high resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2×3 small multiples grid showing tech company
    market values over time (2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2023). Each panel shows horizontal
    bars sorted by value in ascending order (lowest at top, highest at bottom). The
    bars use the tab10 color palette with consistent colors per company across all
    panels. Values are displayed at the end of each bar in "$XXB" format (e.g., "$409B").
    The x-axis shows "Market Value (Billion $)" and ranges from 0-400+ depending on
    the panel. Company names appear on the y-axis. The 6th panel contains a legend
    showing all 10 companies in a 2-column layout. The overall title follows the required
    format: "Tech Company Market Values · bar-race-animated · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
    The visualization effectively shows ranking changes over time - for example, CloudNet
    rises from middle position in 2016 to top position by 2023.'
