review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Kagi algorithm with proper yang/yin state transitions
  - Clear visual distinction between bullish (thick green) and bearish (thin red)
    segments
  - Proper use of Altair mark_rule with x/x2/y/y2 encoding for line segments
  - Good code organization following the Kagi chart logic faithfully
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to help readers track price levels across the chart
  - Does not leverage Altair interactivity features (tooltips, hover effects) which
    would be valuable for financial data exploration
  - Legend shows line style but thickness difference is subtle in legend representation
  image_description: The plot displays a Kagi chart showing stock price movements
    over approximately 20 line indices. The chart uses green thick lines for Yang
    (Bullish) segments and red thin lines for Yin (Bearish) segments. The Y-axis shows
    "Price ($)" ranging from approximately 76 to 114, while the X-axis displays "Line
    Index" from 0 to 20. The title correctly shows "kagi-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    at the top center. A legend in the upper right corner distinguishes Yang (Bullish)
    in green from Yin (Bearish) in red. The chart shows clear trend reversals with
    horizontal shoulder/waist connectors between vertical segments, demonstrating
    multiple bullish and bearish phases including a significant downtrend in the early
    portion and recovery with new highs toward the right side.
