review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent normalization implementation with original value ranges preserved in
    axis labels
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.5) to handle 150 overlapping lines
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good visual distinction between species
  - Proper title format and comprehensive legend with species title
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use ColumnDataSource which is the recommended Bokeh pattern for data
    handling
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive exploration of individual data points
  - Legend font size could be larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Could benefit from vertical axis lines to better delineate dimensions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization with
    4 vertical axes representing Iris flower measurements: Sepal Length (4.3-7.9 cm),
    Sepal Width (2.0-4.3 cm), Petal Length (1.1-6.6 cm), and Petal Width (0.1-2.5
    cm). Each observation is drawn as a line connecting normalized values (0-1) across
    all axes. Three species are distinguished by color: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor
    (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica (green #4CAF50). The visualization clearly shows
    clustering patterns - Setosa lines cluster at low values for petal dimensions
    while remaining moderate for sepal dimensions. Virginica shows consistently high
    values across petal measurements. The legend is positioned in the top right corner
    with "Species" as the title. The title "parallel-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    in the top left.'

        comment: Uses basic Bokeh plotting functions (figure, line) but doesn't leverage
          Bokeh's interactive capabilities or HoverTool which would enhance a parallel
          coordinates visualization
  verdict: APPROVED
