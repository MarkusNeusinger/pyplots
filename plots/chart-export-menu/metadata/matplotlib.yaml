review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of interactive export buttons using matplotlib.widgets.Button
  - Clean visual design with good color contrast and readable text
  - Properly implements all four export formats (PNG, SVG, PDF, CSV) as specified
  - Good use of the correct title format and overall professional appearance
  - Realistic sales data scenario with uptrending Product A showing growth pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Export buttons positioned at bottom rather than top-right corner or hamburger
    menu style as suggested in spec
  - Axis label Units Sold could include units (e.g., Units Sold (count))
  - Functions are required for button callbacks but deviate from pure KISS structure
  image_description: 'The plot displays a dual-line chart showing monthly sales data
    for two products (Product A and Product B) over a 12-month period. Product A is
    shown in blue (#306998) with circular markers, while Product B is shown in yellow
    (#FFD43B) with square markers. Both lines have a linewidth of 3 and markers of
    appropriate size (12pt and 10pt respectively). The chart has a clear title "chart-export-menu
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis shows months (Jan-Dec) and y-axis
    shows "Units Sold" ranging from 0 to ~365. A legend in the upper left identifies
    the two series. A subtle dashed grid with alpha=0.3 aids readability. At the bottom
    of the figure, there is an "Export Menu:" label followed by four interactive buttons:
    "Export PNG", "Export SVG", "Export PDF", and "Export Data (CSV)" - all styled
    with blue backgrounds (#306998) and white text. The layout is well-balanced with
    the chart filling most of the canvas and the export menu clearly positioned at
    the bottom.'
