review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue, orange, green)
  - Good data generation showing realistic employee performance distributions with
    meaningful differences across departments and experience levels
  - Proper use of Tukey box mode showing outliers correctly
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Title format correctly follows spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are missing - the code sets x_labels but they do not appear
    in the rendered output
  - Legend shows all 9 series combinations instead of just 3 subcategories (Junior,
    Senior, Lead) as the spec requests
  - Legend font size appears small relative to the 4800x2700 canvas despite configured
    legend_font_size=40
