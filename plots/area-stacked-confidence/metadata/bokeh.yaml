review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stacked areas with confidence bands using Bokeh Band
    and varea
  - Clear visual hierarchy with solid areas, semi-transparent bands, and center lines
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Realistic energy consumption scenario with meaningful data patterns
  - Interactive legend allowing series hiding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned inside plot area overlaps with data in top-left corner
  - No hover tooltips to show exact values (missed opportunity for Bokeh interactivity)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing quarterly energy
    consumption by source (Solar, Wind, Hydro) from 2020 to 2026. Each energy source
    is represented with distinct colors: blue (#306998) for Solar at the bottom, yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Wind in the middle, and green (#4DAF4A) for Hydro at the top. Each
    stacked area is surrounded by semi-transparent confidence bands showing uncertainty
    ranges. The chart uses a datetime x-axis labeled "Quarter" and a numeric y-axis
    labeled "Energy Consumption (GWh)" ranging from 0 to approximately 270. The legend
    is positioned in the top-left corner with entries indicating "(± uncertainty)"
    for each source. The title correctly follows the format "area-stacked-confidence
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle and dashed. Solar shows a growing
    trend with increasing uncertainty, Wind displays seasonal variation, and Hydro
    remains relatively stable.'
