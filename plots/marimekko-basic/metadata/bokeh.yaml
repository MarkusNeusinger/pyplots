review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Marimekko chart concept with proportional bar
    widths
  - Clean visual hierarchy with white segment borders providing clear separation
  - Smart conditional labeling only on segments large enough to display values
  - Professional color palette with Python blue as primary color
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs with interactive hover tooltips in HTML version
  - Region labels include total market size for context
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position overlaps slightly with the rightmost portion of the chart area
  - No y-axis scale to indicate percentage proportions (0-100%)
  - Hover tool is only useful in HTML output, not visible in PNG
