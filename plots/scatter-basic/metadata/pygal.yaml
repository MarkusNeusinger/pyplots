  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - 'Strong data storytelling: trend line with r-value (0.86), sample size in legend,
    and deliberate outliers add narrative depth'
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with no over-engineering
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) with appropriate data
    scale
  - 'Good use of pygal-specific features: stroke_style dasharray, dual PNG/HTML output,
    value formatters'
  weaknesses:
  - The x-axis range starts at 0 while data begins at ~2, wasting canvas space on
    the left side
  - Grid lines could be more subtle — the blue dotted grid is functional but slightly
    dominant against the light background
  - The trend line is quite faint/thin relative to the scatter dots — increasing stroke
    width or using a more contrasting style would improve visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart titled "scatter-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" on a 4800x2700 canvas with a white background and light gray (#fafafa)
    plot area. Blue dots (#306998) represent 120 student data points plotting "Study
    Hours per Week (hrs)" (x-axis, 0-16) against "Exam Score (%)" (y-axis, 10%-100%).
    A dashed salmon/red (#c44e52) trend line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right,
    showing a strong positive correlation. The legend at the bottom displays two entries:
    "Students (n=120)" in blue and "Trend (r = 0.86)" in salmon. Light blue dotted
    grid lines are visible on both axes. Data points spread from ~2-14 hours and ~20%-95%
    scores, with deliberate outliers visible (e.g., ~7 hrs at 95%, ~12.5 hrs at 42%).
    The overall layout is clean and professional with generous margins.'

        comment: dots_size=10 with opacity=0.6 is appropriate for 120 points. Slightly
