review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of growing uncertainty band that widens over time
  - Good color contrast between blue band and yellow center line (colorblind-safe)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (s)" or "Value (units)")
  - Could use Bokeh native varea() glyph instead of patch() for cleaner band implementation
  - Legend text appears slightly small relative to the canvas size
