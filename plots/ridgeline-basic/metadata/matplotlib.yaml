review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with viridis colormap providing both aesthetic appeal
    and colorblind accessibility
  - Perfect implementation of the ridgeline concept with appropriate 60% overlap as
    specified
  - Realistic Northern Hemisphere temperature data showing clear seasonal patterns
    with appropriate variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good comments
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Manual KDE implementation using list comprehension is less efficient than using
    scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (alpha=0.2 instead of 0.3)
