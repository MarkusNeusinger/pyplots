quality_score: 94
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent shaded zones implementation using fill="tonexty" pattern
  - Proper use of add_hline and add_annotation for reference lines and labels
  - Clean RSI calculation using pandas rolling windows
  - Horizontal legend placement above plot maximizes chart area
  - Interactive HTML output alongside PNG
  - Data shows full range of RSI behavior (overbought, oversold, neutral)
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid/legend scoring: legend position is good but styling could be slightly more
    refined'
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart spanning January to May 2024. A blue line (labeled "RSI (14)")
    shows the oscillating RSI values ranging from approximately 10 to 90. The overbought
    zone (70-100) is shaded in light red/salmon color, while the oversold zone (0-30)
    is shaded in light green. Three horizontal reference lines are clearly visible:
    a red dashed line at 70 (overbought), a gray dotted line at 50 (neutral), and
    a green dashed line at 30 (oversold). Right-side annotations label each threshold.
    The Y-axis is fixed from 0 to 100 with tick marks every 10 units, labeled "RSI
    Value". The X-axis shows dates labeled "Date". The title "indicator-rsi · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A horizontal legend above the plot identifies
    all three visual elements. The data shows multiple overbought and oversold excursions,
    demonstrating the full range of RSI behavior.'
