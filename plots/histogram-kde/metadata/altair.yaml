review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data choice that clearly demonstrates the value of KDE smoothing
    over raw histograms
  - Perfect color contrast between blue histogram bars and yellow KDE line
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition (histogram + kde_line)
  - Correct density scaling allows histogram and KDE to be directly comparable
  - Well-configured font sizes following library guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis extends to 0-12 range where no data exists, creating unnecessary whitespace
    on the left
  - No subtle background grid to help read density values
  - Missing axis units (could be Test Score points and Density probability)
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram with KDE overlay showing a bimodal
    distribution of test scores. The histogram bars are rendered in semi-transparent
    blue (#306998 with opacity 0.5), ranging from approximately 20 to 100 on the x-axis
    labeled "Test Score". The y-axis shows "Density" values from 0.000 to 0.034. A
    smooth yellow/gold KDE curve (#FFD43B) overlays the histogram, clearly showing
    two peaks - a larger peak around 45 and a smaller peak around 72, demonstrating
    the bimodal nature of the data. The title "histogram-kde · altair · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top center. The plot has good proportions with clean axis
    labels and tick marks that are clearly readable.
