quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear color progression from dark to light across
    levels
  - Proper use of white borders to separate segments making hierarchy relationships
    clear
  - Labels are well-positioned and readable with appropriate styling (bold white for
    inner, dark for outer)
  - Realistic organizational budget scenario that demonstrates the sunburst concept
    effectively
  - Clean implementation that produces a professional-looking chart
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper function (create_wedge) which violates the KISS principle of no functions/classes
  - Could benefit from a simple legend explaining the color-branch relationship
  - Some segments (like SMB, Retail) appear relatively small; could show more variation
    in data
