  strengths:
  - 'Perfect raincloud metaphor: cloud above, box on baseline, rain below — exactly
    as specified'
  - Excellent data diversity showing normal, shifted, bimodal, and high-variance distributions
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B clearly visible in the KDE, demonstrating
    the plot type's value
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between all four conditions
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper seed and linear flow
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title Reaction Time (ms) is not visible in the rendered image — likely
    cut off despite margin settings; needs further margin/spacing adjustment
  - Box plots render with white fills instead of group-colored fills, breaking the
    visual color connection between the three components of each category
  - No annotations or storytelling — the bimodal distribution in Treatment B and the
    faster responses in Treatment A deserve callouts
  - KDE clouds could have slightly more visual polish (e.g., subtle edge color differentiation
    from fill)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with 4 categories
    (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C) on the y-axis and reaction time
    values (250–650 ms) on the x-axis. Each category features three layered components:
    a half-violin KDE (cloud) extending above the category baseline, a box plot centered
    on the baseline, and jittered scatter points (rain) below the baseline. Colors
    are blue (Control), yellow (Treatment A), purple (Treatment B), and cyan (Treatment
    C). The title reads "raincloud-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top. A
    legend in the upper right lists the four conditions. The bimodal distribution
    of Treatment B is clearly visible in its KDE. Box plots appear with white fills
    and black outlines. Dotted grid lines run horizontally. The x-axis title "Reaction
    Time (ms)" appears to be cut off or missing at the bottom of the chart.'
