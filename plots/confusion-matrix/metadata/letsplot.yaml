review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast using scale_color_identity() for dynamic white/black text
    based on cell darkness
  - Row-normalized percentages with raw counts provide dual interpretation
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML export showing detailed cell information
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar implementation with proper categorical ordering
  - Square aspect ratio via coord_fixed() ideal for confusion matrices
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar could be positioned closer to the plot for better visual cohesion
  - Grid/Legend score impacted by colorbar distance from main plot area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4x4 confusion matrix heatmap for an image
    classification task with classes Cat, Dog, Bird, and Fish. The matrix uses a sequential
    blue colormap (light to dark blue gradient) where darker cells indicate higher
    counts. Each cell shows both the raw count and row-normalized percentage in bold
    black or white text (white text on darker cells, black on lighter). The diagonal
    cells (correct predictions) are visibly darker, showing good model performance:
    Cat=45 (77%), Dog=52 (82%), Bird=38 (79%), Fish=41 (80%). Off-diagonal cells show
    realistic misclassification patterns (e.g., Cat↔Dog confusion, Bird↔Fish confusion).
    The title "confusion-matrix · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Y-axis
    labeled "True Label", X-axis labeled "Predicted Label". A colorbar on the right
    shows the count scale from ~10 to 50. The plot uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio
    with coord_fixed().'

        comment: Saves as "plot.png" but also saves "plot.html" which is fine, however
          the code defines df.iterrows() which is slow but acceptable

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, geom_tile, scale_color_identity for text colors,
          tooltips for interactivity (HTML version), coord_fixed(); could leverage
          more lets-plot specific features like custom tooltips formatting
