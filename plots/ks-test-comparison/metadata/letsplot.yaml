review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required features (ECDFs, K-S statistic, maximum
    divergence highlight, p-value, legend, Y-axis 0-1) are present and well-implemented'
  - Strong data storytelling through the purple shaded ribbon and labeled divergence
    point — the visual hierarchy guides the viewer to the key statistical insight
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario with appropriate parameters and sample sizes
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - 'Good visual refinement: custom background, dashed grid, minimal theme, explicit
    font sizing'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Color accessibility could be improved: the blue-red pairing, while having adequate
    luminance contrast, is not optimal for protanopia — consider using blue and orange/amber
    instead'
  - 'Library mastery is generic: the implementation does not leverage any lets-plot-specific
    features that distinguish it from plotnine — consider using lets-plot geom_segment
    with arrow annotations, coord_cartesian, or interactive tooltip capabilities via
    HTML export'
  - Axis labels lack units — Credit Score (points) would be slightly more informative
  - The ribbon shading extends ±60 units around max divergence which is somewhat arbitrary
    — consider shading the full region between the two CDFs or using a more principled
    boundary
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step curves on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. The blue
    line (#306998) represents "Good Customers" and the red/coral line (#E85D4A) represents
    "Bad Customers." The X-axis shows "Credit Score" ranging from 300 to 800+, and
    the Y-axis shows "Cumulative Proportion" from 0 to 1. A purple dashed vertical
    line marks the point of maximum divergence between the two distributions at approximately
    score 555. A semi-transparent purple ribbon shades the region around the maximum
    divergence point (roughly 500-620), visually emphasizing the gap between the two
    CDFs. The label "D = 0.469" is displayed in bold purple text at the midpoint of
    the divergence line. The title reads "ks-test-comparison · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    in bold, with a subtitle showing "K-S Statistic: 0.469 | p-value: 9.52e-38." The
    legend is positioned at the top center. Dashed light gray grid lines provide reference.
    Overall layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
