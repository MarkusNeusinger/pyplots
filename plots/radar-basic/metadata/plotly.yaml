review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Scatterpolar for radar charts with proper fill and line
    styling
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles with no unnecessary complexity
  - Realistic employee performance context that matches spec applications perfectly
  - Proper polygon closure by repeating first value
  - Good font sizing throughout (28pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Single series only; adding a second comparison series would better showcase radar
    chart utility
  - Data values are clustered (72-92); wider spread would demonstrate the chart ability
    to show strengths and weaknesses more dramatically
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - radar chart has generous margins
