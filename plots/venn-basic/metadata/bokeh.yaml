review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen transparency (alpha=0.4) creating distinct
    overlap colors
  - Correct implementation of 3-set Venn diagram with accurate inclusion-exclusion
    calculations
  - Good use of Bokeh patch method for creating smooth circles
  - Proper title format and clean layout without unnecessary axes/grid
  - Interactive HTML output with hover tool
  weaknesses:
  - Set size labels (n=100, n=80, n=60) defined in code but not rendering visibly
    in output image
  - Hover tooltips could display actual region data instead of generic instructions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3-set Venn diagram with three overlapping
    elliptical shapes on a white background. Product A (blue, top-left) shows 60 in
    its exclusive region, Product B (yellow, top-right) shows 35, and Product C (green,
    bottom-center) shows 25. The intersection regions display: A∩B=20 (olive/greenish
    overlap at top-center), A∩C=10 (teal overlap at left), B∩C=15 (light green overlap
    at right), and the triple intersection A∩B∩C=10 (darkest green at center). The
    title "venn-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Set labels "Product
    A", "Product B", and "Product C" are positioned outside their respective circles.
    The diagram uses transparency effectively to show overlapping regions with distinct
    colors.'

        comment: Uses HoverTool for interactivity, patch rendering for circles, Label
          model for text; could leverage more Bokeh features like linked selections
          or custom tooltips with actual data
  verdict: APPROVED
