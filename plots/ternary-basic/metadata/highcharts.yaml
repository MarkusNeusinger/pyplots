review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of custom ternary plot using Highcharts renderer API
    for triangle and grid
  - Well-chosen realistic context (soil composition) with proper Dirichlet-distributed
    data
  - Interactive tooltips showing actual sand/silt/clay percentages for each point
  - Clean visual design with appropriate grid transparency and marker sizing
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function ternary_to_cartesian violates KISS principle (should be inline
    calculation)
  - Legend is disabled when it could display the Soil Samples series name
