review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept using seaborn scatterplot and lineplot
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal) with good visual distinction
  - Appropriate use of edge transparency (alpha=0.25) for visual bundling effect
  - Well-structured data model with realistic software dependency scenario
  - Proper use of Bezier curves for smooth edge rendering through center control point
  - Good axis label positioning at 1.2x radius for clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom portion of canvas has significant whitespace due to asymmetric axis placement
  - Title has two lines which deviates slightly from single-line standard format
