review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast with adaptive color (white on dark, dark blue on light
    cells)
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper layer ordering
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with plausible confusion patterns
  - Square aspect ratio (coord_fixed) perfect for confusion matrix
  - Good use of categorical ordering to control axis display
  - Cell borders (white, size=2) provide clear separation
  weaknesses:
  - Could benefit from displaying percentages alongside or instead of raw counts for
    easier interpretation
  - Legend colorbar title could be more descriptive (e.g., Sample Count)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3×3 confusion matrix heatmap for a sentiment
    analysis classifier with three classes: Negative, Neutral, and Positive. The matrix
    uses a sequential blue colormap (light blue to dark blue) from the Blues palette.
    The diagonal cells (correct predictions) show high values (85, 72, 81) in dark
    blue, while off-diagonal cells show lower misclassification counts in lighter
    shades. Cell values are annotated with bold numbers - white text on dark cells
    and dark blue text on light cells for contrast. The y-axis shows "True Label"
    and x-axis shows "Predicted Label". A colorbar on the right indicates the count
    scale (0-80+). The title follows the required format. The layout is square (1:1
    aspect ratio) with good proportions.'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar (aes, geom_tile, geom_text, scale_fill_gradient,
          coord_fixed, theme_minimal). Could use scale_fill_brewer for more distinctive
          plotnine styling, but current approach is clean.
  verdict: APPROVED
