review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step visualization technique using intermediate points with zero-width
    space labels
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate font scaling for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Perfect real-world scenario (cumulative monthly sales) that naturally fits step
    plots
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent branding
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom appears somewhat small and isolated from the main chart area
  - Could show more dramatic variation in step heights to better demonstrate the plot
    type utility
