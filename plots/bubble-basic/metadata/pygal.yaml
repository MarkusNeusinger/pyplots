review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic, well-chosen data scenario (city population density vs commute time
    with green space)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with perfect reproducibility
  - Creative use of pygal's per-series dots_size to approximate bubble chart behavior
  - Good transparency setting (0.55) and clean white background styling
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Bubble size is discretized into 3 fixed categories rather than being continuously
    mapped, making this more of a categorized scatter plot than a true bubble chart
    — explore if pygal allows per-point size variation
  - No quantitative size legend explaining what the bubble sizes represent numerically
    (the spec explicitly asks for this)
  - The < 20% Green Space category has only ~3 data points, making it barely visible
    and statistically underrepresented — consider adjusting bin boundaries for more
    balanced groups
  - Legend text at the bottom is very small and hard to read despite the font size
    setting
  - Red and orange colors are somewhat similar, which could pose colorblind accessibility
    issues — consider using more distinct colors (e.g., replace red with a darker
    hue)
  - Design could be elevated with more visual refinement and storytelling emphasis
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter/bubble chart on a white background
    with the title "bubble-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top center. The X-axis
    is labeled "Population Density (people/km²)" ranging from approximately 1,000
    to 14,500, and the Y-axis is labeled "Avg Commute Time (min)" ranging from roughly
    17 to 34 minutes. Three series are shown with different colors and dot sizes:
    small red dots for "< 20% Green Space" (about 3 data points), medium orange dots
    for "20-35% Green Space" (about 10 points), and large blue dots for "> 35% Green
    Space" (about 17 points). A subtle dotted grid is visible. The legend appears
    at the bottom in three columns but the text is quite small. A clear positive trend
    is visible — higher population density correlates with longer commute times, and
    cities with lower density tend to have more green space (larger blue dots on the
    left). The overall layout is clean with good use of transparency (alpha ~0.55)
    on the dots.'

        comment: Data shows clear narrative (denser cities = longer commutes, less
          green space). Three-group binning creates visual hierarchy but no annotations
          guide the viewer.

        comment: Per-series dots_size is a pygal-specific feature creatively used
          to simulate bubble sizes. HTML tooltip support is also pygal-native.
