review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including upper triangle masking,
    diverging colormap centered at zero, and correlation annotations
  - Adaptive text coloring (white on dark, black on light backgrounds) ensures excellent
    readability
  - Realistic economic indicator data with believable correlation patterns (Okun's
    Law reflected in GDP-Unemployment)
  - Clean square layout perfectly suited for symmetric matrix visualization
  - Proper colorbar with full -1 to 1 range for consistent interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels say Economic Indicators on both axes which is redundant - could be
    more informative or omitted on one axis
  - Font size of 14pt for cell annotations is adequate but could be slightly larger
    (16pt) for better readability at this image size
