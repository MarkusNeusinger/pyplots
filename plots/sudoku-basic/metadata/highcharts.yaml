review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Sudoku grid visual hierarchy with thick 3×3 box
    boundaries and thin cell lines
  - Clean monochrome design perfectly suited for printing as specified
  - Numbers are well-centered and highly legible at 72px font size
  - Creative use of HTML overlay for drawing grid lines alongside Highcharts scatter
    series
  - Title format matches specification exactly
  - Uses a real, recognizable Sudoku puzzle pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Small artifact visible at bottom edge of image (appears as a thin colored line)
  - 'The thin cell grid lines (gray #999999) could be slightly darker for better visibility
    when printed'
  - Grid lines are rendered via HTML divs rather than native Highcharts features,
    which is less elegant
  image_description: The plot displays a 9×9 Sudoku grid with the title "sudoku-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top in black text. The grid features a clean
    black-and-white design with thick black lines separating the nine 3×3 boxes and
    thin gray lines dividing individual cells. Numbers (1-9) are displayed in bold
    black font, centered within their respective cells. The puzzle shows a partially
    filled Sudoku with numbers like 5,3 in the top-left box, 7 in the top-center area,
    6,1,9,5 in the second row, etc. Empty cells are shown as blank white spaces. The
    overall layout is square with good proportions and the grid fills most of the
    canvas area appropriately.
