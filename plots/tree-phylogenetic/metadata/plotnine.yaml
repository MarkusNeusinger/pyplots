review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering of geom_segment
    for tree branches
  - Well-designed clade color scheme that effectively differentiates evolutionary
    groups
  - Scale bar with proper units (substitutions/site) as required by specification
  - Clean, publication-quality layout using theme_void appropriate for tree diagrams
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny based on real evolutionary relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra text ("Primate Phylogeny") before the spec-id; should
    be just "tree-phylogenetic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
  - Some clade colors (Homininae, Gorillini, Hominini) are identical yellow, making
    it hard to distinguish these clades in the legend
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phylogenetic tree diagram showing primate
    evolutionary relationships. The tree uses a rectangular/cladogram layout with
    horizontal and vertical line segments. Eight species are shown as leaf nodes:
    Lemur (top), Baboon, Macaque, Gibbon, Orangutan, Gorilla, Chimpanzee, and Human
    (bottom). Branch colors indicate different clades: brown for Strepsirrhini (Lemur),
    blue for Haplorrhini/Catarrhini/Hominoidea, red/crimson for Cercopithecidae (Old
    World monkeys), green for Hylobatidae (Gibbon), orange for Ponginae (Orangutan),
    and yellow for Homininae/Gorillini/Hominini (African apes + humans). Blue dots
    mark leaf nodes, with species names in dark gray text to the right. A scale bar
    at the bottom left shows "0.1 substitutions/site". A legend on the right lists
    all 11 clades with their colors. The title "Primate Phylogeny · tree-phylogenetic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is bold and centered at the top.'
