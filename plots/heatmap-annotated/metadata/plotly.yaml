review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly create_annotated_heatmap from figure_factory for native
    annotation support
  - Smart auto-contrast text color logic (white on dark, black on light backgrounds)
  - Custom hover template provides excellent interactivity
  - Realistic financial sector correlation data with proper structure
  - Proper diverging colorscale (RdBu_r) with zmid=0 for correlation data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic Sector - could be Stock Market Sector for more context
  - Colorbar thickness could be slightly larger for the canvas size
  image_description: The plot displays an 8x8 sector correlation matrix heatmap showing
    correlations between stock market sectors (Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Energy,
    Consumer, Industrial, Materials, Utilities). The matrix uses a diverging RdBu
    (Red-Blue) colorscale ranging from -1 (blue) to +1 (red), centered at 0 (white/cream).
    Each cell contains its correlation value formatted to 2 decimal places. The diagonal
    shows perfect correlation (1.00) in dark red. Text annotations use white font
    on dark-colored cells (high absolute correlation) and black font on light-colored
    cells for contrast. The title reads "Sector Correlation Matrix · heatmap-annotated
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top. Both axes are labeled "Sector" with rotated
    x-axis labels at 45 degrees. A colorbar on the right shows the correlation scale.
    The plot has square cells and uses the plotly_white template for a clean background.

          but could leverage more interactive features like click callbacks
