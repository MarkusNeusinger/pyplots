review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lower triangle masking to reduce visual redundancy
  - Smart use of dynamic text colors (white on dark backgrounds, dark on light) for
    optimal readability
  - HoverTool provides interactive capability for HTML version
  - Realistic economic indicator dataset with believable correlation values
  - Proper use of RdBu11 diverging palette centered at zero
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could be more specific (e.g., "Variable" rather than generic "Economic
    Indicators" on both axes)
  - Could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like CustomJS callbacks or interactive
    filtering
