review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all required Bland-Altman components (mean bias line,
    limits of agreement, annotations)
  - Clean declarative Altair code using proper layering of chart elements
  - Good use of tooltips for interactive exploration of data points
  - Realistic medical device validation scenario with appropriate blood pressure data
  - Color scheme provides good contrast between data points (blue) and limit lines
    (yellow)
  - Annotations are well-positioned and clearly formatted with values
  weaknesses:
  - Grid configuration uses gridOpacity=0.3 which is acceptable but could have legend
    explaining the reference lines for publication quality
  - No formal legend element present, though annotations compensate for this
