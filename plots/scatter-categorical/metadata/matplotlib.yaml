review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of different marker shapes (circle, square, triangle) for additional
    category distinction beyond color
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Realistic Iris-like data scenario that is scientifically relevant and neutral
  - White edge colors on markers improve visibility and separation
  - Proper font sizing throughout for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Library features could be more distinctive - matplotlib offers patheffects, custom
    marker paths, or gradient fills that are not utilized
  - Yellow markers with white background could have slightly better contrast
