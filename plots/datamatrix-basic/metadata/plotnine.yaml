review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Data Matrix barcode structure with correct L-shaped
    finder pattern
  - High contrast black/white color scheme ensures maximum readability
  - Proper quiet zone implementation for scanning reliability
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of geom_tile for grid-based visualization
  - Square aspect ratio correctly chosen for barcode format
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels criterion scores 0 but this is appropriate for barcode (criteria designed
    for data plots)
  - Could demonstrate the auto-sizing capability mentioned in spec
  - Data encoding is simulated rather than using actual ECC 200 algorithm (acceptable
    for visualization)
  image_description: The plot displays a 16x16 Data Matrix 2D barcode rendered as
    a grid of black and white square tiles using plotnine's geom_tile. The barcode
    features the characteristic L-shaped finder pattern with solid black cells along
    the entire left edge and bottom edge. The top and right edges show the alternating
    timing pattern (clock pattern) with cells alternating between black and white.
    The interior contains the encoded data pattern representing "SERIAL:12345678",
    created through a deterministic bit manipulation algorithm. A white quiet zone
    (2-module width) surrounds the entire barcode for scanning reliability. The title
    "datamatrix-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue (#306998)
    bold text at 24pt size. The image uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio (3600x3600px
    at 300 DPI) which is appropriate for barcode visualization. No axis labels, ticks,
    grid lines, or legend are shown, as these are correctly hidden for a clean barcode
    presentation. The background is pure white (#FFFFFF) and the barcode cells are
    pure black (#000000) for maximum contrast.

          for binary colors; proper theme customization. Standard usage without advanced
