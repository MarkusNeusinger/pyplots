review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent split violin implementation using path clipping technique (manual vertex
    manipulation)
  - Realistic salary data scenario with meaningful department/gender comparison
  - Clear visual distinction between Male (blue) and Female (yellow) with accessible
    colors
  - Properly formatted quartile markers with high-contrast white+dark edge design
  - Clean KISS code structure with no functions/classes
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could more explicitly indicate that Male is left half and Female is right
    half within each violin
  - 'Implementation header still shows Quality: pending instead of actual score (minor
    metadata issue)'
  image_description: 'The plot displays four split violin plots comparing salary distributions
    between Male (blue, #306998) and Female (yellow, #FFD43B) across Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, and HR departments. Each violin is properly split with the left
    half (Male) and right half (Female) meeting at the center line. The distributions
    show realistic salary patterns with Engineering having the highest salaries (~$40K-$180K
    range), while HR has the lowest (~$30K-$100K range). White horizontal lines with
    dark edges mark the median and quartiles (Q1, Q3) on each half. A legend with
    colored patches appears in the upper left. The title correctly shows "violin-split
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai", y-axis is labeled "Annual Salary ($)" with $K formatting,
    and x-axis shows "Department" with the four category names.'

        comment: Good use of violinplot with manual path clipping to create split
          effect, uses Patch for legend, hlines for quartiles. The split violin technique
          shows matplotlib expertise, but could leverage ax.vlines for additional
          visual elements or fill_between for more sophisticated styling.
  verdict: APPROVED
