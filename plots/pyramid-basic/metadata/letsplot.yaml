review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the pyramid chart concept with proper symmetric axis
    scales
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper ggplot2 grammar
  - Perfect spec compliance including correct title format and all required features
  - Good use of coord_flip() to create horizontal bars with categorical y-axis
  - Custom axis labels showing absolute values on both sides (clever use of scale_y_continuous
    labels)
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with 1600x900 base size scaled 3x
  - Realistic demographic data showing typical population pyramid shape
  weaknesses:
  - Color choice (blue/yellow) while distinguishable could be improved for colorblind
    accessibility - consider using a more standard palette like blue/orange or established
    demographic colors
  - Library-specific features could be leveraged more - lets-plot supports tooltips
    and interactivity that aren't utilized in the HTML output
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid with 9 age groups (0-9
    through 80+) arranged vertically on the y-axis. Male population bars extend to
    the left in a dark blue color (#306998), while female population bars extend to
    the right in yellow (#FFD43B). The x-axis shows "Population (thousands)" with
    symmetric scale from 80 to 0 to 80. The pyramid shape is clearly visible, with
    the widest bars in the 30-39 age group, tapering toward both younger and older
    age groups. The title "pyramid-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    A legend on the right identifies Male (blue) and Female (yellow). The minimal
    theme provides a clean appearance with subtle gridlines.

          position is good but could be closer to the plot

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, coord_flip, scale_y_continuous with custom labels,
          theme customization, ggsize - good usage of lets-plot but no advanced interactive
          features utilized
  verdict: APPROVED
