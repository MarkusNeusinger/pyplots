review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (Q for quantitative)
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate font sizes and gradient dimensions
  - Interactive tooltips enhance data exploration
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Altair interactive capabilities
  - Good marker styling with stroke for point definition
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar/legend title Intensity lacks units - should indicate the measurement
    scale
  - Grid styling could benefit from slightly lower opacity (0.2 instead of 0.3) for
    subtler appearance
  image_description: The plot displays a color-mapped scatter plot with 150 data points.
    The X-axis shows "X Position (units)" (range 0-80) and the Y-axis shows "Y Position
    (units)" (range 0-110). Each point is colored using the viridis colormap representing
    an "Intensity" value (0-100), shown in the colorbar on the right. The color gradient
    ranges from dark purple (low intensity ~0) to bright yellow (high intensity ~100).
    The data exhibits a clear positive correlation where points in the upper-right
    region have higher intensity values. Points have moderate size with subtle dark
    stroke borders and good transparency (opacity ~0.75). The title "scatter-color-mapped
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The layout has balanced margins
    with a well-positioned legend/colorbar.

          however legend title says "Intensity" without units
