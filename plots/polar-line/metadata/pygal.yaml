review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of seasonal temperature data that perfectly demonstrates cyclical
    patterns
  - Clean, professional visual appearance with well-balanced layout
  - Appropriate use of pygal Radar chart as the closest equivalent to polar-line
  - Good color contrast between series (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper title formatting following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Font sizes appropriately scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis labels lack units (should show °C somewhere)
  - Could benefit from more distinct styling or pygal-specific features like custom
    tooltips
  - Month labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full scale
