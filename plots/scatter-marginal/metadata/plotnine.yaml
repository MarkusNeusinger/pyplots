review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine composition API with | and / operators for arranging
    multiple plots
  - Clean, realistic dataset showing study hours vs exam score correlation
  - Proper axis alignment between scatter plot and marginal histograms
  - Good color contrast between blue scatter/top histogram and yellow right histogram
  - Correct title format and well-labeled axes with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling inconsistent between main scatter plot and marginal histograms
  - Top-right spacer creates slight visual imbalance in the layout
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with marginal distributions
    in a 2x2 grid layout. The main scatter plot (bottom-left) shows blue data points
    representing the correlation between Study Hours per Week (x-axis, 0-50) and Exam
    Score (%, y-axis, 30-100). Above it, a blue histogram shows the distribution of
    study hours, centered around 25 hours with a roughly normal distribution. On the
    right side, a yellow/gold histogram shows the exam score distribution in a flipped
    orientation (horizontal bars), displaying a roughly normal distribution. The title
    "scatter-marginal · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The top-right corner
    is an empty spacer. The data shows a clear positive correlation between study
    hours and exam scores.

        comment: Good use of plotnine's composition API (plot_spacer, | and / operators),
          grammar of graphics approach. Could have used faceting or additional ggplot2-like
          features.
  verdict: APPROVED
