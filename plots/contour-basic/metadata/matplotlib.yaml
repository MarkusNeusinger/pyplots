review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of both filled contours and contour lines for clarity as recommended
    in spec
  - Viridis colormap is colorblind-accessible and aesthetically pleasing
  - Contour labels (clabel) with inline formatting improve readability
  - Well-proportioned colorbar with appropriate sizing
  - Clean code following KISS principles with fixed random seed
  - All text is properly sized for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use "X Coordinate (units)" if context were
    more specific)
  - Data uses generic mathematical function rather than a real-world scenario from
    the spec applications (e.g., topographic elevation, temperature distribution)
  - Could leverage more distinctive matplotlib features like custom contour level
    selection or different line styles for specific levels
