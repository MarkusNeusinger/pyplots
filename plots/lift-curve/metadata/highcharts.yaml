review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts plotLines feature for the reference line with label
  - Effective combination of LineSeries for the curve and ScatterSeries for key percentile
    annotations
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (Python blue/yellow)
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle with baseline rate
  - Good data labels on key percentiles showing lift multipliers
  weaknesses:
  - The Random Selection (Lift = 1) label appears to be cut off at the right edge
    of the plot
  - Lift values at 10%, 20%, and 30% are identical (1.52x), which looks artificial;
    the data generation could show more variation
  - Code complexity with regex extraction of JS literal could be simplified
  image_description: 'The plot displays a lift curve for a customer response model.
    It shows a blue line ("Model Lift") starting at approximately 1.52x lift at the
    top left, gradually decreasing as the population targeted percentage increases
    from 0% to 100%. The curve smoothly approaches the horizontal dashed reference
    line at y=1 (labeled "Random Selection (Lift = 1)") near 100% population. Four
    yellow diamond markers highlight key percentiles at 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% with
    lift values displayed (1.52x, 1.52x, 1.52x, and 1.46x respectively). The title
    "lift-curve · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle showing
    "Customer Response Model | Baseline Rate: 65.7%". The Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative
    Lift" (ranging 0.9-1.6) and X-axis shows "Population Targeted (%)" (0-100). A
    legend in the top-right identifies the two series. Colors are Python blue (#306998)
    for the line and Python yellow (#FFD43B) for the diamond markers.'

          better to avoid isolation in corner
