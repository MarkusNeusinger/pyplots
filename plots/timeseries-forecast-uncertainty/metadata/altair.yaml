review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual distinction between historical (solid blue) and forecast (dashed
    orange) lines
  - Well-implemented nested confidence bands with appropriate transparency (0.2 and
    0.35)
  - Vertical rule effectively marks the forecast boundary
  - Clean, declarative Altair code using layer composition
  - Realistic monthly sales data with seasonal patterns and widening uncertainty
  weaknesses:
  - Legend not displaying - Code creates legend entries but they are not visible in
    output. This is a critical spec requirement.
  - Y-axis scale ignored - Code sets domain=[50, 270] but output shows 0-280, wasting
    ~35% of vertical space
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series spanning from January 2021 to
    late 2024. Historical data (36 months) is shown as a solid blue line (#306998)
    exhibiting clear seasonal oscillations and an upward trend, starting around 105
    and rising to approximately 170 by the end of 2023. A vertical dashed gray line
    marks the forecast boundary at January 2024. The forecast period (12 months) uses
    an orange dashed line (#E67E22) showing continued growth from ~170 to ~210. Two
    nested shaded bands in yellow/gold (#FFD43B) represent confidence intervals that
    widen progressively: the darker inner band (80% CI, opacity 0.35) and lighter
    outer band (95% CI, opacity 0.2). The title reads "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty
    · altair · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Monthly Sales with 80% and 95% Confidence
    Intervals". The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands USD)" and ranges from 0 to
    280. The X-axis shows "Date" with year/month labels. CRITICAL ISSUE: No legend
    is visible despite the code attempting to create one. The Y-axis also starts at
    0, wasting significant vertical space since data ranges from ~100-240.'
