review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized candlesticks and readable text
  - Correct OHLC data representation with distinct bodies and wicks
  - Good data generation showing realistic stock price movement with trend
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Well-positioned legend that does not obscure data
  - Subtle y-axis grid aids price level reading
  weaknesses:
  - Code specifies colorblind-safe blue/orange colors but plot renders green/red (color
    variable assignment mismatch)
  - Structure uses for loops and functions rather than pure KISS linear style
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 trading days
    of stock price data from January 2 to approximately February 10, 2024. The chart
    uses **green** for bullish (up) candles and **red** for bearish (down) candles
    - this is the traditional green/red color scheme, NOT the colorblind-safe blue/orange
    mentioned in the code. The y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately
    133 to 160. The x-axis shows "Date" with tick labels at 5-day intervals (Jan 02,
    Jan 09, Jan 16, Jan 23, Jan 30, Feb 06). The title correctly displays "candlestick-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend in the upper left shows "Bullish (Up)" in green
    and "Bearish (Down)" in red. The data shows a general downward trend from ~$150
    to ~$135 with both bullish and bearish periods clearly visible. Wicks (shadows)
    are clearly visible and thinner than the candle bodies. A subtle horizontal grid
    helps read price levels.

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme, sns.set_context, sns.lineplot for wicks, but
          candlestick is not a native seaborn chart type so relies on matplotlib primitives
  verdict: APPROVED
