review:
  strengths:
  - Correct mathematical implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation
  - Clear visual separation of the three species clusters
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.4) to reveal density patterns
  - Proper data normalization before transformation
  - Clean, well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of pygal XY chart and custom styling
  - Realistic Iris-like dataset with plausible measurements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels at bottom are too small to read clearly; font sizes need significant
    increase for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Yellow curves on white background lack sufficient contrast compared to blue and
    red
  - The stroke parameter on line 115 may not work as intended (should use stroke style
    attribute)
