review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly's barpolar trace type for creating the rose chart
  - Proper clockwise direction with rotation starting at 12 o'clock position (as spec
    recommends for time data)
  - Beautiful Python-themed color gradient (yellow to blue) that is colorblind-accessible
  - White borders between segments enhance visual distinction
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output, leveraging plotly's interactivity
  - Custom hover template with mm units provides useful tooltip information
  - Radial axis tick suffix mm makes values self-documenting
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis label text is angled and slightly harder to read than if horizontal
  - Data range is somewhat narrow (35-85mm); more extreme variation would better showcase
    the plot type
  - Could add a subtitle or annotation explaining the data context
  image_description: The plot displays a rose/coxcomb chart showing monthly rainfall
    data. It features 12 wedge-shaped segments arranged in a circle, one for each
    month (Jan through Dec), starting from the top at 12 o'clock position and proceeding
    clockwise. The segments' radii correspond to rainfall values in mm. The color
    scheme transitions from yellow (Python Yellow, ~#FFD43B) for lower values to blue
    (Python Blue, ~#306998) for higher values. July has the smallest radius (~35mm,
    yellow), while December has the largest (~85mm, blue). Radial gridlines at 0,
    20, 40, 60, and 80 mm help gauge values. The title "rose-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    appears centered at the top. Month labels are positioned around the outer edge
    of the chart. The overall layout is clean with a white background.

        comment: Uses barpolar for rose chart, hover template for interactivity, and
          exports HTML version; could leverage more plotly-specific features like
          animations or custom hover data
  verdict: APPROVED
