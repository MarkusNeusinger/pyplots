review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of seaborn stripplot with jitter for SHAP value distribution visualization
  - Correct coolwarm diverging colormap from blue (low) to red (high) feature values
  - Features properly sorted by importance with most important at top
  - Clean vertical reference line at x=0 clearly separates positive and negative impacts
  - Well-placed colorbar with clear labeling for feature value interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Consider using slightly larger marker size (s=10-12) for better visibility of
    individual points
