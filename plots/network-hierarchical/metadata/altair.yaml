quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical layout algorithm with subtree-width-based positioning
  - Good color scheme using Python colors (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of layer composition for edges, nodes, and labels
  - Custom legend with human-readable level names using labelExpr
  - Interactive tooltips for hover information
  - Title and subtitle follow the correct format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom-level labels are crowded - some adjacent labels nearly touch each other
  - Saves both PNG and HTML but specification only requires PNG output
  - Layout calculation code is complex (necessary for the algorithm but reduces simplicity)
  image_description: 'The plot shows a hierarchical organizational chart with 30 nodes
    arranged across 4 vertical levels (CEO at top, VPs, Directors, and Managers/Leads
    at bottom). Nodes are represented as circles with white strokes. Color coding
    by level: dark blue (#306998) for Executive (CEO), lighter blue (#4B8BBE) for
    VPs, yellow (#FFD43B) for Directors, and gray (#646464) for Managers. Gray edges
    connect parent-child relationships as straight lines with ~40% opacity. Labels
    appear above each node in dark gray text. The legend on the right shows the 4
    levels (Executive, VP, Director, Manager). Title follows the correct format with
    a subtitle explaining the data context. The tree layout properly positions nodes
    to avoid overlap with subtree-width-based horizontal spacing.'
