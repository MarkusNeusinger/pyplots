review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data storytelling: subtitle communicates the insight, data patterns
    are immediately visible through color intensity'
  - Adaptive data label colors (white on dark cells, dark on light cells) significantly
    improve readability
  - Custom 7-stop color gradient creates smooth, publication-quality color transitions
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed grid lines, tick marks, and spines; cell borders
    in background color'
  - Realistic and well-shaped website traffic data with clear weekday/weekend and
    day/night patterns
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (annotations, colorbar, logical
    ordering)
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (e.g., viridis or YlGnBu instead
    of YlOrRd)
  - Axis labels 'Day of Week' and 'Time Period' are functional but generic
  image_description: 'The plot displays a heatmap of website traffic (visits per hour)
    across a 7-day × 8-time-period matrix. The x-axis shows days of the week (Mon–Sun)
    and the y-axis shows time periods from "6–9 AM" at the top to "3–6 AM" at the
    bottom. Each cell is colored on a sequential yellow-to-red scale: pale yellow
    for low values (~0–15), through orange (~30–60), to deep crimson/dark red for
    high values (~80–100). Every cell contains a bold numeric annotation showing the
    exact visits/hr value, with white text on dark cells and dark text on light cells
    for readability. The title reads "Website Traffic · heatmap-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Visits per hour — weekday business hours show clear
    peak activity." A vertical color bar legend labeled "Visits / hr" with scale 0–100
    sits on the right. The background is a light off-white (#fafafa). Clear patterns
    are visible: weekday 9AM–6PM block shows the highest traffic (orange-red, values
    50–100), the Friday 9AM–Noon cell hits the maximum of 100, nighttime hours (Mid–3AM,
    3–6AM) are consistently pale yellow (4–13), and weekends show reduced daytime
    traffic compared to weekdays.'
