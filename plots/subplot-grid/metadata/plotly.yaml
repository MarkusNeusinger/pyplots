review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of Plotly's make_subplots capability with different chart
    types in each cell
  - Well-chosen financial dashboard scenario that naturally requires multiple visualization
    types
  - Clean color scheme using Python blue (#306998) and yellow (#FFD43B) consistently
  - Proper use of specs parameter to define chart types per cell
  - Good axis labeling with units throughout
  - Interactive HTML export alongside static PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines would improve readability of individual subplots (add gridcolor
    and showgrid to axes)
  - Scatter markers in bottom-right subplot could be slightly larger (12-14 instead
    of 10) for better visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid of financial dashboard visualizations
    with a clean white background. **Top-left**: A line chart showing stock price
    (blue solid line ~$80-110 range) with a 20-day moving average (yellow dashed line)
    over dates from Jan 7 to Feb 25, 2024. **Top-right**: A bar chart showing trading
    volume (green/red bars for positive/negative returns, range 0-3M). **Bottom-left**:
    A histogram of daily returns distribution (blue bars, roughly normal distribution
    from -4% to +4%). **Bottom-right**: A scatter plot showing price vs volume relationship
    (blue dots). The main title "subplot-grid · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top. A legend is positioned on the right side showing all series. All subplot
    titles are clearly visible and axis labels include units where appropriate.'

        comment: Uses make_subplots with specs for different chart types, plotly_white
          template, and HTML export for interactivity. Could have leveraged more Plotly-specific
          features like hover customization or shared axes between subplots.
