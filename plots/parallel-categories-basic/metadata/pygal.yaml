review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent parallel categories visualization with clear flow ribbons connecting
    four dimensions
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each product category
  - Well-proportioned ribbons showing customer journey flows with appropriate opacity
  - Clean layout with dimension labels at top and category labels positioned outside
    bars
  - Realistic e-commerce scenario with plausible purchase journey data
  weaknesses:
  - Middle dimension category labels (Channel, Payment) are positioned below bars
    but could overlap with ribbons in denser visualizations
  - Cancelled outcome label at bottom right is quite small and harder to read than
    other labels
