review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh Band glyph for confidence intervals with appropriate transparency
  - Color scheme (Python blue and golden yellow) provides excellent visual distinction
    and colorblind accessibility
  - Clean mathematical formulation for realistic learning curve behavior
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears too small despite 26pt setting; consider increasing to 32pt+
    for better visibility at 4800x2700 canvas resolution
