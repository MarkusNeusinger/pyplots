review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range selector buttons using FancyBboxPatch with proper
    styling
  - Clean visual hierarchy with active button clearly highlighted
  - Realistic financial data with trend, noise, and seasonal components
  - Good use of fill_between for visual appeal
  - Date range subtitle provides clear context
  - Proper figure coordinate transforms for button positioning
  weaknesses:
  - Buttons partially overlap with the title text at the top
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Value ($)" or "Price (USD)")
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series line chart showing financial-like
    data over a 3-month period (Oct 02, 2024 - Dec 31, 2024). At the top of the figure
    are six range selector buttons: 1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, and All. The "3M" button
    is highlighted in a blue color (#306998) with white text, indicating it is the
    active selection, while the other buttons are styled with a light gray background
    and darker gray text. Below the buttons, a subtitle shows the current date range.
    The main chart displays a blue line (same #306998 color) with an area fill beneath
    it at 15% opacity. The line shows an upward trend from approximately 132 to 145,
    with realistic price-like fluctuations. The y-axis is labeled "Value" and the
    x-axis is labeled "Date" with dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD and rotated at 30
    degrees. A subtle dashed grid is visible. The title reads "line-range-buttons
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format.'

        comment: Good use of matplotlib.patches.FancyBboxPatch for buttons, fill_between
          for area, figure-level transforms for button positioning; could have used
          more advanced features
