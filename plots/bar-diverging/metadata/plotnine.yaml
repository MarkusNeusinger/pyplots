review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of coord_flip() for horizontal bars with readable category labels
  - Clean implementation of the zero baseline with geom_hline()
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical to maintain sorted order
  - Good color choice with blue (#306998) and coral (#E74C3C) for positive/negative
    distinction
  - Comprehensive theme customization for publication-quality output
  - Realistic customer satisfaction survey scenario with meaningful categories
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement could be closer to the plot area to reduce whitespace on the
    right
  - Could use a diverging Brewer palette (e.g., RdBu) for better colorblind accessibility
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing customer
    satisfaction survey results across 12 product categories. Blue bars extend to
    the right for positive net satisfaction scores (Mobile App at ~72%, Customer Service
    at ~45%, Website at ~38%, Delivery Speed at ~25%, Product Quality at ~18%, Pricing
    at ~8%), while coral/red bars extend to the left for negative scores (Return Policy
    at ~-5%, Packaging at ~-12%, Email Support at ~-22%, Chat Support at ~-35%, Documentation
    at ~-48%, Warranty at ~-62%). A clear vertical baseline at zero separates positive
    from negative values. The title "bar-diverging · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Product Category" and the X-axis is labeled
    "Net Satisfaction Score (%)". A legend on the right shows "Sentiment" with Negative
    (coral) and Positive (blue) indicators. The bars are sorted by value from highest
    (Mobile App) to lowest (Warranty), and the layout uses a clean minimal theme with
    subtle gridlines.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_bar, coord_flip, scale_fill_manual,
          theme customization - solid plotnine usage but nothing exceptional like
          facets or statistical layers
  verdict: APPROVED
