review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and colorblind-safe
    palette
  - Correct implementation of ROC curve with all required features (diagonal reference,
    AUC in legend, multiple models)
  - Uses coord_fixed(ratio=1) for equal aspect ratio as recommended in spec
  - Clean ggplot grammar of graphics approach with appropriate theme customization
  - Proper scale 3x export for 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a function definition (compute_roc) which violates the KISS principle
    - should be inline calculations
  - Grid alpha not explicitly set (could be more subtle)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an ROC curve visualization with three curves
    on a 16:9 aspect ratio canvas. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with a light
    gray grid. The title "roc-curve · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top.
    The X-axis shows "False Positive Rate" (0 to 1) and the Y-axis shows "True Positive
    Rate" (0 to 1). Three curves are shown:

    - **Model A (AUC = 0.97)** - Blue curve (#306998) showing excellent classifier
    performance, hugging the top-left corner

    - **Model B (AUC = 0.71)** - Yellow/gold curve (#FFD43B) showing moderate classifier
    performance

    - **Random (AUC = 0.50)** - Gray diagonal line (#888888) representing the random
    baseline

    The legend is positioned at the bottom with the label "Classifier". The plot has
    equal 1:1 aspect ratio for the axes (coord_fixed). All text is legible and appropriately
    sized. Lines are thick enough (size=2) to be clearly visible.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (ggplot, aes, geom_line), coord_fixed for aspect
          ratio, scale_color_manual, theme_minimal, ggsize - good library usage but
          nothing particularly unique to lets-plot
  verdict: APPROVED
