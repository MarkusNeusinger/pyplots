quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging color scale (blue-yellow-red) that clearly shows low,
    medium, and high performance
  - Value annotations in each cell make the exact scores easily readable
  - Clean, professional layout with proper title format
  - Good realistic data scenario (department performance by quarter)
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical to maintain axis ordering
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis department labels at 45-degree angle could be more readable if horizontal
    or using a different layout
  - White text on yellow cells (mid-range values) has slightly reduced contrast
  - The data does not show any clear patterns or clustering as mentioned in the spec
