review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with realistic seasonal retail patterns that make
    the heatmap informative and engaging
  - Publication-quality typography using serif fonts (Palatino/Georgia) with carefully
    set font sizes at every level
  - Diverging RdBu colorscale centered at zero with signed numeric annotations in
    every cell — clear and informative
  - Clean code structure with appropriate data generation complexity for realistic
    seasonal patterns
  - Plotly-idiomatic usage of hovertemplate, texttemplate, and HTML export alongside
    static PNG
  weaknesses:
  - Right margin slightly tight — colorbar Sales Growth title is close to the canvas
    edge; increasing right margin or adjusting colorbar position would improve balance
  - Could leverage more distinctive Plotly features (e.g., custom hoverinfo with category-specific
    details, or zmin/zmax for symmetric range)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8×12 heatmap of monthly sales growth percentages
    across retail product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Food & Beverage, Books,
    Sports, Home & Garden, Beauty, Toys) over 12 months (Jan–Dec). A diverging RdBu
    colorscale is used, centered at zero: deep red cells indicate strong positive
    growth (up to ~30%), deep blue cells indicate strong negative growth (down to
    ~-21%), and near-white cells are close to zero. Every cell contains a signed numeric
    annotation (e.g., "+20.2", "-15.3"). The title reads "Monthly Sales Growth · heatmap-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" with a gray subtitle describing seasonal patterns. Axes
    are labeled "Month" (x) and "Product Category" (y). A vertical colorbar on the
    right shows "Sales Growth (%)" with percentage tick marks. Cells are separated
    by small gaps. The background is a light off-white (#fafafa), and the typography
    uses a serif font (Palatino/Georgia). The layout is landscape format at 1600×900
    (scaled 3×).'
