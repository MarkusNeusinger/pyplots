review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data storytelling: peak annotation, subtitle narrative, weekend bands
    all reinforce the story'
  - Gradient fill from semi-opaque to transparent is visually appealing and matches
    spec recommendation
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Idiomatic Highcharts usage with distinctive features (plotBands, plotLines, crosshair)
  - Realistic data scenario with plausible traffic patterns (weekly cycle, growth
    trend, noise)
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom margin (300px) is slightly generous, creating some wasted space below the
    x-axis
  - Y-axis range extends above the peak line, leaving some unused whitespace at top
  - Could benefit from one additional storytelling element (e.g., marking the lowest
    point or adding a trend line)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart titled "area-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle "Daily Website Visitors Over One Month — Weekend
    Dips with Steady Growth". The chart uses a single series in Python Blue (#306998)
    with a gradient fill that transitions from semi-opaque blue at the line to nearly
    transparent at the bottom. Small circular markers with white borders appear at
    each of the 30 data points. The x-axis shows "Day of Month" (1–30) and the y-axis
    shows "Daily Visitors" (1,500–3,900). Light blue vertical bands highlight weekend
    days. A red dotted horizontal line near the top marks the peak at "▲ Peak: 3,734
    visitors (Day 30)". The legend in the top-right reads "Website Visitors". Subtle
    gridlines at 8% opacity guide value estimation. The data exhibits a clear upward
    growth trend with periodic weekly dips, starting around 2,400 visitors and climbing
    to ~3,700 by day 30.'
