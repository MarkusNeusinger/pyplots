review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using two separate pygal charts combined with PIL to achieve
    navigator functionality
  - Excellent use of pygal Style for consistent, professional appearance
  - Good colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/orange)
  - Appropriate data scale with 1095 points demonstrating large dataset handling
  - Proper title format on main chart
  - HTML output also generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels in main chart are slightly crowded despite label sampling
  - Navigator title uses different format than main chart (not matching spec-id format)
  - The workaround with PIL adds complexity that deviates from KISS principle
  - 'Pygal limitation: cannot implement truly interactive draggable selection handles
    (static PNG only)'
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with a mini navigator design.
    The main chart at the top shows a blue line representing sensor readings (in mV)
    over a selected date range from Feb 2023 to Aug 2023. The line shows significant
    variability with values ranging roughly from 45 to 92 mV. The x-axis displays
    dates in YYYY-MM-DD format rotated 45 degrees, and the y-axis shows "Sensor Reading
    (mV)". The title correctly shows "line-navigator · pygal · pyplots.ai". Below
    the main chart is a smaller navigator panel with a gray background, titled "Navigator
    - Full Data Range (2022-2024)". This navigator shows the full dataset as a light
    blue filled area and highlights the selected range (Feb 2023 - Aug 2023) in orange.
    The legend at the bottom clearly identifies both series. The two-chart composition
    effectively demonstrates the navigator concept.
