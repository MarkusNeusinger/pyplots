review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper segment proportions and gaps
  - Creative use of Altair mark_line with filled=True to create arc shapes
  - Well-implemented Bezier curves for ribbon connections
  - Good color palette that maintains segment identity throughout
  - Inner track provides additional data dimension with darker shades
  - Clean readable code structure with clear data definitions
  - Tooltips added to ribbons for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Some ribbons in the center appear slightly congested making individual connections
    harder to trace
  - Inner track bars could have more visible separation from each other
  - Legend shows segment colors but not inner track or ribbon meaning
