review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, color gradient,
    error bars, and value annotations'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper grammar of graphics
    structure
  - Well-chosen loan default prediction scenario with realistic feature names and
    importance values
  - Good use of coord_flip() for horizontal bars with readable feature names
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700 px)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned far from the main plot area, creating visual disconnect
  - Missing random seed even though data is deterministic (minor but good practice)
