review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wind rose using manual polygon geometry in plotnine
  - Clean color progression from cool (calm) to warm (strong winds) following meteorological
    convention
  - North correctly positioned at top (90 degrees in mathematical coordinates)
  - Well-organized code with clear data structure and meaningful comments
  - Appropriate use of categorical ordering for legend consistency
  - Good gridline design with dashed style and appropriate transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Frequency percentages positioning could be improved - labels are slightly offset
    and may be confusing
  - Small innermost wedge segments are harder to visually distinguish due to their
    size
