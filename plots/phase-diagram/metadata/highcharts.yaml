review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent physics application with analytically correct damped harmonic oscillator
    equations
  - Three distinct trajectories from different initial conditions clearly demonstrate
    basin of attraction
  - Fixed point marked prominently with distinctive red diamond marker
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple) provides good visual distinction
  - Interactive HTML version also saved for exploration
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Position x (m)" and "Velocity dx/dt (m/s)")
  - Specification suggests adding direction arrows or color gradient to show time
    evolution - not implemented
  - Y-axis tick labels are somewhat crowded with 0.25 increments
  image_description: 'The plot displays a phase diagram showing three spiral trajectories
    converging toward a central equilibrium point. The title "phase-diagram · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Damped Harmonic Oscillator
    - Phase Space Trajectories". The x-axis is labeled "Position x" (ranging from
    approximately -2.4 to 3), and the y-axis is labeled "Velocity dx/dt" (ranging
    from approximately -6 to 4.75). Three distinct colored trajectories are shown:
    blue (High energy start), yellow (Medium energy start), and purple (Low energy
    start), all spiraling inward toward the origin. A red diamond marker indicates
    the equilibrium (fixed point) at the origin. The legend is positioned on the right
    side with clear labels. Grid lines are light gray, and dashed reference lines
    mark the zero axes. The background is white.'
