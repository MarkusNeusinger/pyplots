review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh's varea glyph for the filled area effect
  - Clean implementation with ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Interactive HTML output with HoverTool showing formatted visitor counts
  - Proper font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and low alpha
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with seasonal variation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Website Visitors (count)" or "Month of Year")
  - Could use more distinctive Bokeh features like CustomJS, band annotations, or
    span annotations to highlight peaks
  image_description: The plot shows a filled line chart displaying website traffic
    (visitors) over 12 months. The area beneath the line is filled with a semi-transparent
    blue color (#306998 with alpha 0.4). A solid blue line traces the top of the filled
    area, with small circular markers at each data point. The chart shows a seasonal
    pattern peaking around month 7 (July) at approximately 81,000 visitors, with lower
    values at the start (~40,000) and end (~57,000) of the year. The background is
    a light gray (#fafafa), and there is a subtle dashed grid. The title "line-filled
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left. The x-axis shows months 1-12 labeled
    as "Month", and the y-axis shows "Website Visitors" ranging from 0 to ~80,000.
    Bokeh toolbar icons are visible in the top-right corner.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and HoverTool for interactivity, varea for
          fill; could leverage more Bokeh-specific features like CustomJS callbacks
          or more advanced tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
