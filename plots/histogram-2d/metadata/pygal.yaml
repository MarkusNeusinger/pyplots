review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of marginal histograms as specified in the notes (optional
    feature implemented)
  - Viridis colormap correctly implemented with smooth interpolation
  - Clean colorbar with proper tick marks and Count label
  - Realistic market research scenario with two distinct customer clusters
  - Proper handling of pygal SVG output with cairosvg for PNG conversion
  - Square format appropriate for this symmetrical bivariate visualization
  - All text properly sized and readable
  - Title follows exact required format
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on manual SVG construction rather than pygal native chart capabilities
  - No grid lines on the heatmap (could help with reading exact positions)
  - sys.path manipulation in code is non-standard
