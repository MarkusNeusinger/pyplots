review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper KISS pattern
  - Good use of pygal Custom Style to simulate map-like appearance
  - Colorblind-accessible palette (orange, teal, purple)
  - Meaningful data grouping by visitor count ranges
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriate margins
  - Good axis labels with degree notation
  weaknesses:
  - 'Fundamental limitation: Pygal cannot render actual tile-based map backgrounds
    - the spec requires OpenStreetMap/Stamen/satellite tiles which pygal has no capability
    to display'
  - This implementation is essentially a scatter plot with map-inspired colors, not
    a true tile map
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart on a 4800×2700 canvas with
    an OSM-inspired color scheme: light blue (#aad3df) background representing ocean
    and beige (#f2efe9) plot area representing land. Fifteen European landmark locations
    are plotted using longitude (X-axis, -3° to 26°) and latitude (Y-axis, 35° to
    55°). Data points are grouped into three color-coded series by visitor count:
    orange dots for 1,300K-2,999K visitors/year, teal/green dots for 3,000K-5,999K
    visitors/year, and purple dots for 6,000K-9,600K visitors/year. Dot sizes vary
    by category (16, 22, 28 respectively). The title "map-tile-background · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels include units. A legend at the bottom
    identifies the three visitor categories. Subtle beige/tan grid lines are visible.
    The plot uses good canvas utilization with proper margins.'
