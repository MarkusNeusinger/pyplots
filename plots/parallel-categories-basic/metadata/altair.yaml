review:
  strengths:
  - Column headers now correctly positioned above boxes, improving readability
  - Creative bezier curve implementation for smooth flow ribbons
  - Excellent customer journey e-commerce data scenario demonstrating the parallel
    categories concept
  - Good layered composition using Altair declarative approach
  - Flow Colors legend added to explain channel-to-color mapping
  - Proper title format and dual output (PNG + HTML)
  weaknesses:
  - Category and Outcome columns use uniform grey instead of distinct colors per category,
    reducing visual interest
  - Some thinner flow ribbons are harder to trace across the full diagram
  - Count labels positioned to the right of boxes overlap with ribbon starting points
    on some boxes
