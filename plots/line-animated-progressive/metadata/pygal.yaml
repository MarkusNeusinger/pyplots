review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of small multiples to show progressive data reveal for
    a library without native animation
  - Consistent y-axis range across all panels enables direct visual comparison
  - Clean 2x2 grid layout that clearly communicates the progressive storytelling concept
  - Generates both PNG (small multiples) and HTML (interactive overlay) outputs
  - Good use of cubic interpolation for smooth line appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Missing visual indicator on the current/most recent data point in each panel (spec
    mentions trailing highlight/glow)
  - Panel subtitles could be clearer or integrated into panel titles
  - Code uses PIL for compositing which adds complexity
  image_description: |-
    The plot shows a 2x2 grid of small multiples displaying the progressive buildup of a line chart for monthly website traffic data. The main title "line-animated-progressive · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. Each panel shows the same y-axis (Visitors, ranging from ~50,000 to ~80,000) and x-axis (months Jan-Dec).

    - Top-left (Stage 1: Q1 Data): Shows only January-March data with a blue line and dots, the rest of the x-axis is empty
    - Top-right (Stage 2: H1 Data): Shows January-June data progressively extending further
    - Bottom-left (Stage 3: 9 Months): Shows January-September data
    - Bottom-right (Stage 4: Full Year): Shows the complete 12-month dataset

    The line is rendered in a Python blue color (#306998) with visible dots at each data point. Lines are smooth (cubic interpolation). Y-axis labels show "Visitors" with numeric values. X-axis subtitles indicate the time range for each panel. Gray horizontal grid lines are visible in each panel.
