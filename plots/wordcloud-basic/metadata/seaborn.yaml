review:
  strengths:
  - Realistic tech industry survey data provides meaningful context for the word cloud
  - Good frequency range in data (16-150) creates visual hierarchy
  - Uses seaborn color palette and theming capabilities appropriately
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Creative approach using scatterplot as background with text overlay
  - Appropriate canvas utilization and overall layout balance
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Severe word overlap in center row - Data, Python, Machine merge together,
    significantly hurting readability'
  - 'Title format incorrect: includes Tech Skills Survey prefix instead of using exact
    {spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai format'
  - Grid-based word layout does not provide enough spacing between words, especially
    for the most frequent terms
  - Not all 30 words from the data dictionary are clearly visible in the output
  - Font size scaling (18-48pt range) does not provide enough differentiation for
    lower-frequency words
