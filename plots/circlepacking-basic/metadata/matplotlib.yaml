review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with proper nesting and containment
  - Smart use of square figure format (12x12) appropriate for circular visualization
  - 'Colorblind-safe palette with good visual hierarchy (root: muted blue, departments:
    bright yellow, teams: light blue)'
  - Proper area-based sizing using sqrt scaling for accurate visual perception
  - Clean implementation of painter's algorithm (drawing larger circles first)
  - Realistic organizational data that makes the visualization immediately understandable
  - Well-positioned legend that doesn't interfere with the visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Team-level circles lack labels (only circles with radius > 30 get labels), making
    it hard to identify specific teams
  - Could benefit from showing team names at least for the larger team circles (e.g.,
    Backend at 35 employees)
