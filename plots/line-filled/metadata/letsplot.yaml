review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_area + geom_line + geom_point combination for a complete
    filled line visualization
  - Perfect title format and well-chosen realistic data context (website traffic)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility seed
  - Good visual balance with appropriate fill transparency (0.4) and line visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Month (2024)" or "Visitors (thousands)")
  - Data variation could be more pronounced to better showcase the filled area effect
