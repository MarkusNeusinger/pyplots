quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of diverging bar chart following all spec requirements
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types and sorting
  - Good color choice with Python blue/yellow that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper zero baseline rule layered on top of bars
  - Interactive tooltips and HTML export leverage Altair web-native capabilities
  - Well-sized text elements for readability at target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom-right creates slight visual imbalance; could be positioned
    closer to the chart or at top
  - Realistic context score slightly reduced - while customer satisfaction is valid,
    the exact score values feel somewhat arbitrary
