review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of logistic regression with all required components (sigmoid
    curve, CI, threshold, annotations)
  - Professional appearance with proper sizing and readable text
  - Implements bootstrap confidence intervals, showing good statistical practice
  - Custom legend handles provide clean, comprehensive labeling
  - Model coefficients and accuracy annotation adds value
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette (yellow/blue) not optimally colorblind-safe; consider using seaborn
    colorblind palette
  - Axis labels could include units or more domain-specific context
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib for curve/CI rather than seaborn-native functions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression visualization with a
    characteristic S-shaped sigmoid curve in blue. Data points are colored by their
    binary class: yellow/gold circles for class 0 (clustered around y=0 with slight
    jitter) and blue circles for class 1 (clustered around y=1 with slight jitter).
    The fitted logistic curve spans from approximately probability 0.01 at x=-3.5
    to probability 0.99 at x=3.5. A semi-transparent light blue confidence band (95%
    CI) surrounds the curve, widening slightly at the extremes. A horizontal gray
    dashed line at p=0.5 indicates the decision threshold. The title reads "logistic-regression
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axis labels show "Predictor Variable (X)" on the x-axis
    and "Probability" on the y-axis. A legend in the upper-left identifies all elements.
    Model metrics (Accuracy: 86.5%, Coef: 1.44, Intercept: 0.58) are annotated in
    the bottom-right corner.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with hue parameter and sns.set_style, but curve
          and CI drawn with matplotlib directly; could use seaborn regplot or more
          seaborn-native approaches
