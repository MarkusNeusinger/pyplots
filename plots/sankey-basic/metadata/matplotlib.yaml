review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib Sankey module with two connected diagrams showing
    realistic energy flow scenario
  - Clear color distinction between input sources (blue) and output distribution (yellow)
    aids comprehension
  - All labels include both descriptive names and quantitative values with units (TWh)
  - Energy balance is mathematically verified in code (300 TWh in = 200 TWh out +
    100 TWh losses)
  - Clean layout with axes turned off and informative subtitle explaining the flow
    pattern
  - Appropriate font sizes (18pt labels, 26pt title) ensure readability at full resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit legend to explain that blue represents primary energy sources
    and yellow represents end-use distribution
  - The assert statement adds slight complexity that could be replaced with a comment
  image_description: "The plot displays a Sankey diagram illustrating national energy\
    \ flow. The diagram uses two distinct colors: blue (steel blue #306998) for the\
    \ primary energy sources and losses, and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for the end-use\
    \ distribution. \n\n**Left side (blue flows):** Four input sources flow into a\
    \ central hub - Coal (120 TWh) from the bottom, Natural Gas (90 TWh) from the\
    \ left, Nuclear (60 TWh) from the top, and Renewables (30 TWh) from the top-left.\
    \ A Losses branch (100 TWh) exits downward from the hub.\n\n**Right side (yellow\
    \ flows):** The remaining 200 TWh flows to four end-use sectors - Industrial (80\
    \ TWh) upward, Transport (20 TWh) upper-right, Commercial (45 TWh) rightward,\
    \ and Residential (55 TWh) downward.\n\n**Title:** \"National Energy Flow · sankey-basic\
    \ · matplotlib · pyplots.ai\" at the top in bold.\n**Subtitle:** Italicized explanatory\
    \ text at the bottom describing the flow pattern.\n**Labels:** Each flow is labeled\
    \ with its name and TWh value in bold 18pt font.\n**Layout:** Clean white background,\
    \ axes are turned off, good use of canvas space."
