review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly slider component with well-configured steps and currentvalue
    display
  - Clean, professional visual design with properly sized fonts and good color choice
  - Realistic business scenario (quarterly sales) that demonstrates the slider year-filtering
    capability
  - Dynamic title updates when slider changes year
  - Helpful annotation text guiding users to interact with the slider
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too faint (alpha=0.1 effectively invisible) - should be more visible
    (alpha 0.2-0.3)
  - Spec mentions play/pause animation option if supported - Plotly supports this
    but it was not implemented
