review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of facet_grid for creating the scatter matrix structure
  - Diagonal panels show density plots by species which is appropriate for pairplot
  - Color scheme with three distinct colors for species is visually clear and distinguishable
  - 'Title follows correct format: scatter-matrix · plotnine · pyplots.ai'
  - Realistic Iris-like data with appropriate variable names and units
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels in bottom row are rotated 45 degrees causing slight overlap
    and cramped appearance
  - Variable order is inconsistent - columns show Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal
    Length, Sepal Width but rows show reverse order
  - Scatter points in off-diagonal cells appear somewhat small relative to the panel
    size, could be slightly larger for better visibility
