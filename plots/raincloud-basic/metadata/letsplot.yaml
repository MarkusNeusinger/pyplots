review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of raincloud plot purpose with bimodal Treatment B distribution
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of show_half=1 parameter for half-violin effect
  - Good color palette that is both aesthetically pleasing and accessible
  - Realistic reaction time data scenario with meaningful group differences
  - Proper layering of elements (violin → boxplot → jitter)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is hidden entirely (show_legend=False on all geoms) - while x-axis labels
    exist, a small legend would improve quick identification of color-condition mapping
  - Does not leverage distinctive lets-plot features like tooltips or interactivity
    that would add value in the HTML output
