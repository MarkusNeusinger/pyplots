review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for accessibility and visual appeal
  - Clean combination of filled contours (geom_contourf) with white contour lines
    (geom_contour) for enhanced readability
  - Proper ggplot2-style grammar implementation with clean, readable code structure
  - Text sizing is well-calibrated for the output resolution
  - Mathematical demonstration effectively shows contour concept with two Gaussian
    peaks
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context-specific labeling (e.g., for a
    domain application)
  - The data shows a simple two-peak scenario; more complex features like saddle points
    could better demonstrate contour capabilities
  - Grid lines are absent due to theme_minimal; subtle grid could aid value estimation
