review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world example of diminishing returns in advertising economics
  - R² value and polynomial equation prominently displayed with clean annotation styling
  - Professional color scheme with good contrast between scatter points and regression
    curve
  - Proper use of plotly_white template for clean, publication-quality appearance
  - Outputs both static PNG and interactive HTML for maximum utility
  - All text elements are appropriately sized and readable
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size (14) is slightly small for 80 data points - could be increased to
    18-20 for better visibility
  - Does not use plotly native trendline functionality (px.scatter with trendline
    parameter)
  - No confidence band around the regression curve (optional per spec but would enhance
    visualization)
