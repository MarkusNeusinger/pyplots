review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_ribbon + geom_line combination
  - Heteroscedastic uncertainty (band widens over time) is a realistic forecasting
    pattern
  - Clean, minimal theme with well-tuned text sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper 95% CI calculation using 1.96 standard errors
  - Title correctly follows the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (days)" or "Predicted Value (units)")
  - Data could show both narrowing and widening uncertainty regions for better feature
    coverage
