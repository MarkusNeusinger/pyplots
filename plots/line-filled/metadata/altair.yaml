review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair gradient feature for the fill, creating a visually appealing
    fade effect
  - Line property within mark_area ensures the line is visible on top of the fill
  - Realistic website traffic data with growth trend and weekly cyclical patterns
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following library conventions
  - Proper font sizes for high-resolution output (scale_factor=3.0)
  - Tooltips included for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Daily Visitors (count)" or "Day of Month (day)")
  - The gradient direction could potentially be inverted (darker at line, lighter
    toward baseline) to better emphasize the data
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart showing "Daily Visitors"
    (y-axis, ranging from 0 to 9,000) over "Day of Month" (x-axis, days 1-30). The
    title "line-filled · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. A blue line
    (#306998) traces the daily visitor data, which shows an overall upward trend with
    weekly cyclical patterns. The area beneath the line is filled with a gradient
    from semi-transparent blue at the bottom to lighter blue near the line. The y-axis
    starts at 0 (proper baseline), and the data shows realistic website traffic ranging
    from approximately 4,600 to 8,700 visitors. The grid is subtle with dashed lines
    at approximately 0.3 opacity.
