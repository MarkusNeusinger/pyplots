review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waterfall chart using Altair layered approach with
    separate charts for bars, labels, and connectors
  - Clean color scheme using Python Blue for totals, green for gains, red for losses
    - visually intuitive
  - Well-formatted value labels showing both change values (+$XX/-$XX) and totals
    ($XX)
  - Proper use of y/y2 encoding for floating bars - idiomatic Altair approach
  - Dashed connector lines effectively show the cumulative flow between categories
  weaknesses:
  - Revenue bar shows "+$500" which implies an increase, but as a starting total it
    should show "$500" without the plus sign
  - No legend explaining the color scheme (blue=total, green=positive, red=negative)
  - Could benefit from interactive tooltips showing additional context
