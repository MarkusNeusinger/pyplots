review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using purple/yellow/blue instead of red/yellow/green
  - Clean implementation of Highcharts native gauge chart with proper pane configuration
  - Value display (72) is prominent and clearly readable at 64px
  - Three-zone color bands correctly implemented at specified thresholds
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific dial and pivot styling options
  - Proper 4800x2700 canvas sizing with appropriate font scaling
  weaknesses:
  - Tick labels on outer edge could be slightly larger (28px may be small for 4800px
    canvas)
  - Title format uses middle dot separators correctly but position could be higher
    for better spacing
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart with a dark blue
    needle pointing to the value 72. The gauge spans from 0 to 100 with tick marks
    and numeric labels at every 2 units. The title "gauge-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text. Three color zones are visible: purple (0-30)
    on the left for the low zone, golden/yellow (30-70) in the middle zone, and dark
    blue (70-100) on the right for the high zone. The value "72" is prominently displayed
    as a large bold number below the gauge center. The axis label "Performance (%)"
    appears in the center of the gauge. The background is white with subtle gradient
    effects on the gauge dial frame.'
  verdict: APPROVED
