review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with highly readable labels
  - Clean horizontal bar chart with proper descending sort (largest at bottom for
    visual hierarchy)
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: borderRadius on bars, inline dataLabels,
    subtitle'
  - Realistic business scenario with appropriate sales figures
  - Proper Selenium export with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - The y-axis value axis has no visible tick marks or gridlines in the rendered output,
    making it harder to estimate intermediate values
  - Data labels show K suffix but the axis title says thousands USD - minor redundancy
    in unit notation
