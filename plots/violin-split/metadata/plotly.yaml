review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native split violin capability with side="negative"/"positive"
  - Clean, professional color scheme with Python-themed blue and yellow
  - Mean lines provide useful statistical reference within each distribution
  - 'Good data storytelling: training program effectiveness clearly visible across
    all departments'
  - Proper output of both PNG and interactive HTML formats
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (alpha 0.1 is quite faint)
  - Distribution shapes are all unimodal normal; could benefit from more variety to
    showcase violin plot capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot shows a split violin chart with four departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Operations) on the x-axis and Performance Score (0-100 points)
    on the y-axis. Each violin is split into two halves: blue ("Before Training")
    on the left and yellow/gold ("After Training") on the right. The violins clearly
    show distribution shapes with dashed mean lines visible in each half. The title
    "violin-split · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top, with a horizontal
    legend below it showing the two periods. The background is white with subtle horizontal
    grid lines. All four departments show the "After Training" distributions shifted
    higher than "Before Training", demonstrating the training program''s effectiveness.'
