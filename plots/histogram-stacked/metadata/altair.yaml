review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent declarative encoding with proper use of Altair grammar (alt.X with bin,
    alt.Y with stack="zero", alt.Color with custom scale)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with good data generation
  - Proper font sizing throughout (title 28pt, axis titles 22pt, labels 18pt, legend
    16-18pt)
  - Good color palette choice (blue, yellow, orange) that avoids colorblind issues
  - White stroke between bar segments (strokeWidth=0.5) enhances visual separation
  - Appropriate use of scale_factor=3.0 for high-resolution output
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend styling could be more polished (title and label fonts could be slightly
    larger for better visual hierarchy)
  - Could add tooltips for interactive exploration showing exact counts per bin
  - The order parameter could be more intentionally designed to show a specific visual
    story (e.g., ordering by mean score)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked histogram showing test score distributions
    for three study methods. The X-axis shows "Test Score (points)" ranging from 40
    to 100, and the Y-axis shows "Number of Students" ranging from 0 to 80. Three
    groups are stacked: Traditional Study (blue, #306998), Active Recall (yellow,
    #FFD43B), and Passive Reading (orange, #E67E22). The stacking clearly shows individual
    group contributions with total bar heights representing combined frequencies.
    The title "histogram-stacked · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend
    on the right identifies each study method. The grid uses subtle dashed lines with
    low opacity.'

        comment: Good use of declarative encoding with alt.X, alt.Y, alt.Color, binning,
          and stack configuration, but could leverage more Altair-specific features
          like tooltips or selection
  verdict: APPROVED
