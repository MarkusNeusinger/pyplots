review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_segment to create horizontal bars sorted within each cluster,
    producing the characteristic silhouette shape
  - Clear cluster annotations with average scores positioned appropriately on the
    left side
  - Well-implemented dashed vertical line showing overall average silhouette score
    with label
  - Uses realistic Iris dataset which is a classic clustering example
  - Good color scheme with Python branding colors that are also colorblind-friendly
  - Proper ggplot2 grammar style with theme customization for clean appearance
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis extends to -0.3 but no negative silhouette values exist in the data, creating
    unnecessary whitespace
  - Legend is somewhat redundant since cluster labels are already annotated directly
    on the plot
  - The Iris dataset with 3 clusters produces all positive silhouette values; showing
    some negative values would better demonstrate the plot ability to highlight potential
    misclassifications
  image_description: 'The plot displays a silhouette coefficient visualization for
    3 clusters from the Iris dataset. The layout shows horizontal bars representing
    each sample''s silhouette score, grouped by cluster. Cluster 0 (blue, Python Blue
    #306998) is at the bottom with avg: 0.42, Cluster 1 (yellow/gold, Python Yellow
    #FFD43B) in the middle with avg: 0.80, and Cluster 2 (red, #DC2626) at the top
    with avg: 0.45. A vertical dashed black line indicates the overall average silhouette
    score (0.55) with "Avg: 0.55" label. Each cluster section is annotated with its
    name and average score on the left side. The x-axis shows "Silhouette Coefficient"
    ranging from -0.3 to 1.0, and the y-axis is labeled "Sample Index (sorted within
    cluster)" with tick marks hidden. A legend on the right shows cluster colors.
    The title reads "silhouette-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai".'
