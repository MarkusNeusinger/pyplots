review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of compass-style polar configuration (North at top, clockwise direction)
    making the wind data intuitive to interpret
  - Good color-coded time-of-day categorization with realistic clustering patterns
    showing prevailing wind directions
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate marker sizing and alpha for the data density (120 points)
  - Proper axis labeling with units and correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned too far from plot (bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1.0)) creating unnecessary
    whitespace; could be positioned closer or inside the plot
  - Could use matplotlib distinctive features more (e.g., colorbar for continuous
    third variable, custom tick formatters, or annotation capabilities)
