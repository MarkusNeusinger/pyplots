review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent compliance with specification including both gain curve and random baseline
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color scheme with blue-yellow contrast
  - Professional gradient area fill that enhances visual appeal
  - Appropriate subtitle providing context for the data scenario
  - Proper use of highcharts-core Python API with correct chart sizing
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend box overlaps the data visualization area; consider repositioning to top-left
    corner or outside the plot area
  - Could add annotations to highlight key insights (e.g., 50% of positives captured
    with 10% targeting)
