review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ggplot2 grammar with geom_ribbon for confidence band
  - Widening confidence interval effectively demonstrates forecast uncertainty growth
    over time
  - Good color scheme with contrasting yellow points on blue line
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate text sizing for high-resolution output (scale=3)
  - Realistic monthly sales forecast scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the central line and confidence band (spec explicitly
    requires this)
  - Grid lines render with dark outline on the confidence band edge rather than being
    purely subtle
  image_description: The plot displays a 24-month sales forecast with a confidence
    interval. It features a dark blue trend line connecting yellow circular data points,
    surrounded by a light blue semi-transparent ribbon showing the 95% confidence
    band. The confidence interval widens progressively over time (from ~±10 at month
    1 to ~±20 at month 24), effectively demonstrating forecast uncertainty growth.
    The y-axis shows "Sales (thousands)" ranging from ~50-125, and the x-axis shows
    "Month" from 0-24 with tick marks at intervals of 3. The title "line-confidence
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Subtle gray grid lines provide reference
    without overwhelming the data. The overall layout is clean with good use of the
    canvas space.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (geom_ribbon, geom_line, geom_point, theme_minimal),
          but could leverage more lets-plot specific features like tooltips or interactive
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
