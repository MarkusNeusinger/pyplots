review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn histplot with element=step and fill=False to create clean
    step histograms
  - Two overlapping distributions clearly demonstrate the comparison use case mentioned
    in spec
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with strong contrast between blue and yellow
  - All text sizes follow guidelines (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Realistic service response time scenario with appropriate exponential distributions
  weaknesses:
  - Data scenario is functional but generic - could use more specific service names
    or context
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is acceptable but could be slightly more subtle at 0.2
  image_description: The plot displays two step histograms showing response time distributions
    for two services. Service A is shown in blue (#306998) and Service B in yellow/gold
    (#FFD43B). Both histograms use step lines (outline only, no fill) as required
    by the spec. The x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to ~700ms, and
    the y-axis shows "Count" ranging from 0 to ~130. Service A (blue) has a tighter
    distribution peaking around 20-40ms with counts up to ~92, while Service B (yellow)
    has a wider distribution peaking around 40-60ms with counts up to ~130. Both show
    right-skewed (exponential) distributions. The title follows the correct format
    "histogram-stepwise · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A legend is placed in the upper right
    corner. A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background.

        comment: Uses seaborn's histplot with element='step' and fill=False - good
          use of seaborn's histogram API, though could use additional seaborn styling
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
