review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle grid and removed spines
  - Total value labels above each bar enhance readability and match spec recommendation
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual contrast
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible revenue values
  - White edge lines between segments improve segment distinction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement outside plot area works but creates slight visual separation
    from data
  - Data could show more diverse trends (e.g., one component declining while others
    grow) to better demonstrate stacked bar utility for composition analysis
  - Could leverage matplotlib hatching patterns to further distinguish segments for
    accessibility
