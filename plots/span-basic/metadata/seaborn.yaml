review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical and horizontal spans with meaningful
    context (recession period + target zone)
  - Data clearly shows the effect of the recession with visible dip during the highlighted
    period
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Good color choices that are colorblind accessible
  - Appropriate alpha values (0.25 and 0.2) keep underlying data visible
  weaknesses:
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib axvspan/axhspan rather than seaborn-specific features;
    could explore seaborn fill_between or other native approaches to demonstrate library
    strengths
