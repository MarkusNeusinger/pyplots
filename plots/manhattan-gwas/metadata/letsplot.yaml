review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Manhattan plot structure with proper cumulative genomic positions and
    chromosome labeling
  - Effective use of alternating blue/gray colors for chromosome distinction
  - Significant SNPs highlighted in red above genome-wide threshold line
  - Both genome-wide (dashed red) and suggestive (dotted gray) threshold lines included
  - Good data generation with realistic GWAS patterns including peaks on specific
    chromosomes
  weaknesses:
  - Chromosome labels on x-axis could be slightly larger for better readability at
    full resolution
