review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Colorblind-safe palette with four distinct, visually appealing colors
  - Proper 100% normalization with clear stacking from bottom to top
  - Clean KISS code structure with good commenting
  - Realistic market share scenario that fits the spec suggested applications
  - Both PNG and HTML output generated as expected for Bokeh
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactive tooltips (Bokeh key differentiator)
  - Data shows relatively gradual changes; more dramatic proportion shifts would better
    demonstrate the plot type purpose
  - Legend at 36pt appears slightly smaller than optimal compared to 48pt axis labels
