review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Marimekko chart logic with correct proportional widths
    and stacked heights
  - Value labels inside segments provide immediate readability of actual dollar amounts
  - Clean, professional appearance with white borders separating segments
  - Descriptive axis labels explain the dual-encoding concept (width = market size)
  - Well-structured hover templates with rich information (region, product, value,
    share)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle (alpha 0.1) making it difficult to read exact percentage
    values
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly; blue and teal may be hard to
    distinguish for some viewers
