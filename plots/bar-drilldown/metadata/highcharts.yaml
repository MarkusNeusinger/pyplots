review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Highcharts drilldown functionality with full 3-level
    hierarchy
  - Comprehensive data structure with 5 regions, 19 countries, and 52 cities
  - Clean, professional visual appearance with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution
    output
  - Colorblind-safe color palette
  - Proper breadcrumb navigation configuration for drill-up capability
  - Subtitle provides clear user guidance (Click columns to drill down)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw JavaScript configuration instead of highcharts-core Python API
  - X-axis title is generic Category instead of more descriptive Region
  - Minor height discrepancy in rendered output (2561 vs 2700 expected)
  image_description: The plot displays a column chart showing "Sales Revenue by Region"
    with 5 colorful vertical bars. The title "bar-drilldown · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top with a subtitle "Sales Revenue by Region —
    Click columns to drill down". The five regions shown are North America ($245M,
    blue), Europe ($198M, yellow), Asia Pacific ($176M, purple), Latin America ($87M,
    cyan), and Middle East ($54M, brown). Each bar has a data label showing the exact
    value. The Y-axis shows "Revenue ($M)" ranging from $0M to $260M. The X-axis displays
    region names in blue text. The chart uses a clean white background with subtle
    gray gridlines. Colors are distinct and colorblind-safe (no red-green conflicts).
