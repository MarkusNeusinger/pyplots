review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 3D bars using Mesh3d with proper vertex and face definitions
  - Good color scheme following Python-inspired palette that is colorblind-safe
  - Interactive hover templates with detailed information (product, quarter, sales
    value)
  - Dual output format (PNG + HTML) leveraging Plotly interactive capabilities
  - Realistic business scenario with seasonal sales patterns (Q4 holiday boost)
  - Semi-transparent bars (opacity=0.9) help with depth perception
  weaknesses:
  - Legend marker style (circular) does not match the bar chart style
  - Some minor occlusion of back rows inherent to 3D visualization could be mitigated
    with more transparency
