review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 180-degree rotational symmetry for black cells
  - Clean, professional appearance matching newspaper-style crosswords
  - Proper algorithm for calculating clue numbers (starts across/down words)
  - Good use of seaborn heatmap with square cells and grid lines
  - Appropriate color scheme with blue accents
  weaknesses:
  - Cell numbers could be slightly larger for better legibility at smaller sizes
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib ax.text() for annotations rather than seaborn-specific
    features
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with white entry
    cells and black blocking cells. The grid follows traditional 180-degree rotational
    symmetry with black cells distributed appropriately. Clue numbers (1-79) are positioned
    in the top-left corner of cells that start across or down words, rendered in a
    blue color (#306998). The grid lines are blue with a thicker blue border around
    the entire puzzle. The title "crossword-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in a bold font. The overall layout is clean, monochrome (white, black,
    and blue), and resembles a traditional newspaper crossword puzzle.

        comment: Uses sns.heatmap() effectively with square=True and linewidths, sns.set_style(),
          sns.color_palette(), but relies heavily on matplotlib for annotations
