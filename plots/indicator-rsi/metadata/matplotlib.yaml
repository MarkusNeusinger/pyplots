review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required RSI chart features (shaded zones,
    threshold lines, centerline, 14-period notation)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles with proper RSI calculation
  - Professional visual appearance with appropriate colors and clear visual hierarchy
  - Correct title format and well-organized legend
  - Proper use of fill_between for shaded zones creates clear visual distinction
  weaknesses:
  - RSI values never enter overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) zones, limiting demonstration
    of the indicator's key analytical purpose
  - Legend position in upper left slightly overlaps the RSI line at the chart start
  image_description: 'The plot displays an RSI (Relative Strength Index) technical
    indicator chart spanning from January 15, 2024 to late April 2024. The RSI line
    is rendered in dark blue with linewidth 3, showing values oscillating between
    approximately 28 and 67 throughout the period. The Y-axis is fixed from 0 to 100
    as required. The overbought zone (70-100) is shaded in light red/pink with a dashed
    red horizontal line at 70. The oversold zone (0-30) is shaded in light green with
    a dashed green horizontal line at 30. A dotted gray centerline appears at 50.
    Text annotations "Overbought (70)" in red and "Oversold (30)" in green are positioned
    on the right side. The legend in the upper left shows three entries: overbought
    zone, oversold zone, and RSI (14-period). The title correctly follows the format
    "indicator-rsi · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". A subtle gray dashed grid is visible
    behind the data.'
