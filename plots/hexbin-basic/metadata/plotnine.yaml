review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world data context with seismic events and realistic geographic
    coordinates
  - Complete spec compliance with color bar, viridis colormap, gridsize parameter,
    and proper title format
  - Good visual clarity with white hexagon edge highlighting and viridis color mapping
  - Clean plotnine grammar of graphics composition in the plotting layer
  weaknesses:
  - Design stays at library defaults — viridis + theme_minimal is standard, needs
    more distinctive aesthetic
  - Manual hexagonal binning is ~50 lines of complex geometry code that could be simplified
  - No distinctive plotnine features leveraged beyond basic geom_polygon
  - Title font size 22pt is slightly below the recommended 24pt threshold
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning density map of seismic
    event data plotted on geographic coordinates. Hexagons are colored using the viridis
    colormap, ranging from dark purple (low counts ~5) to bright yellow (high counts
    ~55). Two prominent high-density clusters are visible: one around longitude 35.5°E
    / latitude 37°N (primary fault zone, bright green/yellow) and another around longitude
    37.5°E / latitude 38.5°N (aftershock region, green/yellow). A smaller medium-density
    cluster appears near 33.5°E / 36.5°N. Diffuse low-density hexagons (dark purple)
    fill the surrounding area. White edges separate individual hexagons. The title
    reads "Seismic Event Density · hexbin-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". X-axis labeled
    "Longitude (°E)", Y-axis "Latitude (°N)". A colorbar legend on the right shows
    "Event Count" ranging from ~5 to ~55. Layout is 16:9 with theme_minimal styling.'
