review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features implemented (formulas in legend,
    annotation at p=0.5, edge case handling, grid)
  - Mathematically correct data with proper handling of log2(0) edge cases using np.errstate
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual contrast between the two curves
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis maximum of 1.05 with a visible tick at 1.2 creates unnecessary empty space
    above the data; consider setting max to 1.05 or removing the 1.2 tick
  - 'Design could be elevated with additional visual refinement: consider removing
    or further softening axis lines, or adding a filled area between the two curves
    to highlight their difference'
  - The annotation at p=0.5 only labels the entropy maximum; a second annotation or
    visual cue showing the Gini maximum at 0.5 would better tell the story of how
    these measures differ
  - LineSeries imported from highcharts_core.options.series.area instead of highcharts_core.options.series.line
    — functionally identical but semantically incorrect
  image_description: The plot displays two smooth curves on a white background comparing
    decision tree splitting criteria. A blue line represents Gini Impurity (2p(1-p)),
    peaking at approximately 0.5 at p=0.5. An orange line represents Entropy (-p log2p
    - (1-p) log2(1-p)), peaking at 1.0 at p=0.5. Both curves are symmetric and start/end
    at 0 for p=0 and p=1. The title reads "line-impurity-comparison · highcharts ·
    pyplots.ai" in bold, with a gray subtitle "Gini Impurity vs Entropy as Decision
    Tree Splitting Criteria." An annotation callout box labeled "Maximum impurity
    at p = 0.5" appears near the entropy peak. The legend in the upper-right shows
    both series with their mathematical formulas. X-axis is labeled "Probability (p)"
    with ticks from 0 to 1 at 0.1 intervals. Y-axis is labeled "Impurity Measure"
    with ticks from 0 to 1.2. Light grid lines provide readability. Lines are thick
    and clearly distinguishable.
