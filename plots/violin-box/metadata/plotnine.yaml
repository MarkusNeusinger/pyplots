  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing four distinct distribution types (normal, right-skewed
    with outliers, bimodal, uniform)
  - Clean layering of geom_violin and geom_boxplot demonstrating plotnine grammar
    of graphics
  - Good color palette with Python-themed colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Perfect title format and professional appearance
  - Outliers visible in Product B demonstrating complete statistical representation
  weaknesses:
  - Does not showcase plotnine-specific features beyond basic geoms (could use faceting,
    stat_summary, or position adjustments)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Score (points) or Score (0-100))
  image_description: The plot displays a violin plot with embedded box plots for four
    product categories (A, B, C, D). Colors used are Python Blue (#306998) for Product
    A, Yellow (#FFD43B) for Product B, Light Blue (#6A9BC9) for Product C, and Muted
    Gold (#D4A84B) for Product D. Each violin shows the distribution shape with white
    box plots centered inside showing median (horizontal line), quartiles (box), and
    whiskers. Product B shows outlier points above the upper whisker. The title "violin-box
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is at the top, x-axis is labeled "Product Category",
    and y-axis is labeled "Customer Satisfaction Score" with values ranging from ~30
    to ~85. The plot has a minimal theme with subtle grid lines.
