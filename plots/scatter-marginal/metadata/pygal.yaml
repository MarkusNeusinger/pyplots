review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using pygal chart compositing with PIL to achieve marginal distributions
    (pygal does not natively support this)
  - Clean visual design with subtle colors for marginals that do not distract from
    main scatter
  - Helpful statistics summary box showing sample size, correlation, and means
  - Good use of transparency (alpha 0.65) for scatter points to show density
  - Proper title format and professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Marginal histogram bins do not perfectly align with scatter plot axis ranges (visual
    alignment gap between charts)
  - Axis labels in the final image show X Value/Y Value rather than the intended Measurement
    A/B (units)
  - Right marginal histogram appears slightly disconnected from the main scatter plot
    area
