review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of lollipop chart using Altair layered approach (mark_rule
    for stems + mark_circle for dots)
  - Proper sorting by value for optimal readability
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes (title 28pt, labels 16-20pt)
  - Rotated x-axis labels (-45°) prevent overlap with 10 categories
  - Tooltips with currency formatting enhance usability
  - Realistic product sales data scenario
  - Subtle grid styling (opacity 0.3) does not distract from data
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear only on y-axis; adding subtle vertical grid lines could improve
    category-value alignment reading
  - Layout could utilize more canvas space (plot area is somewhat compact relative
    to total canvas)
