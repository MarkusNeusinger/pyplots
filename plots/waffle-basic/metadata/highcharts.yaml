review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation using scatter plot with square markers to create waffle
    grid effect
  - Perfect colorblind-safe palette with Python blue and complementary colors
  - Clean white borders between squares enhance visual separation
  - Legend includes percentages making data immediately interpretable
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Grid fills logically from bottom to top
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Category names are generic (Product A/B/C/D) rather than a realistic scenario
    like budget allocation or survey responses
