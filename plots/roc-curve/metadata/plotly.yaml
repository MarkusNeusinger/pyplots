review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)
    that are colorblind-safe'
  - Proper use of plotly scaleanchor and scaleratio for equal aspect ratio as recommended
    in spec
  - AUC values displayed in legend following spec requirements
  - Clean fill effect under the primary ROC curve adds visual appeal
  - Interactive HTML output generated alongside PNG, leveraging plotly interactivity
    strength
  - Well-configured legend with background and border for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions (calculate_roc, calculate_auc) instead of inline
    computation - violates KISS principle requiring no functions/classes
  - Legend position overlaps slightly with the plot area; could be positioned outside
    or with more careful placement
  image_description: The plot displays two ROC curves on a white background with subtle
    gray gridlines. The blue curve (Logistic Regression, AUC = 0.97) shows excellent
    classifier performance, hugging the top-left corner with a light blue shaded area
    underneath. The yellow curve (Decision Tree, AUC = 0.74) shows moderate performance,
    positioned between the blue curve and the diagonal. A dashed gray diagonal line
    represents the random classifier baseline (y=x). The title "roc-curve · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray text. Axes are labeled "False
    Positive Rate" (x-axis) and "True Positive Rate" (y-axis), both ranging 0-1 with
    0.2 tick intervals. The legend is positioned in the bottom-right with a white
    background and subtle border, showing all three elements with their labels and
    AUC scores.
