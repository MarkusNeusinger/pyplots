review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization following ggplot2 grammar of graphics
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Data effectively demonstrates Q-Q diagnostic capability with intentional right-tail
    deviation
  - Yellow reference line provides clear visual contrast against blue points
  - Proper standardization of sample quantiles using scipy.stats
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use plotnine built-in stat_qq or stat_qq_line for more idiomatic implementation
  - Axis labels could include context (e.g., Standard Normal in theoretical quantile
    label)
