review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Chernoff faces using lets-plot grammar of graphics
    approach
  - Clear visual distinction between species through face colors and facial feature
    variations
  - Well-organized 3×4 grid layout with proper spacing
  - Good use of geom_polygon for face outlines and eyes, geom_path for mouth and eyebrows
  - Real Iris dataset provides meaningful multivariate data demonstration
  - Proper normalization of data to 0-1 range as specified
  - 'Facial features effectively encode data: face width (sepal length), eye size
    (sepal width), mouth curvature (petal length), eyebrow slant (petal width)'
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function (create_face) which violates the KISS structure requirement
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (single word)
  - Legend is somewhat small and isolated on the right side
  - Nose does not vary based on any data variable (static for all faces)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 12 Chernoff faces arranged in a 3×4 grid layout.
    Each row represents a different iris species: Setosa (top row, blue faces), Versicolor
    (middle row, yellow faces), and Virginica (bottom row, red/pink faces). Each face
    has distinct facial features including eyes with pupils, eyebrows, a nose, and
    a mouth. The faces show variation in face width, eye size, mouth curvature (happy/sad),
    and eyebrow slant across different samples. Setosa faces appear "happier" with
    upward-curved mouths, while Virginica faces appear "sadder" with downward-curved
    mouths. Each face is labeled with its species name below. A legend on the right
    shows the three species colors. The title reads "Iris Species Comparison · chernoff-basic
    · lets-plot · pyplots.ai".'
