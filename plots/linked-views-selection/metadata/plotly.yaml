review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clean layout and consistent color scheme across all
    three views
  - 'Good use of Plotly features: legendgroup, hover templates, subplot spanning,
    annotation for instructions'
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Realistic Iris-like data with clear cluster separation that demonstrates the concept
    well
  - Interactive features documented with instruction annotation
  weaknesses:
  - The spec requires selection in any view to highlight corresponding points in all
    other views - this is NOT fully implemented. The current implementation only has
    dragmode=select on scatter but NO callback/mechanism to highlight corresponding
    data in histogram and bar chart. Legend clicking hides entire traces rather than
    highlighting selected subsets.
  - True linked brushing in Plotly requires either Dash callbacks or custom JavaScript
    - the static HTML export cannot provide this functionality without additional
    infrastructure.
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a multi-panel visualization with three coordinated views using Iris flower dataset styling:

    Top panel (spanning full width): A scatter plot showing Sepal Length (cm) vs Sepal Width (cm) with 150 data points colored by species: Setosa (blue #306998), Versicolor (yellow #FFD43B), and Virginica (red #E53935). Points have white outlines and ~80% opacity. The three species form distinct but overlapping clusters.

    Bottom-left panel: An overlaid histogram showing Petal Length (cm) distribution by species, with the same color scheme. Setosa clusters around 1-2 cm, Versicolor around 4-5 cm, and Virginica around 5-6 cm.

    Bottom-right panel: A bar chart showing species count, with each species having exactly 50 samples, displayed using the same colors.

    The title "linked-views-selection · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. A horizontal legend shows the three species at the top below the title. An instruction annotation at the bottom reads "Click legend items to toggle visibility | Use box/lasso select to highlight points". White/clean template with subtle grid lines.
