review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic context using Pacific Ring of Fire seismic activity scenario
  - Clear legend with 6 well-defined activity level categories
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of sequential red color palette showing intensity gradients
  - Proper acknowledgment in code comments that pygal cannot do native animation
  weaknesses:
  - Static snapshot only - spec calls for animated map with play/pause controls and
    time slider; should implement small multiples grid showing key time snapshots
    as spec suggests for libraries without animation support
  - Contains function definition (bin_activity) violating KISS structure principle
    - should inline the binning logic
  - Uses country-level choropleth instead of point data as specified (lat/lon coordinates)
  - Some small countries are difficult to see clearly at the current scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map showing seismic activity at time
    T6: +72h (72 hours after initial event). The map uses pygal_maps_world to render
    countries with a sequential red color palette indicating seismic intensity levels.
    Highlighted countries include: Mexico (light pink - Low), Chile and Peru (darker
    red - High/Severe), Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan (various shades of
    red), Japan, South Korea (lighter pink - diminishing activity), Australia and
    New Zealand (medium pink - Moderate/High). The legend at the bottom shows 6 categories
    from "Minimal (<20)" to "Extreme (80+)" using a red gradient from light to dark.
    The title follows the correct format "Seismic Activity (T6: +72h) · map-animated-temporal
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". All other countries remain white/unfilled. This represents
    a static snapshot of the final time frame in the seismic wave propagation simulation.'
