review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with European weather stations showing a coherent
    warming pattern spreading from south to north
  - Clean implementation of animated map using FuncAnimation with proper blit optimization
  - Simplified but effective Europe coastline using Polygon patches without external
    dependencies
  - Well-designed visual hierarchy with prominent timestamp display
  - Proper colorbar with labeled units for temperature anomaly
  - Good marker styling with white edges and alpha for visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Grid/graticule lines are barely visible - could be slightly more prominent for
    geographic reference
  - No explicit interactive controls (play/pause, slider) - relies on default animation
    playback
  - Some markers could be slightly larger for optimal visibility at full resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a geographic map of Europe showing temperature
    anomaly data for December 2025. The background is a light blue color representing
    water/ocean, with simplified polygon shapes depicting European landmasses in a
    beige/tan color. 25 weather stations are plotted as colored circular markers across
    Europe, with colors ranging from dark red/maroon (high anomaly ~3.5°C) to lighter
    coral/salmon shades (lower anomaly ~0.5°C). A colorbar on the right shows the
    "Temperature Anomaly (°C)" scale from -1.0 to 3.5, using a blue-to-red diverging
    colormap (RdBu_r). The current time frame "December 2025" is prominently displayed
    in the lower right corner with a white background box. Axis labels show Longitude
    (°) on x-axis and Latitude (°) on y-axis. The title "map-animated-temporal · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Most markers show warm (red) anomalies, indicating
    the warming pattern described in the data generation logic.
