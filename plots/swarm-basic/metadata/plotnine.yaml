review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of clinical trial scenario with dose-response relationship that
    tells a compelling story
  - Median markers (diamond shapes) add statistical context as recommended in spec
  - Good jitter implementation that spreads points horizontally without vertical displacement
  - Proper categorical ordering maintained (Placebo → Low → Medium → High Dose)
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently visible but acceptable)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm-style visualization with four treatment
    groups (Placebo, Low Dose, Medium Dose, High Dose) on the x-axis and Biomarker
    Level (ng/mL) on the y-axis ranging from ~20 to ~90. Each group uses a distinct
    color: teal/green for Placebo, orange for Low Dose, purple/violet for Medium Dose,
    and pink/magenta for High Dose. Individual data points are jittered horizontally
    to show distribution. Dark blue diamond-shaped median markers are prominently
    displayed for each group. The title follows the correct format: ''swarm-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai''. The background uses a minimal theme with subtle grid
    lines. The plot clearly shows an upward trend in biomarker levels from Placebo
    through High Dose groups.'
