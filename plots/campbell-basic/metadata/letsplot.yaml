review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required Campbell Diagram elements (mode curves,
    EO lines, critical speed markers, highlight zones) are present and correctly implemented'
  - Strong colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between all four mode curves
  - Rich use of lets-plot tooltips with formatted speed/frequency values and intersection
    labels
  - Realistic rotordynamics data with physically plausible gyroscopic effects on mode
    frequencies
  - Clean font sizing with all text explicitly set to readable sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Layout wastes space on the right side near the legend; canvas utilization could
    be improved by adjusting legend placement or axis limits
  - Engine order lines are not included in the legend, missing the spec's request
    for a clean legend distinguishing natural frequency curves from engine order lines
  - 'Visual refinement could be improved: consider removing or minimizing axis spines,
    adding more whitespace, or using a cleaner background'
  - Data storytelling is limited — critical speed intersections could benefit from
    annotations or a subtitle explaining their engineering significance
  - Only 4 modes shown when spec suggests 4-5; adding a 5th mode would demonstrate
    fuller feature coverage
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Campbell Diagram with four natural frequency
    mode curves plotted against rotational speed (0–6,000 RPM) on the x-axis and frequency
    (0–115 Hz) on the y-axis. The mode curves are: 1st Bending (blue, ~25 Hz, rising
    slightly), 1st Torsional (orange, ~48 Hz, decreasing slightly), 2nd Bending (teal,
    ~72 Hz, rising), and Axial (purple, ~95 Hz, nearly flat with slight decrease).
    Three gray dashed diagonal engine order lines (1×, 2×, 3×) extend from the origin,
    with bold gray labels near their upper ends. Red diamond markers highlight critical
    speed intersections where EO lines cross mode curves. Subtle pink/red rectangular
    highlight zones surround each intersection point. The legend on the right shows
    "Mode Shape" with all four modes. The title "campbell-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered and bold at the top. The layout is clean with a light gray grid, white
    background, and good overall proportions.'
