review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the dumbbell chart with proper horizontal orientation
    as specified
  - Smart sorting by improvement magnitude reveals patterns effectively (Customer
    Support had biggest gain)
  - Clean, professional color scheme using Python brand colors (blue/yellow) that
    are colorblind-safe
  - 'Good use of Plotly features: custom hover templates, clean layout, interactive
    HTML export'
  - Well-proportioned marker size (18) and subtle connecting lines (width 2, gray)
    create clear visual hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label Satisfaction Score could include units like (%) or (out of 100) for
    clarity
  - All changes are positive; including one department with negative/minimal change
    would demonstrate fuller data range
  - Grid shows only vertical lines; adding horizontal gridlines at low alpha could
    aid reading values
