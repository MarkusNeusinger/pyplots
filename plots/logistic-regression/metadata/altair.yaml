review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the sigmoid curve with manual gradient descent fitting
  - Well-designed confidence interval band using mark_area
  - Appropriate jittering of data points for visibility
  - Clean Altair layer composition combining multiple visual elements
  - 'Good color choice (Python blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Tooltips included for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label could include units (e.g., Study Hours (hrs))
  - Some data points at boundary regions show unexpected class membership (pass at
    low hours, fail at high hours) which may confuse viewers
  - Grid opacity could be slightly more subtle (0.2 instead of 0.3)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a logistic regression visualization with the
    characteristic S-shaped sigmoid curve. The x-axis shows "Study Hours" ranging
    from 0 to 10.8, and the y-axis shows "Probability / Outcome" ranging from -0.10
    to 1.10. Data points are colored by class: blue circles for "Fail" (clustered
    near the bottom around y=0) and yellow circles for "Pass" (clustered near the
    top around y=1). The blue sigmoid curve shows the fitted logistic regression probability,
    surrounded by a light blue semi-transparent confidence interval band. A gray dashed
    horizontal line at p=0.5 indicates the decision threshold, with a "Decision Threshold
    (p=0.5)" label. The legend in the upper right shows "Exam Result" with Fail (blue)
    and Pass (yellow). The title reads "logistic-regression · altair · pyplots.ai".'
