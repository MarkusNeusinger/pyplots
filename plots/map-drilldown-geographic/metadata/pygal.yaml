review:
  strengths:
  - Well-structured hierarchical data covering 5 countries, 15 states, and 30+ cities
  - Excellent use of pygal World map and SVG capabilities
  - Comprehensive HTML interactive version with drill-down, breadcrumb navigation,
    and back button
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with distinct tiers
  - Clean visual presentation with proper title formatting
  - Good separation between static PNG overview and interactive HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - PNG is a static overview only; the actual drill-down interactivity requires HTML
    version
  - Two tiers (Germany/Brazil) share the same teal color making them visually identical
  - Legend text in PNG could be slightly larger for optimal readability
  - Bottom margin is quite large, reducing effective map area
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a world map (Mercator-style projection) with 5 countries highlighted in different colors representing sales tiers:
    - United States: Dark blue (#1B4F72), representing ">$1B" tier
    - Germany: Teal/green (#148F77), representing "$300-500M" tier
    - Japan: Orange (#E67E22), representing "$500M-1B" tier
    - Brazil: Teal/green (#148F77), representing "$300-500M" tier
    - Australia: Purple (#6C3483), representing "<$300M" tier

    The title "map-drilldown-geographic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. At the bottom, there is a subtitle "World > Click any country to drill down to states/provinces" serving as breadcrumb navigation guidance. Below that is a legend with 4 color-coded tiers arranged horizontally. All other countries are shown in light gray with borders. The overall layout is clean with the map taking up most of the canvas.
