review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (:N, :Q)
  - Clean, well-proportioned visualization with good color choices
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good font sizing throughout making all text highly legible
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity in HTML version
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided as required
  weaknesses:
  - HTML export menu (...) is subtle and may not be immediately discoverable to users
    unfamiliar with Vega-Lite/Altair
  - Could have added .interactive() for zoom/pan functionality to enhance the interactive
    experience
  - Product B data is noticeably derived from Product A (0.7 multiplier), making the
    relationship somewhat artificial
  image_description: The plot displays a dual-line chart showing monthly sales data
    for two products over a calendar year (January to December). Product A is rendered
    as a blue line (#306998) with circular point markers, showing values ranging from
    approximately 81 (January) to a peak of 163 (July) before declining to 87 (December).
    Product B is shown as a yellow/gold line (#FFD43B), following a similar seasonal
    pattern but at lower values, ranging from about 59 (January) to a peak of around
    110 (August). Both lines have prominent circular markers at each data point. The
    chart has a clean white background with subtle gray gridlines. The title "chart-export-menu
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. The y-axis is labeled "Sales
    (thousands)" and the x-axis is labeled "Month". A legend in the top-right corner
    identifies the two product series. The chart uses good proportions with the plot
    area filling most of the canvas.
