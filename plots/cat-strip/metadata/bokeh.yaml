review:
  strengths:

  - Well-implemented jitter using manual x-position offsets
  - Realistic business context with meaningful category differentiation
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool for interactivity (Bokeh key strength)
  - Vertical grid on categorical axis is less useful
