# indicator-sma: Simple Moving Average (SMA) Indicator Chart

## Description

A Simple Moving Average (SMA) chart displays price or value data with one or more SMA overlays, typically showing short, medium, and long-term periods (e.g., 20, 50, 200-day). Each SMA line smooths out price fluctuations by averaging the last N data points, revealing underlying trends at different time scales. This multi-period overlay is fundamental to technical analysis, helping traders identify trend direction, support/resistance levels, and potential crossover signals.

## Applications

- Identifying trend direction by comparing price position relative to 50-day and 200-day SMAs in stock analysis
- Detecting golden cross (50-day crosses above 200-day) and death cross signals in cryptocurrency trading
- Analyzing short-term momentum versus long-term trend using 20/50/200-day SMA combinations
- Smoothing noisy time series data to reveal underlying patterns in sensor or metrics monitoring

## Data

- `date` (datetime) - Trading date or timestamp for each period
- `close` (numeric) - Closing price or value for each period
- `sma_short` (numeric) - Short-term SMA (e.g., 20-period)
- `sma_medium` (numeric) - Medium-term SMA (e.g., 50-period)
- `sma_long` (numeric) - Long-term SMA (e.g., 200-period)
- Size: 250-500 periods to show meaningful long-term SMA behavior
- Example: Daily stock closing prices with 20, 50, and 200-day SMAs over one year of trading

## Notes

- Display the price/close line prominently, typically as a solid line or with subtle markers
- Each SMA should use a distinct color with consistent styling across all implementations
- Include a legend showing the period for each SMA (e.g., "SMA 20", "SMA 50", "SMA 200")
- Longer SMAs will have more initial null values due to the calculation window
- Standard periods are 20/50/200 for daily data, but other combinations like 10/20/50 are also common
- Grid lines on the y-axis improve price level readability
