review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative encoding with proper type annotations (T,
    Q, N)
  - Proper stack ordering using Order encoding to control layer sequence (largest
    at bottom)
  - Interactive tooltips with formatted values enhance usability
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for all four categories
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs leverage Altair dual static/interactive capability
  - Clean long-form data structure idiomatic to Altair/Vega-Lite
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols lack visible stroke, making color patches slightly harder to distinguish
    at a glance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing monthly revenue
    by product category over two years (Jan 2023 - Nov 2024). Four distinct areas
    are stacked from bottom to top: Software (Python blue #306998), Hardware (Python
    yellow #FFD43B), Services (teal #5D9B9B), and Support (mauve #A85C5C). The title
    "area-stacked · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The X-axis shows
    "Month" with rotated date labels (e.g., "Jan 2023", "Mar 2023"), and the Y-axis
    shows "Revenue ($ thousands)" ranging from 0 to ~300. A legend titled "Product
    Category" appears on the right side. The chart has subtle dashed grid lines and
    shows realistic revenue trends with variation over time.'
