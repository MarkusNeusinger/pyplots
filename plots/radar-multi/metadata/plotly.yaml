review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Scatterpolar trace with proper polygon closing technique
  - Clean, professional color scheme using Python brand colors (blue, yellow) plus
    complementary teal
  - 'All spec requirements met: transparency (0.25 alpha), gridlines at proper intervals,
    legend, distinct colors'
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with clear data organization
  - Proper output sizing (1600x900 with scale=3 = 4800x2700 px)
  - Good choice of product comparison scenario that makes the data meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Legend margin (r=200) creates excessive whitespace on the right side of the plot
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover templates
    to show exact values
