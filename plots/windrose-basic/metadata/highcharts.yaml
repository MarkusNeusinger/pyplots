review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent wind rose visualization with clear polar stacked bar representation
  - Color progression from cool to warm is intuitive and colorblind-safe
  - Data generation is realistic with prevailing westerly pattern and Weibull speed
    distribution
  - All 8 compass directions are clearly labeled with appropriate frequency percentages
  - Title format follows spec exactly
  weaknesses:
  - The Frequency (%) radial axis title overlaps with percentage labels - consider
    removing or repositioning
  - Uses manual JSON config instead of highcharts-core Python library (acceptable
    but less idiomatic)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar wind rose chart with 8 compass direction
    sectors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). The chart uses stacked bars radiating from
    the center, with 5 color-coded speed ranges: dark blue (0-3 m/s), teal (3-6 m/s),
    yellow (6-9 m/s), orange (9-12 m/s), and red (>12 m/s). The dominant wind directions
    are clearly W, SW, and S, showing a prevailing westerly pattern. The title "windrose-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is at the top with subtitle "Annual Wind Pattern Distribution".
    A legend on the right shows "Wind Speed" categories. Radial axis shows frequency
    percentages from 0% to 24%. Grid lines are subtle gray circles.'
