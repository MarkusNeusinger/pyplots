review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual execution of Sudoku grid with clear visual hierarchy between
    3x3 boxes and individual cells
  - Perfect text legibility with appropriately sized bold numbers
  - Clean monochrome design ideal for printing as specified
  - Good canvas utilization with well-balanced layout
  - Outputs both SVG and PNG formats leveraging pygal native SVG capabilities
  - Valid, recognizable Sudoku puzzle with varied difficulty regions
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a custom class (SudokuGrid) instead of simple procedural code, violating
    the KISS principle for plot implementations
  - sys.path manipulation is unnecessary complexity that could be avoided
