review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Strong design sophistication with refined legend (shadow, border, padding), annotation
    boxes, and polished tooltip styling
  - Complete spec compliance including formulas in legend, annotation at p=0.5, and
    proper edge case handling at p=0 and p=1
  - 'Good use of distinctive Highcharts features: SplineSeries, AreaRangeSeries for
    fill between curves, annotations API, plotLines with labels'
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate complexity
  weaknesses:
  - The area range fill between the two curves is extremely subtle (opacity 0.08)
    — making it slightly more visible would better highlight the difference region
  - The plotLines reference labels (Gini max = 0.5, Entropy max = 1.0) at the far
    right edge are somewhat small compared to other text and could be more prominent
  - Data storytelling could be enhanced — the plot does not communicate why the similarity
    between Gini and entropy matters in practice
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth spline curves on a light gray (#fafafa)
    background. A blue (Python Blue #306998) curve represents Gini Impurity: 2p(1-p),
    rising from (0,0) to a peak of 0.5 at p=0.5, then descending back to (1,0). An
    orange (#E8793A) curve represents Entropy: -p log2p - (1-p) log2(1-p), following
    a similar arc but peaking at 1.0 at p=0.5. A very subtle shaded area fills the
    region between the two curves. Horizontal dashed reference lines are drawn at
    y=0.5 (labeled "Gini max = 0.5" in blue on the right) and y=1.0 (labeled "Entropy
    max = 1.0" in orange on the right). An annotation box near p=0.5 reads "Both peak
    at p = 0.5 / Entropy = 1.0 | Gini = 0.5". The legend in the top-right corner lists
    both series with their mathematical formulas. Title reads "line-impurity-comparison
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Gini Impurity vs Entropy as Decision
    Tree Splitting Criteria". X-axis labeled "Probability (p)" from 0 to 1, Y-axis
    labeled "Impurity Measure" from 0 to ~1.1. Dotted grid lines provide readability.'
