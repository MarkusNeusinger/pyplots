review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing throughout with 72px title, 48px axis titles, and 36px labels
    ensuring all text is highly legible
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple, cyan) with distinct marker shapes
    (circle, square, triangle, diamond) for double encoding
  - Clean, realistic data scenario with 4 product categories showing different seasonal
    patterns
  - Proper Highcharts implementation with correct container setup, series configuration,
    and Selenium-based PNG export
  - Good use of subtitle for additional context about the data
  weaknesses:
  - LineSeries imported from wrong module (highcharts_core.options.series.area instead
    of highcharts_core.options.series.line) - works but incorrect
  - Legend text could be larger relative to the plot scale for better visibility
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like tooltips configuration or
    animation settings in the HTML output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-line chart with 4 distinct product
    category series tracked over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The title "line-multi · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle "Monthly
    Sales by Product Category (thousands USD)" below it. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales
    (thousands USD)" and ranges from 0 to 300. The X-axis shows month abbreviations.
    Four lines are plotted: Electronics (blue with circle markers, showing strong
    growth to 280), Clothing (yellow with square markers, showing seasonal pattern),
    Home & Garden (purple with triangle markers, peaking mid-year), and Sports Equipment
    (cyan/teal with diamond markers, showing a summer peak). A legend in the upper
    right identifies each series with matching colors and marker shapes. The lines
    are thick (6px) with visible markers at data points. The background is white with
    subtle gray gridlines.'
