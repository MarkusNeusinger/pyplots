review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly add_hline with annotation positioning for the reference
    lines
  - Interactive hover template provides detailed information for each observation
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color contrast between data points and reference
    lines
  - Proper statistical calculations for Bland-Altman analysis (mean ± 1.96 SD)
  - Realistic medical measurement context that aligns perfectly with spec blood pressure
    example
  weaknesses:
  - Data could include a few clear outliers beyond the limits of agreement to demonstrate
    how such cases appear on the plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement plot on a white background
    with the title "bland-altman-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" at the top center. The
    x-axis shows "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" ranging from approximately 85 to 155,
    and the y-axis shows "Difference (Method 1 − Method 2) (mmHg)" ranging from -15
    to about 8. There are 80 blue circular markers (color #306998) with white edges
    and moderate transparency scattered across the plot. A solid blue horizontal line
    indicates the mean difference at -2.44, and two dashed gold/yellow horizontal
    lines mark the limits of agreement at +1.96 SD (6.55) and -1.96 SD (-11.44). Annotations
    on the right side clearly label these reference lines with their values. The grid
    is subtle with light gray lines.'
