review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent adherence to sparkline minimalist design (no axes, labels, or gridlines)
  - Perfect aspect ratio (6:1) within the spec recommended 4:1 to 8:1 range
  - 'All optional features implemented: min/max highlights, first/last points, area
    fill'
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Correct title format and proper output files (PNG and HTML)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive lets-plot features (e.g., tooltips in HTML version)
  - Data trend could be more dramatic to better showcase sparkline utility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a minimal sparkline showing stock price trends
    over 60 trading days. It features a thin blue line (#306998) with a subtle light
    blue area fill beneath it. Four highlight points are visible: a green dot marking
    the maximum value (positioned early in the series), a red dot marking the minimum
    (towards the right side), and two smaller yellow dots marking the first and last
    data points. The title "sparkline-basic · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top in a readable font. The chart uses a ~6:1 aspect ratio (4800x800px)
    with no axes, gridlines, or labels - adhering to the sparkline minimalist philosophy.
    The data shows an overall slightly positive trend with volatility.'
