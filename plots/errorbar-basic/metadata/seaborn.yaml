review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean visual design with prominent error bar caps (capsize=8, capthick=2.5)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic experimental data scenario with treatment groups
  - Uses modern seaborn API correctly (hue with palette, legend=False)
  weaknesses:
  - Alternating blue/yellow colors have no semantic meaning - consider single color
    or meaningful grouping
  - Error bars added via matplotlib errorbar() instead of seaborn native errorbar
    parameter in barplot
  - Axis label uses generic units placeholder instead of specific measurement units
  image_description: The plot displays a bar chart showing 6 treatment groups (Control,
    Treatment A, B, C, D, E) on the x-axis with Response Value (units) on the y-axis
    ranging from 0 to approximately 75. Each bar has prominent black error bars with
    visible caps (capsize=8). The bars alternate between Python blue (#306998) and
    Python yellow (#FFD43B) colors. The title correctly shows "errorbar-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". Text is clearly legible with appropriate font sizes. The layout
    uses a white grid background with subtle dashed gridlines on the y-axis only.
