review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range selector buttons using geom_rect and geom_text
    layers
  - Clean visual hierarchy with highlighted active button
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics approach
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility
  - Helpful disclaimer annotation explaining static nature
  - Proper figure sizing and text scaling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid could be slightly more visible (alpha=0.3 is quite subtle)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a time series line chart showing stock price data from January 2023 to January 2025 (2 years). The main visual elements are:
    - Title: "line-range-buttons · plotnine · pyplots.ai" at the top center
    - Range selector buttons: Six buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, All) positioned at the top of the plot area, with "All" highlighted in blue (#306998) and the rest in light gray (#E8E8E8)
    - Line chart: A blue line (#306998) showing price fluctuations starting around $100, dipping to ~$80, rising to a peak of ~$155 in early 2024, then declining back to ~$105
    - Axes: Y-axis labeled "Price ($)" ranging from 60-150, X-axis labeled "Date" with 3-month intervals showing "Mon YYYY" format, rotated 45°
    - Grid: Subtle light gray gridlines
    - Note: Small gray text at bottom left stating "[Static visualization - buttons shown for demonstration]"
    - Layout: Clean white background, good use of space with buttons integrated above the chart area
