review:
  strengths:
  - Clean dual-pane layout with proper 75%/25% height ratio
  - Excellent color scheme using Python blue/yellow that is colorblind-safe
  - Volume bars correctly colored to match candlestick direction for visual consistency
  - Proper date formatting with business days and rotated labels
  - Good use of matplotlib subplots with shared x-axis
  weaknesses:
  - Missing crosshair/cursor spanning both panes as specified in requirements
  - Candlestick wicks are thin (linewidth=1.5) - could be slightly thicker for better
    visibility at scale
