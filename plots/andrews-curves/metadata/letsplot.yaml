review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation algorithm
  - Proper normalization of data using StandardScaler before transformation
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.4) for overlapping curves as recommended in
    spec
  - Clear cluster separation visible between species
  - Proper use of π symbols in x-axis tick labels
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, readable code structure
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - No visible grid lines to aid visual reference (theme_minimal may have removed
    them, but subtle grid would help)
  - Missing explicit random seed (though data is deterministic from sklearn, good
    practice to include)
