review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all 4 standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted,
    dash-dot) using pygal stroke_dasharray
  - Clear, readable text with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  - Realistic temperature sensor data scenario with seasonal variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of custom Style for large canvas sizing
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper left could be moved to avoid any potential overlap with
    data
  - Color palette includes red-green combination; while line styles provide differentiation,
    a more colorblind-friendly palette would be better
  - Could showcase more pygal-specific features like tooltips or value labels
