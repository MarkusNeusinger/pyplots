review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of center annotation for total budget display
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with Python blue as primary
  - White borders between segments improve visual separation
  - Subtle pull effect adds visual interest without distraction
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning creates slight layout imbalance
  - Could leverage more Plotly interactivity features like custom hover templates
  image_description: The plot displays a donut chart with 6 budget allocation categories
    rendered as colored ring segments. The largest segment is Engineering (35%) in
    Python blue (#306998), followed by Marketing (20%) in yellow, Operations (15%)
    in teal, Sales (15%) in coral/salmon, R&D (10%) in green, and HR (5%) in orange.
    Each segment has a slight pull/explosion effect and white borders between segments.
    Labels with category names and percentages are positioned outside the ring. The
    center contains "Total $100M" in blue text. A vertical legend on the right lists
    all categories. The title "donut-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    center.

        comment: Uses go.Pie with hole parameter, add_annotation for center text,
          and HTML export for interactivity. Could have used more Plotly-specific
          features like hovertemplate customization.
  verdict: APPROVED
