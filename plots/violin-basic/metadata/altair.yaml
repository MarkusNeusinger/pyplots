quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of distribution shapes with the bimodal Sales distribution
    clearly visible
  - Proper implementation of quartile markers (IQR line) and median points inside
    violins
  - Good use of Altair declarative syntax with transform_density and layering
  - Realistic salary data scenario with meaningful variation between departments
  - Correct title format and well-sized text elements
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines on the plot to aid value reading
  - Color alternating pattern (2 colors for 4 categories) does not add meaningful
    category distinction
  - Could benefit from adding tooltips for interactivity
