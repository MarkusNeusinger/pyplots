review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent DFS maze generation algorithm that guarantees a single solution path
  - Clean black-and-white design optimized for printing with consistent wall thickness
  - Good use of square aspect ratio (4800x4800) appropriate for maze visualization
  - Start (S) and Goal (G) markers are clearly positioned and labeled
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output leveraging Bokeh dual export capability
  - Proper use of match_aspect=True to maintain square cells
  weaknesses:
  - Start and goal markers appear quite small in the generated image; could be more
    prominent for better visibility when printed
  - The markers (S and G) could benefit from being slightly larger or positioned with
    more visual emphasis
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 printable maze puzzle with black walls
    on a white background. The maze is square-shaped and fills most of the canvas.
    At the top-left corner, there is a blue circular marker with the letter "S" (start)
    in white text. At the bottom-right corner, there is a yellow circular marker with
    the letter "G" (goal) in dark gray text. The title "maze-printable · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center in gray text. The maze structure shows a complex pattern
    of passages generated using DFS algorithm, with consistent wall thickness throughout.
    The design is clean and print-friendly with high contrast.
