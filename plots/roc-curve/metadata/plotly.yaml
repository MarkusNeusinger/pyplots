review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)
    that are colorblind-safe'
  - Proper use of plotly scaleanchor and scaleratio for equal aspect ratio as recommended
    in spec
  - AUC values displayed in legend following spec requirements
  - Clean fill effect under the primary ROC curve adds visual appeal
  - Interactive HTML output generated alongside PNG, leveraging plotly interactivity
    strength
  - Well-configured legend with background and border for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions (calculate_roc, calculate_auc) instead of inline
    computation - violates KISS principle requiring no functions/classes
  - Legend position overlaps slightly with the plot area; could be positioned outside
    or with more careful placement
