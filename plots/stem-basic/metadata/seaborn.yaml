review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color contrast
  - Correct title format following the specification requirements
  - Well-chosen data example (damped sinusoidal impulse response) that demonstrates
    stem plot characteristics
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with fixed random seed
  - Good use of spine removal for cleaner aesthetics
  - Markers have clear edge colors making them visually distinct from stems
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn distinctive features beyond scatterplot; the implementation
    primarily uses matplotlib for the stem visualization
  image_description: The plot displays a stem plot showing a damped sinusoidal impulse
    response. It has 30 data points with yellow circular markers (with blue outlines)
    connected by blue vertical stems to a horizontal baseline at y=0. The x-axis is
    labeled "Sample Index (n)" ranging from 0 to 30, and the y-axis is labeled "Amplitude"
    ranging from approximately -1.0 to 1.8. The title reads "stem-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. The plot shows a characteristic damped oscillation
    pattern with high amplitude early samples that decay exponentially while oscillating.
    A subtle gray dashed grid is visible in the background. The top and right spines
    have been removed for a cleaner appearance.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot for markers which is appropriate, but the main
          visualization relies heavily on matplotlib's vlines and axhline. Seaborn
          doesn't have a native stem plot function, so this hybrid approach is acceptable
          but not showcasing seaborn's distinctive features.
  verdict: APPROVED
