review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data storytelling with the Top seller annotation providing contextual
    insight (17% ahead of #2) and the average reference line giving statistical context'
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for 4800x2700 output — perfectly
    readable
  - Clean, idiomatic Plotly code with good use of library-specific features (hovertemplate,
    texttemplate, add_hline with annotation)
  - Thoughtful visual hierarchy with subtle darker shade for top performer and minimal
    bar outlines
  - Dual output (PNG + interactive HTML) leverages Plotly interactive strengths
  weaknesses:
  - The Top seller annotation box overlaps/crowds the $45,200 value label on the Electronics
    bar, creating visual clutter at the most important data point
  - The color contrast between the highlighted top bar (#1A4971) and regular bars
    (#306998) is quite subtle — could be more visually distinct to reinforce the storytelling
  - The average line annotation is pushed to the far right margin — could be positioned
    more prominently

  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. Eight bars represent product sales by department,
    sorted in descending order from left to right: Electronics ($45,200), Clothing
    ($38,700), Home & Garden ($31,500), Sports ($27,800), Books ($24,300), Toys ($21,600),
    Automotive ($18,900), and Health ($15,400). Dollar-formatted value labels appear
    above each bar. The top-performing Electronics bar is rendered in a slightly darker
    navy blue (#1A4971) while the remaining bars use a medium blue (#306998). A "Top
    seller / 17% ahead of #2" annotation with an arrow points to the Electronics bar.
    A dotted horizontal reference line marks the average at $27,925 with a label on
    the far right. The background is white with very subtle horizontal gridlines.
    The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" and the y-axis "Sales ($)" with dollar-formatted
    tick marks. Overall layout is clean and well-proportioned.'
