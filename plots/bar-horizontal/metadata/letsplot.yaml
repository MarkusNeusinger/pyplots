review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with coord_flip for horizontal bars
  - Clean professional appearance with theme_minimal and customized theme elements
  - Real-world programming language survey data with realistic values
  - Proper sorting (ascending) so largest bars appear at top when displayed
  - Correct high-resolution export with scale=3 for 4800x2700 px output
  - Good use of pd.Categorical to preserve sort order
  weaknesses:
  - Grid customization could be slightly more refined with lower alpha for vertical
    grid lines
