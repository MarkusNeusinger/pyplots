review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate implementation with proper compass direction labels
    (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
  - Realistic wind data simulation using directional probability weighting and Weibull
    distribution for speeds
  - Clean, colorblind-accessible color scheme (Python Blue, Yellow, Purple)
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with coord_polar transformation
  - Square 1:1 aspect ratio is ideal for polar plots
  weaknesses:
  - Some data point overlap in the NW/SW high-density sectors - consider slightly
    smaller point size or lower alpha
  - Legend positioning creates slight layout asymmetry
