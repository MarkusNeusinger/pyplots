review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm
    with proper attractive/repulsive forces and cooling
  - Clear community structure visualization with three well-separated clusters
  - Good use of node size encoding to show degree (connection count)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with strong differentiation between Engineering (blue),
    Marketing (yellow), and Sales (coral)
  - Proper use of Altair layered composition to combine edges, nodes, and labels
  - Tooltips provide useful community and degree information on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Some Hub labels overlap in dense areas (particularly in the Engineering cluster)
  - Edge opacity is quite low (0.4) making some connections difficult to trace visually
  - Generates unnecessary plot.html file in addition to plot.png
