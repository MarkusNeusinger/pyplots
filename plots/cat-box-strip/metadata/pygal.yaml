review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using XY chart to achieve box plot with strip overlay
    (pygal.Box does not support strip overlay natively)
  - Well-designed color scheme with matching box and point colors for each category
  - Good use of custom Style for proper font sizing at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clear statistical visualization with median, quartiles, whiskers, and caps properly
    constructed
  - Jitter and transparency on strip points effectively reduce overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only shows on y-axis, no x-axis guides (minor visual consistency issue)
  - Some strip points in dense areas still overlap slightly despite jitter
