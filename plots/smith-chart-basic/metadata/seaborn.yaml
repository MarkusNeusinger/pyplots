review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Smith chart grid implementation with proper constant R circles and X
    arcs
  - Smart frequency label positioning with manual offsets prevents overlap
  - Complete feature set including VSWR circle and center marking
  - Professional color scheme with good accessibility
  - Title format exactly matches specification
  weaknesses:
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib for grid drawing; seaborn only used for final locus
    overlay
  - Canvas utilization could be improved (square 12x12 on 16:9 target)
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance visualization.
    The chart features a square 12x12 figure with proper aspect ratio. The outer boundary
    is a dark blue unit circle representing |Γ|=1 (total reflection). Multiple constant
    resistance circles (r=0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) are drawn in blue, centered along the
    horizontal real axis. Constant reactance arcs in gold/yellow (x=±0.2, ±0.5, ±1,
    ±2) curve from the right edge. A red impedance locus curve traces the frequency
    sweep from 1.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz, with five key frequency markers (1.0, 3.2, 4.8,
    3.6, 6.0 GHz) labeled in dark blue text. A dashed purple VSWR 3:1 circle (|Γ|=0.5)
    is included. The center point is marked with a green '+' symbol and labeled 'Z₀
    (50Ω)'. A legend in the upper left shows all four element types. Axes are labeled
    'Real(Γ)' and 'Imag(Γ)' with appropriate font sizes.
