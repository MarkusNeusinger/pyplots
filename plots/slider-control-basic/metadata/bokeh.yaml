review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of interactive slider control with CustomJS callback
    for client-side updates
  - Clean visual design with professional color scheme (Python blue/yellow)
  - Proper title format including dynamic year update in callback
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML outputs appropriately
  - Seasonal sales pattern adds realistic data variation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend area shows some visual artifacts/rendering issues on the right side
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance the interactive experience by showing exact
    values on hover
  - The interactive note annotation could be more visually integrated
  image_description: The plot displays a bar chart showing monthly sales data for
    2024. Blue vertical bars (#306998) represent sales values for each month (Jan-Dec)
    on the x-axis, with values ranging from approximately 70 to 140 thousand USD on
    the y-axis. A yellow/gold trend line (#FFD43B) with circular markers connects
    the tops of the bars, showing the overall trend. The title reads "Monthly Sales
    (2024) · slider-control-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top left. The y-axis
    is labeled "Sales (thousands USD)" and the x-axis is labeled "Month". A legend
    appears on the right side showing "Monthly Sales" and "Trend Line". There's also
    a subtle note in the upper right area indicating "[Interactive] Use slider to
    change year (2018-2024)". The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle horizontal
    grid lines.
