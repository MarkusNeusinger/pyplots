review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Clear species separation visible in scatter plots showing expected Iris clustering
    patterns
  - Proper use of histograms on diagonal with grouped bars by species
  - Good alpha transparency on scatter points (0.75) to handle overplotting
  - Realistic Iris-like data with appropriate statistical parameters
  - Variable names with units (cm) on all axes
  - Symmetric matrix structure correctly implemented
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels on left side are somewhat small and could be larger for better readability
  - Histogram x-axis tick labels use rotation but show only every 3rd label, making
    it hard to read exact bin values
  - Title font size (48px) could be larger given the 3600x3600 canvas
  - Does not use the highcharts-core Python library as recommended in library rules
    - instead builds raw JSON config
  - Legend placed at very bottom with gap from matrix - could be integrated better
