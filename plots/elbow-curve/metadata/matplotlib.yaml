review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent elbow curve visualization with clear elbow point identification at k=4
  - Professional annotation with arrow pointing to the optimal cluster count
  - Thoughtful diminishing returns shaded region adds educational value
  - 'Color scheme (Python blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B) is visually appealing and
    brand-consistent'
  - Realistic inertia decay pattern that demonstrates the typical K-means behavior
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is defined but not displayed (ax.legend() call is missing), though the
    label parameter and axvspan label are set
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarify unitless nature of inertia
