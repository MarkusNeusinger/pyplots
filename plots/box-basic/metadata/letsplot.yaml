review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic salary data with appropriate distributions per department
  - Outliers properly generated and clearly visible as distinct points
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar implementation
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  - Different colors make categories easily distinguishable
  - Appropriate text sizes (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (currently very subtle with theme_minimal)
