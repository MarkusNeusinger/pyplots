review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Euler integration to trace streamlines in a declarative
    visualization library
  - Clean viridis color encoding showing velocity magnitude increases with distance
    from center
  - Proper use of detail encoding to separate individual streamlines and order encoding
    for correct line drawing
  - Well-balanced streamline density with multiple radii covering the full flow field
  - Title and font sizes meet all readability requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units - should be "X Position (units)" or specify dimensionless
  - Some inner streamlines appear slightly crowded/overlapping near the center
  - Does not leverage Altair interactive features (tooltips, zoom/pan) which would
    enhance flow exploration
  image_description: The plot displays a vortex flow field visualized as concentric
    elliptical/circular streamlines. The plot uses the viridis color scheme, with
    purple/dark colors at the center (lower flow speed ~0.5-1.0) transitioning to
    green and yellow at the outer rings (higher flow speed ~2.5-3.0). The title reads
    "streamline-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top center. The X-axis is labeled
    "X Position" ranging from -3.4 to 3.4, and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Position"
    with the same range. A "Flow Speed" color legend appears in the upper right corner.
    The grid is subtle with light gray lines. Multiple concentric streamlines spiral
    outward from the center, showing the characteristic pattern of a circular vortex
    flow where u = -y, v = x.

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding (detail, order, color scales)
          appropriately. However, doesn't leverage Altair's interactive features which
          could enhance streamline exploration
  verdict: APPROVED
