review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Highcharts polar chart with proper compass direction
    formatting
  - Well-designed wind data with realistic prevailing direction clustering
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple) for time-of-day categories
  - Good code structure with inline JS for headless Chrome compatibility
  - Proper use of highcharts-more.js for polar chart functionality
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size could be slightly larger (radius 14 is adequate but could be ~18 for
    better visibility at 3600x3600)
