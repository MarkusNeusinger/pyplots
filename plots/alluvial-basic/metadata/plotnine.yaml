review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of alluvial diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics
    building blocks
  - Smooth cubic interpolation creates visually appealing curved flow bands
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.5) to show overlapping flows
  - Colorblind-safe palette with strong luminance contrast between parties
  - Clean professional layout with well-positioned legend and clear year labels
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Party names only shown in legend, not directly on or near nodes
  - Some very small transitions create thin bands that are difficult to see or track
