review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic medical research scenario with meaningful treatment
    groups
  - Good jitter width (0.25) spreads points without overlapping adjacent categories
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.65) handles point overlap well
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper reproducibility with seeds for both numpy and jitter
  - Data shows clear differences between treatment groups demonstrating the plot purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme alternates blue/yellow between adjacent categories creating visual
    confusion - a single color or sequential palette would be clearer
  - Grid lines are extremely subtle, almost invisible - could be slightly more visible
    (alpha 0.2-0.3)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic strip plot showing patient response
    times (seconds) across four treatment groups: Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, and Placebo.
    Points are horizontally jittered within each category to reduce overplotting.
    The color scheme uses blue (#306998, #4B8BBE) for Drug A and Drug C, and yellow
    (#FFD43B, #FFE873) for Drug B and Placebo. The y-axis shows "Response Time (seconds)"
    ranging from approximately 10-65 seconds, while the x-axis shows "Treatment Group"
    with the four categories. The title "strip-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with very subtle grid lines (barely
    visible). The Placebo group shows the highest and most spread distribution (25-65s),
    while Drug C shows the lowest and tightest distribution (15-37s), demonstrating
    different treatment effects.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with position_jitter, scale_color_manual, theme_minimal,
          and element_text theming, but nothing particularly advanced beyond basic
          plotnine usage
  verdict: APPROVED
