review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of training dynamics with clear overfitting pattern visible
    after epoch 30
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean, readable code structure
  - Smart annotation showing optimal stopping point with vertical dashed line
  - Well-chosen color scheme (blue/yellow) that is colorblind-accessible
  - Perfect title format and comprehensive axis labeling with loss function specified
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line visibility is inconsistent - some lines appear more prominent than others
    despite same alpha settings
  - 'The Best: 46 annotation could be positioned better - currently placed at a fixed
    y-position that may not scale well with different data'
  - Yellow color for validation loss could benefit from slightly darker shade for
    better contrast against white background
