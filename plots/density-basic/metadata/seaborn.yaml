review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn kdeplot with fill and rugplot showing individual observations
    as per spec recommendations
  - Bimodal distribution (main group + high achievers) effectively demonstrates density
    plot ability to reveal distribution shape
  - Realistic test score scenario makes the visualization immediately relatable
  - Clean simple code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Well-chosen color (#306998) with appropriate alpha values for fill (0.6) and rug
    (0.3)
  weaknesses: []
