review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a non-native chart type by extending pygal Graph class
  - Perfect diverging colormap (blue-white-red) centered at zero for correlation visualization
  - Clear correlation value annotations with adaptive text colors for readability
  - Professional colorbar with proper -1 to +1 fixed range and clear labeling
  - Realistic financial metrics dataset showing varied correlation patterns
  - Clean square canvas layout appropriate for symmetric correlation matrix
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses custom class which violates KISS principle, though necessary given pygal
    lack of native heatmap support
  - Slight excess white space between title and matrix could be reduced
  - Colorbar placement could be slightly closer to the main matrix
