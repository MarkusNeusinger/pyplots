review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn's lineplot with style parameter for automatic marker
    shape differentiation per series
  - Clean, professional visualization with proper font sizing for high-resolution
    output
  - Colorblind-safe custom palette with good contrast between series
  - Realistic data scenario (temperature sensors) that matches the spec's quality
    control application
  weaknesses:
  - Legend frame opacity (framealpha=0.9) is quite opaque; a lower value would be
    more visually appealing
  - Data series patterns are somewhat similar; more variety in trends (e.g., one volatile,
    one cyclical) would better showcase the plot type's utility
  image_description: The plot shows three line series with markers tracking temperature
    readings over 12 hours from three sensors. Sensor A (dark blue circles) stays
    in the 22-24°C range with a slight upward trend. Sensor B (golden yellow X markers)
    starts around 20°C and declines to approximately 16°C. Sensor C (teal squares)
    remains stable around 23-24°C. The title "line-markers · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    is bold at the top. Axes show "Hour" (0-11) on x-axis and "Temperature (°C)" (15-24
    range) on y-axis. A legend in the upper left identifies each sensor. A subtle
    dashed grid aids readability. The 16:9 layout uses space well with balanced margins.

        comment: Uses seaborn's lineplot with hue/style for automatic marker differentiation,
          but could leverage more seaborn-specific features like set_theme() or statistical
          capabilities
  verdict: APPROVED
