review:
  strengths:
  - Clean 4×4 matrix layout with proper use of ggbunch for combining individual plots
  - Excellent color scheme with distinct species differentiation
  - Proper implementation of histogram diagonals and scatter off-diagonals
  - Good use of theme_minimal() and appropriate transparency for overlapping data
  - Title and legend placement are well-balanced
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels abbreviated without units (Sepal Len instead of Sepal Length (cm))
  - Wildcard import style could be cleaner with explicit imports
  - Could use geom_density() on diagonal for smoother distribution visualization as
    alternative
