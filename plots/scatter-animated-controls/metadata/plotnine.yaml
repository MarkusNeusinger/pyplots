review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements static faceted alternative as specified for libraries without
    animation support
  - Excellent Gapminder-style data scenario with realistic GDP, life expectancy, and
    population values
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper aesthetic mappings
  - Good use of scale_color_brewer with correct qualitative palette type
  - Appropriate panel_spacing and strip styling for faceted display
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels overlap slightly due to the 45° rotation combined with limited
    facet width
  - Could use more distinctive plotnine features to showcase the library capabilities
  - Five time points provides limited temporal resolution for understanding trends
  - Empty space in bottom-right of layout due to 5 facets in 3-column arrangement
