review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper aesthetic mappings for
    color and shape
  - 'Well-chosen colorblind-safe color palette (blue #306998 and yellow #FFD43B)'
  - Realistic and meaningful data scenario comparing coastal vs inland temperature
    patterns
  - Proper marker and line sizing for visibility at the target resolution
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis displays numeric month values (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5) instead of month
    names (Jan, Feb, etc.) - the month_labels were created but not used on the axis
