review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Kaplan-Meier step function implementation with proper survival probability
    calculation
  - Clear visual separation between Treatment (blue) and Control (yellow) groups with
    colorblind-friendly palette
  - Correctly implemented 95% confidence intervals as shaded bands using Greenwood
    formula
  - Censored observations properly marked with vertical tick marks on the curves
  - 'Helpful median survival annotation box showing Treatment: 22.4 months vs Control:
    16.9 months'
  - Clean clinical trial scenario with realistic survival data (150 patients, 36-month
    follow-up)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses functions (kaplan_meier) which violates KISS principle - should be inline
    calculations
  - Does not use any seaborn-specific plotting functions (only sns.set_style) - relies
    entirely on matplotlib for actual plotting
