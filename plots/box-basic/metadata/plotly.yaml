review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three well-placed annotations (highest/lowest
    median callouts and salary gap insight) that guide the viewer through the key
    findings
  - Strong visual quality with all font sizes explicitly set well above minimums,
    no overlapping elements, and a polished off-white background
  - 'Good data design: five departments with meaningfully different distributions
    (varying means, spreads, and sample sizes) plus a visible outlier in Sales'
  - 'Effective use of Plotly-specific features: interactive hover templates with currency
    formatting, HTML export alongside static PNG, and the native annotation system'
  - Clean, well-structured code following the KISS pattern with appropriate complexity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is hidden (showlegend=False) — while categories are identifiable from x-axis
    labels, a compact legend could reinforce the color-category mapping
  - Annotation arrow for Lowest median points slightly away from the actual median
    line position on HR, making it look like it points between the box and the annotation
    rather than precisely at the median
  image_description: 'The plot displays five box-and-whisker plots arranged horizontally,
    one for each department: Engineering (steel blue), Marketing (orange), Sales (pink/rose),
    HR (purple), and Finance (green). The y-axis shows "Annual Salary ($)" with dollar-formatted
    ticks from $20,000 to $140,000+ at $20,000 intervals. The x-axis shows "Department".
    The title "box-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in a large
    bold font. Each box shows a distinct distribution: Engineering has a high median
    (~$93k) with moderate spread; Marketing clusters around $75k; Sales has the widest
    spread reaching from ~$25k to ~$117k with one outlier near $148k; HR has the narrowest
    box centered around $65k; Finance shows a higher median (~$85k) with moderate
    spread. Two annotation callouts with arrows highlight the highest median (Engineering,
    $93,096 in blue) and lowest median (HR, $64,846 in pink/rose). A summary box in
    the upper-right corner reads "Median salary gap: $28,249". The background is a
    very light off-white with subtle horizontal gridlines.'
