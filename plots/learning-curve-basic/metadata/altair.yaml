review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen font sizes and line thickness
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color palette (Python blue and gold)
  - Proper confidence bands using mark_area with appropriate opacity
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following library idioms
  - Realistic simulated data showing classic learning curve behavior
  weaknesses:
  - Legend configuration uses resolve_legend which creates duplicate legend behavior
  - Missing interactive features (tooltips, hover) for exploring exact values
  - Y-axis scale could be tighter to better show validation curve detail
  image_description: "The plot displays a model learning curve with two distinct curves\
    \ against a light gray grid background. The title \"learning-curve-basic · altair\
    \ · pyplots.ai\" appears at the top in a large, readable font. The X-axis is labeled\
    \ \"Training Set Size (samples)\" ranging from 100 to approximately 980 samples.\
    \ The Y-axis is labeled \"Accuracy Score\" ranging from 0.66 to 1.02. \n\nThe\
    \ **blue line** represents Training Score - it starts high around 0.98 and remains\
    \ relatively stable with a very slight downward trend, surrounded by a light blue\
    \ shaded confidence band. The **yellow/gold line** represents Validation Score\
    \ - it starts lower around 0.74 and shows the characteristic learning curve improvement,\
    \ rising to approximately 0.86 as training data increases, with a wider yellow\
    \ confidence band that narrows as more data is added. A legend box in the top-right\
    \ corner clearly distinguishes the two curve types with appropriate color coding."

          boxes due to `resolve_legend(color="independent")` which is confusing

        comment: Uses layered charts (`alt.layer`) and `mark_area` for bands, but
          doesn't leverage Altair's interactivity or tooltips which would enhance
          learning curve exploration
  verdict: APPROVED
