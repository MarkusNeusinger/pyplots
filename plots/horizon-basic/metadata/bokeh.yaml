review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart technique with proper band folding and
    color intensity mapping
  - Uses colorblind-friendly blue/orange palette that clearly distinguishes positive
    from negative values
  - 'Good use of Bokeh features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with custom tooltips
    showing original values, varea for smooth bands'
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with 6 distinct servers and 200 time points
    each
  - Well-structured color legend explaining the band meanings
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with stacked subplots filling the space effectively
  weaknesses:
  - The color legend at the very top, while present, could be more visually prominent
    and integrated
  - The axis label Hour of Day could include units (e.g., Hour of Day 0-24h)
