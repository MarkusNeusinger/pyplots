review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (HoverTool showing name and connections,
    pan/zoom/reset tools)
  - Clean force-directed layout implementation that clearly shows community structure
  - Node sizes properly scale with degree (connection count), making hub nodes visually
    prominent
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between groups
  - Smart label positioning that avoids canvas edge issues
  - Well-styled legend with appropriate sizing for the large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: includes Social Network prefix instead of strict {spec-id}
    · {library} · pyplots.ai format'
  - Network layout leaves some empty space in corners; could be better centered/distributed
