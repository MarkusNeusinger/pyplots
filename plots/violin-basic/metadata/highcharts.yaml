review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choices with four distinct distribution shapes (normal, bimodal,
    shifted normal, skewed) showcasing violin plot capabilities
  - Gradient fills with center-to-edge transparency create a polished professional
    look
  - All font sizes explicitly set and perfectly readable at 4800x2700
  - 'Clean visual refinement: removed axis lines, removed ticks, subtle grid, generous
    margins'
  - Rich HTML tooltips with formatted statistics (n, mean, median, Q1/Q3, std dev)
  - Overall mean reference line provides useful context for cross-group comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Blue and cyan colors could be slightly similar for some forms of color vision
    deficiency
  - IQR boxes are plain dark rectangles — more refined styling could improve polish
  image_description: The plot displays four violin shapes representing test score
    distributions across study groups (Control, Tutorial, Self-Study, Intensive).
    Each violin is rendered as a PolygonSeries with horizontal gradient fills — center
    opaque fading to transparent edges. Colors are steel blue (#306998), golden yellow
    (#E5AB00), medium purple (#9467BD), and cyan (#17BECF). Dark IQR boxes sit inside
    each violin spanning Q1–Q3, with white horizontal median lines crossing each at
    the median position. A dashed "Overall Mean (51)" reference line spans the full
    width. The y-axis reads "Test Score (points)" from 0–110 with subtle gridlines
    every 10 points. The x-axis reads "Study Group" with category labels. A floating
    legend in the upper right shows all four categories plus "Median". The title "violin-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with subtitle "Distribution of scores
    across 200 students per group." The Control violin is bell-shaped centered ~50,
    Tutorial is distinctly bimodal (wide body spanning ~25–85), Self-Study is a tighter
    bell centered ~60, and Intensive is right-skewed with a long thin tail reaching
    ~103. The layout is clean with no axis lines, no tick marks, and generous margins.
