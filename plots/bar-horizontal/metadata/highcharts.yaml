review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text readability with appropriately scaled font sizes for 4800×2700
    canvas
  - Data is sorted ascending (smallest at top) making Iceland (85%) appear at the
    bottom as the leader - good visual hierarchy
  - Clean, professional appearance with subtle grid lines and well-placed data labels
  - Realistic, relatable data scenario (renewable energy by country)
  - Proper use of Highcharts bar chart type with inline JS for headless Chrome compatibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis title could be more prominent or positioned better
  - X-axis tick labels every 2% create visual clutter; every 10% or 20% would be cleaner
