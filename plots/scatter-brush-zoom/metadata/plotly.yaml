review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of brush selection with visual feedback (selected markers
    become larger and fully opaque, unselected become transparent)
  - 'Good use of Plotly-specific features: hover templates, modebar customization,
    selection styling'
  - Clear user instructions via annotation explaining interaction patterns
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Well-structured clustered data perfect for demonstrating brush selection use cases
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) without meaningful units or context
  - Does not demonstrate how selection state can be accessed programmatically (as
    mentioned in spec notes)
  - No count of selected points shown (spec suggests showing count of selected points
    in a status area)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an interactive scatter plot with 4 distinct
    clusters plus outliers. Cluster A (blue, #306998) is positioned in the lower-left
    around coordinates (20, 30). Cluster B (yellow/gold, #FFD43B) occupies the upper-middle
    area around (50, 70). Cluster C (green, #4CAF50) is in the right-center area around
    (80, 40). Cluster D (pink, #E91E63) is in the lower-center around (60, 20). Gray
    outliers are scattered throughout the plot area. The title "scatter-brush-zoom
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Axis labels show "X Value" and
    "Y Value" with a subtle grid. A legend on the right identifies all 5 categories.
    An instruction annotation at the bottom reads "Drag to select • Scroll to zoom
    • Double-click to reset". Markers have white edge highlighting and semi-transparent
    fill (0.75 opacity).'
