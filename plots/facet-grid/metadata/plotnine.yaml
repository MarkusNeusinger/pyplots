review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with facet_grid for proper two-variable
    faceting
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with logical data generation
  - Good colorblind-safe palette choice (Set2) and appropriate alpha for point visibility
  - Proper categorical ordering of faceting variables using pd.Categorical
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels appear incorrectly positioned/inverted relative to the data
    points
  - Facet panels have excessive spacing creating large empty gaps in the visualization
  - The differences between facet conditions could be more visually pronounced
  - Legend order does not match the visual ordering of species in the panels
