review:
  strengths:
  - Clever isometric projection implementation to simulate 3D in a 2D library
  - Depth-based opacity creates effective visual depth perception
  - White stroke on points improves visibility and separation
  - Tooltips preserve original x, y, z coordinates for inspection
  - Pan and zoom interactivity added appropriately
  - Well-separated clusters clearly demonstrate spatial relationships
  - Professional color scheme with Python-inspired blue as primary color
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels Projected X and Projected Z are technically accurate but could mention
    they represent transformed 3D coordinates
  - The Y axis shows Projected Z which may confuse users expecting standard 3D axis
    orientation
  - Center-left canvas area appears empty due to cluster positioning in projected
    space
  - Legend positioned at default right location could be integrated more elegantly
