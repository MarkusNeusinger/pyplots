review:
  strengths:
  - Gradient fill via imshow + PathPatch clipping is a sophisticated, visually striking
    technique that goes well beyond basic fill_between
  - Data generation is rich and realistic with upward trend, weekend dips, noise,
    and a viral spike — all telling a coherent story
  - The Viral post annotation with arrow adds narrative value and demonstrates matplotlib
    annotation capabilities
  - All text sizes follow the library guidelines exactly (24/20/16pt) ensuring perfect
    legibility at full resolution
  - Code is clean and well-structured with clear comments explaining each section
  weaknesses: []
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart titled "Website Traffic
    · area-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The X-axis is labeled "Day of Month"
    (1–30) and the Y-axis is labeled "Daily Visitors (count)" (0–~9000). The area
    beneath the line is filled with a vertical gradient transitioning from a light
    sky blue (#d6e6f5) at the bottom to a deep Python blue (#306998) at the top, achieved
    via an imshow layer clipped to the area polygon. A solid blue line (linewidth
    3) traces the upper boundary. The data shows an overall upward trend from ~3000
    to ~5000 visitors with periodic weekend dips and random noise. A dramatic spike
    on day 18 reaches ~8200 visitors, annotated with a bold "Viral post" label and
    an arrow pointing to the peak. The grid uses subtle dashed lines at alpha 0.3.
    The layout is well-balanced with tight_layout applied, and the plot fills the
    canvas effectively.
