review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of realistic energy data showing diverse compositions across countries
  - Clean, professional layout with well-positioned horizontal legend
  - Perfect compliance with title format and spec requirements
  - Good use of Plotly features including text labels inside segments and HTML interactive
    export
  - Colorblind-safe palette with Python blue (#306998) as primary color
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle gridlines on y-axis would help readers estimate exact percentages
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing the energy
    mix across six European countries (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Poland).
    Each bar is divided into five colored segments representing different energy sources:
    Renewables (dark blue #306998), Nuclear (yellow #FFD43B), Natural Gas (teal #45B39D),
    Coal (coral/red #E74C3C), and Other (purple #9B59B6). All bars are normalized
    to 100% with percentage labels displayed inside each segment in white text. The
    title "bar-stacked-percent · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A horizontal
    legend sits below the title identifying all five energy components. The y-axis
    is labeled "Energy Share (%)" ranging from 0-100%, and the x-axis is labeled "Country".
    The chart uses a clean plotly_white template with balanced margins.'
