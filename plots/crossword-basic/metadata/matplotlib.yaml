review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of 180-degree rotational symmetry
  - Clean, newspaper-style monochrome design perfect for printing
  - Numbers positioned correctly in top-left corner of starting cells
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for crossword grids
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Could use slightly larger font for clue numbers at very high resolution displays
  - np.random.seed(42) is present but not actually used since data is deterministic
  image_description: The plot displays a 15x15 crossword puzzle grid with traditional
    newspaper-style formatting. White cells are used for letter entry, while black
    cells (dark gray, nearly black) create the blocking pattern. The grid exhibits
    proper 180-degree rotational symmetry. Clue numbers (1-72) are displayed in blue
    (#306998) in the top-left corner of cells that start across or down words. Grid
    lines are subtle gray (#333333) providing clear cell separation. The title "crossword-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue, bold text. The overall
    layout is clean, monochrome, and suitable for printing.
