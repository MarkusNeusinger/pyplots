review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent rose chart implementation using lets-plot coord_polar with geom_bar
  - Beautiful blue-to-yellow color gradient that follows Python brand colors and provides
    clear value differentiation
  - Proper month ordering using pd.Categorical to maintain natural calendar sequence
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate theme_minimal with well-tuned text sizes (24pt title, 18pt y-axis,
    16pt month labels)
  - Chart starts at January at top (12 o'clock) as recommended in spec for time data
  weaknesses:
  - Radial gridlines (panel_grid_major_y) could be more subtle with lower alpha for
    cleaner appearance
  - The y-axis title appears on the left side which is slightly awkward for polar
    coordinates
