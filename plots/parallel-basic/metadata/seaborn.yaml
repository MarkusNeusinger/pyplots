review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization clarity with well-separated species clusters visible in
    the parallel coordinates
  - Smart use of two-line x-axis labels showing both dimension names and original
    data ranges
  - Good transparency handling allows overlapping patterns to remain visible
  - Clean, readable code structure with proper data normalization
  - Colorblind-friendly palette choice
  weaknesses:
  - External data dependency (URL fetch) reduces reproducibility compared to inline
    data generation with fixed seed
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features rather than relying on lineplot
    as a workaround
  image_description: 'The plot displays a parallel coordinates visualization using
    the Iris dataset. Four vertical axes represent the normalized measurements: Sepal
    Length (4.3-7.9 cm), Sepal Width (2.0-4.4 cm), Petal Length (1.0-6.9 cm), and
    Petal Width (0.1-2.5 cm). Lines connect each observation across all dimensions,
    colored by species: blue (#306998) for setosa, yellow (#FFD43B) for versicolor,
    and green (#4CAF50) for virginica. The title follows the required format "parallel-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The legend is positioned in the upper right corner with
    clear species labels. Lines have good transparency (alpha=0.5) allowing overlap
    patterns to be visible. The y-axis shows "Normalized Value" from 0 to 1.'

        comment: Uses sns.lineplot with units parameter which is a valid approach,
          but seaborn doesn't have a native parallel coordinates function. The implementation
          is more of a matplotlib solution with seaborn theming. Could have leveraged
          more seaborn-specific features.
