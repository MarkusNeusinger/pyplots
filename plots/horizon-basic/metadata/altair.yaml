review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the horizon chart concept with proper band folding
    and color intensity encoding
  - Realistic server monitoring scenario with distinct patterns for each server type
    (Database daily cycle, Cache spikes, Worker batch processing)
  - Clean use of Altair's faceting for multi-series comparison in compact vertical
    space
  - Proper use of declarative color scale mapping for positive/negative bands
  - Well-organized data transformation to create band data from raw time series
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels use technical codes (positive_0, positive_1, etc.) instead of human-readable
    descriptions like Low, Medium, High intensity
  - Could add interactivity (tooltips) to leverage Altair strengths for exploring
    specific time points
