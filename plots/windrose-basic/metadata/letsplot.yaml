review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate implementation with correct North orientation and clockwise
    direction
  - Professional color scheme progressing from cool to warm that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic wind data simulation with Weibull distribution and direction-dependent
    speed variation
  - Clean 16-sector binning with appropriate speed categories matching meteorological
    conventions
  - Good use of coord_polar with proper start=0 and direction=1 parameters
  weaknesses:
  - No lets-plot distinctive features used (tooltips, interactivity exported to HTML
    could be enhanced)
  - Radial axis label Frequency (%) appears on left side which is unconventional for
    polar plots
