review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using two separate pygal charts combined with PIL to achieve
    the navigator effect
  - Proper use of fill=True in navigator to highlight selected range vs full data
  - Custom styling with appropriate font sizes and colors for the large canvas
  - Good data generation with trend, seasonality, and noise to make the visualization
    meaningful
  - HTML version also generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Main chart legend is truncated (shows "Sensor Reading..." instead of full label)
  - Navigator Y-axis labels (30,40,50,60,70,80,90) are too cramped and hard to read
  - Navigator chart lacks clear visual separation handles for the selection
  image_description: 'The plot displays a two-panel visualization with a main line
    chart on top and a smaller navigator chart below. The main chart shows a blue
    line representing "Sensor Readings (Feb 2023 - Aug 2023)" with Y-axis labeled
    "Sensor Reading (mV)" ranging from approximately 50 to 90, and X-axis labeled
    "Date" with rotated date labels showing dates from 2023-02-05 to 2023-07-30. The
    line shows seasonal variation with visible noise. The navigator chart below has
    a gray background and shows the "Full Dataset (2022-2024)" with a filled blue
    area, and the selected range is highlighted in yellow/gold color ("Selected: Feb
    2023 - Aug 2023"). The main chart title uses the correct format "line-navigator
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". The navigator shows the full 3-year range with year labels
    visible.'
