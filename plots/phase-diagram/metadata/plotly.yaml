review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent physics example with analytically correct damped harmonic oscillator
    solution
  - Multiple trajectories clearly demonstrate basin of attraction structure
  - Direction arrows effectively show time evolution without cluttering the plot
  - Color scheme provides excellent contrast and is colorblind-accessible
  - Title format correctly follows spec requirements
  - Hover templates provide useful interactivity showing exact x and dx/dt values
  - Fixed point and initial conditions clearly marked with distinct symbols
  - Clean, well-organized code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size on trajectory lines (size=4) could be slightly larger for better visibility
    at full resolution
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is very subtle; 0.2-0.3 would provide better reference without
    being distracting
  - Axis labels lack units (though dimensionless is acceptable for theoretical phase
    diagrams)
  - Does not fully leverage Plotly animation features that could show trajectory evolution
    over time
  image_description: The plot displays a phase diagram of a damped harmonic oscillator
    with two spiral trajectories converging to a stable equilibrium point at the origin.
    The first trajectory (blue, dashed line) starts at position x=2.0 with zero initial
    velocity and spirals clockwise inward. The second trajectory (yellow/orange, dashed
    line) starts at x=-1.5 with initial velocity v₀=3.0, creating a larger spiral
    that also converges to the origin. A red "X" marker indicates the fixed point
    (stable equilibrium) at the center. Green circular markers show the initial conditions
    for both trajectories. Direction arrows along both paths indicate the time evolution.
    The plot has a clean white background with subtle gray gridlines, properly labeled
    axes ("Position x" and "Velocity dx/dt"), and a well-positioned legend in the
    upper left corner showing all four trace types.

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with hover templates (good), but could better leverage
          Plotly's animation capabilities for showing time evolution dynamically,
          or use go.Scattergl for performance
  verdict: APPROVED
