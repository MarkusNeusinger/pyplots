review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly pull parameter to achieve exploded effect with per-slice
    control
  - Clean professional color palette with Python colors and colorblind-safe choices
  - Well-formatted title following the required spec-id format
  - Interactive hover template provides additional value on HTML output
  - Outside labels with connectors keep the pie chart clean and readable
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Plotly interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has unused whitespace at bottom of square canvas; pie could be vertically
    centered better
  - Market share values could show more dramatic contrast to better demonstrate the
    exploded emphasis effect
  image_description: The plot displays a pie chart showing market share analysis with
    6 segments. Company A (35%, yellow) is the largest slice and is visibly exploded/separated
    from the center. Company B (22%, dark blue), Company C (18%, teal), Company D
    (12%, green), and Company E (8%, purple) form the main body. "Others" (5%, gray)
    is also slightly exploded. Each slice displays the company name and percentage
    outside the slice with connector lines. A vertical legend appears on the right
    side. The title "Market Share Analysis · pie-exploded · plotly · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top. White borders separate the slices, and the chart uses a clean
    white background.
