review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical layout algorithm with proper parent centering over children
  - Clean orthogonal edge routing creates professional org-chart appearance
  - Level annotations on the left side provide clear context without cluttering the
    visualization
  - Color coding by hierarchy level makes structure immediately apparent
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Edge line width (2.5px) could be slightly thicker for better visibility at full
    resolution
  - Hover tooltips only show node labels; could include level or reporting chain information
  - Tree structure is symmetric (each parent has equal children) - more asymmetric
    branching would better demonstrate the algorithm
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart with 16
    nodes arranged across 4 distinct vertical levels. At the top (Level 0) is a single
    dark blue (Python Blue #306998) CEO node. Level 1 shows three yellow (#FFD43B)
    VP nodes (VP Engineering, VP Sales, VP Operations) connected to the CEO via orthogonal
    gray lines. Level 2 contains six light blue (#4B8BBE) Director nodes (Frontend,
    Backend, Americas, Europe, HR, Finance), each connected to their respective VP.
    Level 3 at the bottom has six gray (#646464) Lead nodes (React, API, East, UK,
    Recruit, Acct). The edges use orthogonal routing (right-angle connections) with
    a mid-point horizontal segment. Level labels appear on the left side (Level 0:
    Executive, Level 1: VPs, Level 2: Directors, Level 3: Leads). The title "Organizational
    Chart · network-hierarchical · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    background is clean white with no grid lines or axes visible.'
