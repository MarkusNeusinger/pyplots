review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choice with realistic Pacific Northwest rainfall pattern showing
    clear seasonal cyclicality
  - Code is clean, well-commented, and explains the radar-vs-rose limitation honestly
  - Good font sizing for the 3600×3600 canvas
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  - Effective use of pygal styling system with custom colors and font sizes
  - Transparent fill (opacity=0.75) allows gridlines to remain visible
  weaknesses:
  - Radar chart is fundamentally different from rose chart (connected polygon vs discrete
    wedges) - this is a library limitation
  - Legend placement in bottom-left corner is disconnected from the chart with excessive
    whitespace
  - Month labels could be more prominently sized for 3600×3600 canvas
