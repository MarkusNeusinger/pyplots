review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution in Treatment B showcasing why
    raincloud plots are valuable
  - Clean implementation using Altair layer composition for combining violin, boxplot,
    and strip components
  - Good color accessibility with blue-yellow-green palette
  - Proper use of transform_density for KDE calculation
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Realistic reaction time data context with appropriate value ranges
  weaknesses:
  - The rain falling from cloud visual metaphor is not optimal - in a vertical layout
    the rain points should appear more clearly BELOW the cloud, but they appear to
    the LEFT at a similar vertical level
  - Some jittered points overlap each other within categories - consider wider jitter
    range or smaller point size
  - Legend has unnecessary stroke border adding visual clutter
  - X-axis labels are created manually with mark_text rather than using native axis
    encoding
