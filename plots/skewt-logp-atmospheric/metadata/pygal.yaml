review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper data generation
  - Correct implementation of the skew transformation for temperature isotherms
  - Realistic atmospheric sounding data with appropriate temperature/dewpoint profiles
  - Proper title format and chart sizing at 4800x2700 pixels
  - Uses pygal custom Style for professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Pressure axis orientation is incorrect - should be inverted with surface
    (1000 hPa) at bottom, decreasing upward to 100 hPa at top, following meteorological
    convention'
  - 'Missing required reference lines: dry adiabats (potential temperature lines),
    moist adiabats (equivalent potential temperature lines), and mixing ratio lines'
  - Dewpoint line should be dashed to distinguish from temperature (solid), as specified
  - Y-axis label says Altitude (log scale) which is misleading - should show pressure
    levels in hPa
  - Legend at bottom is too small and only shows 5 of 7 series (20C and 40C isotherms
    missing)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Skew-T Log-P atmospheric diagram implemented
    using pygal''s XY chart. The chart shows two main profile lines: a red Temperature
    line and a blue Dewpoint line, both with circular markers at data points. The
    temperature profile shows values decreasing from about 25°C at surface level to
    around -55°C at upper levels, while the dewpoint profile runs parallel but lower,
    ranging from 18°C at surface to about -65°C at upper levels. The Y-axis shows
    "Altitude (log scale)" from 0 to 1 (representing log10(1000/pressure)), and the
    X-axis displays "Temperature (°C, skewed)". Three diagonal dashed reference lines
    represent isotherms at -40°C, -20°C, and 0°C. The background is light gray with
    subtle grid lines. A legend at the bottom shows Temperature, Dewpoint, -40°C,
    -20°C, and 0°C entries. The title correctly uses the format "skewt-logp-atmospheric
    · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
