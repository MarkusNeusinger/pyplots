review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of PDP with comprehensive visualization including ICE
    lines, confidence band, and rug plot
  - Clean code structure using sklearn partial_dependence for proper ML interpretation
  - Professional color scheme with yellow main line contrasting against blue uncertainty
    elements
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with layered geoms
  - Good choice of realistic weather-related feature names for the regression context
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the different plot elements (main PDP line, ICE lines,
    confidence band)
  - The rug plot is very subtle and may be hard to see; could use slightly taller
    segments
