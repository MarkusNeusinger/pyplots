review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with proper color stops for perceptual uniformity
  - Clean implementation of 2D histogram binning with numpy, translated to Highcharts
    heatmap format
  - Proper handling of headless Chrome screenshot with inline JS (avoiding CDN issues)
  - Realistic financial returns scenario with correlated bivariate data
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Sparse tick labels (every 5th bin) prevent overlap while maintaining readability
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines to help read values at specific positions
  - Colorbar could have more descriptive title (e.g., Frequency Count instead of just
    Count)
