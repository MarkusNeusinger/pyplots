review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of four distinct distribution types (normal, shifted,
    bimodal, right-skewed)
  - Clean implementation of the violin-swarm hybrid using Highcharts polygon and scatter
    series
  - Good swarm positioning algorithm that keeps points within violin boundaries
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast between violin fills and point
    colors
  - Proper use of transparency (alpha 0.4) on violins so points remain visible
  - Professional title formatting following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good subtitle providing context about the data
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function swarm_positions() slightly deviates from KISS principle (though
    justified for algorithm complexity)
  - Legend at bottom is somewhat redundant with X-axis category labels
  - Some swarm points in dense regions could benefit from smaller marker size or more
    aggressive horizontal spreading
  image_description: 'The plot displays 4 violin plots with overlaid swarm points
    for reaction times across experimental conditions (Control, Condition A, Condition
    B, Condition C). Each violin shows the kernel density estimation as a semi-transparent
    filled shape with darker-colored individual data points (circles with white borders)
    overlaid. The colors used are: blue for Control, golden-yellow for Condition A,
    purple for Condition B, and teal for Condition C. The title "violin-swarm · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently at the top, with a subtitle "Reaction Times
    Across Experimental Conditions". The Y-axis shows "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging
    from ~150 to ~530, and the X-axis shows "Experimental Condition" with the four
    category labels. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all four conditions with
    their respective colors. The distributions show distinct shapes: Control has a
    normal distribution centered around 350ms, Condition A is centered lower around
    280ms with a long tail toward lower values, Condition B shows a bimodal distribution
    spanning 320-510ms, and Condition C shows a right-skewed distribution from ~270-480ms.'

        comment: Swarm points are visible with white borders providing good contrast
          against the violin fill. However, some points within the denser regions
          of the violins are slightly difficult to distinguish individually.

        comment: Grid is subtle, but the legend placement at the bottom is somewhat
          redundant since the X-axis already shows category names.

        comment: Uses PolygonSeries for custom violin shapes and ScatterSeries for
          swarm points. Uses highcharts-more.js for polygon support. Good use of library,
          though no highly distinctive interactive features.
