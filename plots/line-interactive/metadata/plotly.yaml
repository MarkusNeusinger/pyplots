review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features (rangeslider, rangeselector, hover
    templates)
  - Well-crafted realistic data with daily cycles, trend, noise, and anomaly spikes
  - Perfect title format following pyplots conventions
  - Clean visual design with appropriate text sizes and layout
  - Good use of hovertemplate for formatted datetime and percentage display
  weaknesses:
  - Missing visible legend in the plot (trace has name but legend not shown)
  - Pandas import is unnecessary - could use numpy for date generation
