review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario with test scores across schools - immediately comprehensible
  - Clear visual hierarchy with yellow median lines contrasting well against blue
    violins
  - Proper quartile visualization with IQR bars inside violins
  - Text sizes perfectly calibrated for 4800x2700 output
  - Good variation in distributions showing different spread and center characteristics
  weaknesses:
  - Test score values exceeding 100 are unrealistic for typical percentage-based scoring
  - Could use matplotlib built-in quartile visualization (showquartiles parameter)
    instead of manual vlines
  - Missing legend element (though not critical for this plot type)
