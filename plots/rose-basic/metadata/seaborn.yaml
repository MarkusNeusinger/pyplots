review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with well-chosen Blues gradient palette creating an intuitive
    rainfall theme
  - Correct implementation of rose chart starting at 12 o'clock (top) and proceeding
    clockwise
  - Value labels on each bar aid precise reading without cluttering the visualization
  - Proper use of polar projection with radius proportional to value (not area)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Radial gridlines with units (mm) help users estimate values
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; primarily relies on matplotlib for the
    polar bar chart with only sns.color_palette used
  - Grid legend explaining the color gradient is missing (though arguably not needed
    for single-series data)
  - Corner whitespace in square format is unavoidable but slightly reduces canvas
    efficiency
  image_description: The plot displays a rose/Nightingale chart showing monthly rainfall
    data in millimeters. The chart is circular with 12 segments (one per month), starting
    at January at the 12 o'clock position and proceeding clockwise. Each segment uses
    a gradient from the "Blues" seaborn palette - lighter blues for earlier months
    transitioning to darker blues for later months. The bar heights (radii) are proportional
    to rainfall values, with June showing the highest rainfall (168mm) and February
    the lowest (72mm). Each bar has a value label positioned just outside it. Radial
    gridlines are shown at 50mm, 100mm, and 150mm with subtle gray dashed styling.
    The title reads "Monthly Rainfall (mm) · rose-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at
    the top. The layout uses a square 12x12 inch format appropriate for radial plots.

        comment: Uses seaborn color palette (sns.color_palette) but the actual plotting
          uses matplotlib's polar bar chart. No seaborn plot functions like sns.barplot
          are used (polar bars aren't natively supported by seaborn).
  verdict: APPROVED
