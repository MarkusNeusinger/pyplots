review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of dependency arrows with three distinct types and appropriate
    colors
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics approach with layered segments and text
  - Well-designed custom legend explaining dependency types
  - Clear visual hierarchy between group headers and individual tasks
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - The size parameter in geom_segment may trigger deprecation warnings (consider
    using stroke for line width)
  - Group headers could be more visually distinguished from tasks (spec mentions indentation)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart for a software development project
    with four phases: Requirements (blue tasks), Design (yellow tasks), Development
    (green tasks), and Testing (purple tasks). Each phase has a dark blue header bar
    spanning its duration, with individual tasks shown below. Dependency arrows connect
    tasks using three colors: red for Finish-to-Start, blue for Start-to-Start, and
    green for Finish-to-Finish relationships. Task labels are positioned to the right
    of each bar. The x-axis shows a timeline from Jan 07 to Mar 03 with angled date
    labels and a "Timeline" label. A legend in the lower right explains the three
    dependency types. The title "gantt-dependencies · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left.'
