review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Python Blue (#306998) and Python Yellow (#FFD43B) as a thematic
    diverging palette — on-brand and colorblind-safe
  - Conditional text color (white on dark blue, dark on light) ensures readability
    across the entire range
  - Data tells a clear recovery story that is immediately apparent from the color
    gradient progression
  - Clean, idiomatic plotnine code with appropriate use of scale_fill_gradient2 and
    scale_color_identity
  - Bold value annotations with +/- signs make precise values easy to read
  weaknesses:
  - Title font size is 22pt, below the recommended 24pt minimum for the output resolution
  - Axis labels are empty strings — for a standalone visualization, even minimal labels
    like Quarter and Department would improve clarity
  - Layout has some extra whitespace at the bottom due to rotated x-axis labels; tighter
    margins could improve canvas utilization
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x8 heatmap titled "Quarterly Growth by
    Department · heatmap-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". Eight departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, HR, Research, Support) are on the Y-axis
    and eight quarters (Q1 ''23 through Q4 ''24) on the X-axis. Each cell is colored
    using a diverging blue-white-yellow gradient: blue (#306998) for negative growth,
    cream/white near zero, and yellow (#FFD43B) for positive growth. Every cell contains
    a bold annotation showing the growth percentage with a +/- sign. Text color adapts
    — white on dark blue cells, dark gray (#333) on lighter cells. White borders separate
    tiles. A colorbar on the right labeled "Growth (%)" ranges from approximately
    -20 to +20. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees. The data tells a clear recovery
    story: left columns (2023) are predominantly blue (negative), transitioning to
    yellow (positive) on the right (2024), with varying recovery rates across departments.'
