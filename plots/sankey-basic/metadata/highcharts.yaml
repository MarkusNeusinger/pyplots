review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent energy flow scenario matching the spec example use case
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette for node differentiation
  - Proper link opacity (0.5) helps with readability where flows cross
  - Well-structured multi-stage flow showing transformation (sources → electricity
    → end uses)
  - Canvas well-utilized with balanced layout
  - Correctly follows Highcharts library rules for PNG export via Selenium
  weaknesses:
  - Coal and Electricity node labels have poor contrast (white/light text on similarly
    light or busy background areas)
  - No explicit units shown for flow values
  - Could benefit from link color gradients to show flow origin more clearly
