review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine geom_path with proper grouping by streamline ID for
    trajectory visualization
  - Creative solution using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp to compute streamlines since
    plotnine lacks native streamline support
  - Beautiful blue-to-yellow color gradient that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of coord_fixed for 1:1 aspect ratio appropriate for vector field visualization
  - Clean professional appearance with well-sized text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function velocity_field which violates the KISS principle (no
    functions/classes rule)
  - Streamlines do not indicate flow direction (no arrows or visual cues showing which
    way the flow goes)
  - 16:9 aspect ratio leaves empty horizontal space for this circular pattern; 1:1
    canvas would be more appropriate
  - All streamlines are nearly perfect circles with similar appearance - could benefit
    from more varied starting points to show field topology better
