review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including shaded zones,
    formula annotation, and optimal point marker
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with no unnecessary complexity
  - Good use of Plotly-specific features like vrect for shaded regions and comprehensive
    layout configuration
  - Visually clear with distinct line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) enhancing curve
    differentiation
  - Proper title format and professional typography throughout
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid-legend spacing: The legend slightly competes visually with the Overfitting
    zone label'
  - Color scheme could be more colorblind-accessible (consider a different yellow
    shade)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a bias-variance tradeoff visualization with four distinct curves on a light background. The x-axis represents "Model Complexity" ranging from "Low" to "High" via "Medium", while the y-axis shows "Prediction Error" from 0 to 0.9. Four curves are rendered:

    - Bias² (blue dashed): Starts high (~0.5) at low complexity and decreases asymptotically toward zero
    - Variance (yellow/gold dashed): Starts near zero at low complexity and increases exponentially toward ~0.65 at high complexity
    - Irreducible Error (gray dotted): A constant horizontal line at 0.1
    - Total Error (solid red): U-shaped curve showing the sum, with minimum around complexity ~4.3

    The plot features two shaded regions: light blue on the left labeled "Underfitting (High Bias)" and light yellow on the right labeled "Overfitting (High Variance)". A red star marker indicates the optimal complexity point where total error is minimized, with a vertical dashed red line extending down to the x-axis labeled "Optimal Complexity". A formula box displays "Total Error = Bias² + Variance + ε". The legend is positioned in the upper right corner with clear entries for all elements.
