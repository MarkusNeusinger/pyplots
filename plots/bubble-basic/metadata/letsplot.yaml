review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the ggplot grammar of graphics with clean, readable code structure
  - Realistic market analysis scenario that clearly demonstrates the three-variable
    relationship
  - Perfect title format and well-labeled axes with units
  - Appropriate alpha (0.6) for handling overlapping bubbles
  - Good bubble size range (3-18) that shows variation without overwhelming the chart
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could have lower alpha for even more subtle appearance
  - Could leverage more letsplot-specific interactive features given the library strengths
    in this area
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with a light blue/steel blue
    color scheme on a white background with subtle dotted grid lines. The x-axis shows
    "Revenue (Million USD)" ranging from 10 to 200, and the y-axis shows "Growth Rate
    (%)" ranging from 0 to 30. There are approximately 40 bubbles of varying sizes
    scattered across the plot, with bubble sizes representing "Market Share (%)" as
    shown in the legend on the right side. The legend shows five reference bubble
    sizes for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% market share. The title "bubble-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The bubbles have a transparency (alpha)
    applied, allowing overlapping bubbles to remain visible. The data shows a general
    negative correlation between revenue and growth rate, with higher-revenue companies
    tending to have lower growth rates.
