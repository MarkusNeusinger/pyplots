review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label positioning strategy that completely prevents text
    overlap
  - Clean declarative layering approach combining timeline_line + connectors + points
    + labels
  - Good use of Altair tooltip system for interactivity in HTML output
  - Well-chosen color palette with Python blue (#306998) as primary
  - Appropriate marker sizing (600) and connector width (3) for visibility
  - Perfect real-world data scenario (software project milestones)
  - Correct title format and axis configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is defined in code but not visible in the rendered PNG output - needs debugging
    or repositioning
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) on white background has reduced contrast compared to other colors
