review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent wind rose visualization with proper meteorological conventions (North
    at top, clockwise direction)
  - Beautiful color progression using seaborn YlOrRd palette from cool to warm
  - Realistic simulated wind data with dominant SW and secondary NE patterns matching
    real-world scenarios
  - Clean stacked bar implementation with white edges for visual separation
  - Well-positioned and styled legend with proper title
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit radial axis label (should indicate Frequency or similar)
  - Seaborn is used primarily for styling rather than seaborn plotting functions -
    actual bars drawn with matplotlib polar bar plot
