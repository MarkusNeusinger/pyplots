review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation using scatter plot with square markers to create waffle
    grid effect
  - Perfect colorblind-safe palette with Python blue and complementary colors
  - Clean white borders between squares enhance visual separation
  - Legend includes percentages making data immediately interpretable
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Grid fills logically from bottom to top
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Category names are generic (Product A/B/C/D) rather than a realistic scenario
    like budget allocation or survey responses
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10x10 waffle chart grid representing market
    share distribution across four product categories. The chart uses a clean white
    background with the title "waffle-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" centered at
    the top. The grid is filled from bottom to top: Product A (dark blue #306998)
    occupies the bottom 4+ rows (42 squares), Product B (yellow #FFD43B) fills the
    next 2-3 rows (28 squares), Product C (green #4DAF4A) takes approximately 2 rows
    (18 squares), and Product D (pink #E377C2) fills the top portion (12 squares).
    Each square has a white border creating clear separation. A vertical legend on
    the right side displays category names with their percentages: "Product A (42%)",
    "Product B (28%)", "Product C (18%)", "Product D (12%)".'

        comment: Uses ScatterSeries with square markers creatively to create waffle
          effect, but this is a workaround rather than a native Highcharts feature
  verdict: APPROVED
