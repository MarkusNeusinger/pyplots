review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent adherence to specification: automatically counts raw categorical data
    and sorts by frequency (descending)'
  - Clean, professional appearance with good use of Python Blue color scheme
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Data labels on bars enhance readability without cluttering
  - Realistic survey satisfaction scenario makes the plot immediately understandable
  - Correct implementation of Highcharts PNG export pattern with inline JS embedding
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include contextual units or be more descriptive (e.g., "Number
    of Responses" instead of just "Count")
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features in the HTML output (tooltips
    are standard but animations could be showcased)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a count/column chart showing survey response
    frequencies with 5 categories sorted in descending order by count. The bars are
    rendered in Python Blue (#306998) color. From left to right: "Satisfied" (24 responses,
    tallest bar), "Very Satisfied" (12), "Neutral" (8), "Dissatisfied" (5), and "Very
    Dissatisfied" (1, shortest bar). Each bar has a white data label showing the count
    value positioned at the top. The title "count-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold. The Y-axis is labeled "Count" ranging from 0-26, and
    the X-axis is labeled "Response Category". The background is white with subtle
    gray horizontal grid lines. The chart has good proportions with balanced margins
    and fills the canvas well.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts column series with data labels, proper chart configuration,
          and correct PNG export via Selenium. Could leverage more Highcharts-specific
