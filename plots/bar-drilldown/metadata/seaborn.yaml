review:
  strengths:
  - Effective visual representation of hierarchical drilldown concept using three
    subplots
  - Clear breadcrumb navigation in subplot titles (All › North America › USA)
  - Value labels on bars for precise comparison
  - Click indicators (▼) inside bars communicate interactivity
  - Good use of distinct color palettes per hierarchy level
  - Realistic business data scenario (geographic sales hierarchy)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Different Y-axis scales across panels make cross-panel comparisons difficult
  - Grid styling not explicitly customized (default whitegrid has prominent lines)
  - Text sizes slightly undersized for 4800x2700 canvas (value labels at 14pt)
  - Some color combinations may not be optimal for colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-panel visualization demonstrating
    hierarchical drilldown functionality for sales data. The left panel (Level 1)
    shows three regional bars: North America at $850M (blue #2E86AB), Europe at $620M
    (gold #F6AE2D), and Asia Pacific at $530M (magenta #A23B72). Each bar has a white
    downward-pointing triangle (▼) inside indicating clickability. The middle panel
    (Level 2) shows the drill-down into North America with USA at $480M (teal), Canada
    at $220M (orange-red), and Mexico at $150M (purple), also with drill indicators.
    The right panel (Level 3) shows the deepest level - drilling into USA with New
    York at $200M, Los Angeles at $150M, and Chicago at $130M, with no drill indicators
    since it is the deepest level. The main title "bar-drilldown · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. Breadcrumb navigation is shown in each subplot title (e.g.,
    "Level 2: All › North America"). Value labels are displayed above each bar. The
    background uses seaborn''s whitegrid style with subtle gridlines.'
