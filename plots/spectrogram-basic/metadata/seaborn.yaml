review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of chirp signal showing clear time-frequency relationship
    with bright diagonal trace
  - Proper use of perceptually uniform viridis colormap as recommended in specification
  - Well-formatted colorbar with dB units and appropriate sizing
  - All text elements properly sized for the 16:9 aspect ratio output
  - Correct use of seaborn heatmap for spectrogram visualization with proper axis
    orientation
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines present (minor issue for heatmap plots)
  image_description: The plot displays a spectrogram showing a chirp signal with frequency
    increasing linearly from approximately 100 Hz to 800 Hz over a 2-second duration.
    The visualization uses the viridis colormap (dark purple to yellow), with the
    bright yellow diagonal line clearly showing the frequency sweep against a teal/green
    background representing noise. The x-axis is labeled "Time (s)" ranging from 0.0
    to 2.0, and the y-axis is labeled "Frequency (Hz)" ranging from 0 to 2000. A colorbar
    on the right shows "Power (dB)" with values from approximately -90 to -20 dB.
    The title correctly displays "spectrogram-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai".
