review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear, distinguishable faces for each species
  - Comprehensive legends explaining both species colors and feature mappings
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Proper data normalization as specified
  - Uses real Iris dataset for meaningful visualization
  - Good grid layout with balanced spacing and canvas utilization
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper function create_face_svg() instead of flat KISS structure
  - Not technically using Highcharts library - implements pure SVG instead (understandable
    since Highcharts lacks native Chernoff face support)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 9 Chernoff faces arranged in a 3×3 grid, representing
    samples from the Iris dataset. Three species are color-coded: Setosa (blue), Versicolor
    (yellow), and Virginica (purple) - each with 3 samples. The faces feature varying
    facial characteristics: face width maps to sepal length, eye size to sepal width,
    mouth curvature to petal length, and eyebrow slant to petal width. The title "chernoff-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a descriptive subtitle. Two
    legend boxes on the right side clearly explain the species colors and feature
    mappings. All faces are well-rendered with visible differences between species.'
