review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent sunburst visualization with three clear hierarchical levels (Department
    > Team > Project)
  - Smart use of seaborn light_palette() to create color gradients showing parent-child
    relationships within each branch
  - Effective dual-view layout combining sunburst with summary bar chart using seaborn
    barplot
  - Clear labeling with conditional display based on segment size to avoid clutter
  - Center annotation shows total budget, providing immediate context
  - Good color differentiation between branches (blue, yellow, light blue)
  - Professional styling with sns.set_theme() for consistent poster-quality output
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should use interpunct (·) separator per spec - currently correct
    but data label is prepended
  - Some outer ring labels (CI/CD, Database, Mobile) appear cramped or partially overlap
    with wedge edges
  - The bar chart colors do not match the sunburst branch colors (Engineering shows
    blue in sunburst but bar chart has different mapping due to hue parameter)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a sunburst chart showing a company budget
    breakdown across three hierarchical levels. The visualization consists of two
    parts: (1) a sunburst/donut chart on the left with concentric rings - the innermost
    ring shows three departments (Engineering in blue, Sales in yellow, Marketing
    in lighter blue) with labels in white bold text. The middle ring displays teams
    (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, North, South, Digital, Brand) in varying shades. The
    outermost ring shows projects (Web App, Mobile, API, Database, Cloud, CI/CD, Enterprise,
    SMB, SEO, Ads, Events, Content) in the lightest shades. The center displays "$1,530K
    Total" in blue text. (2) A horizontal bar chart on the right titled "Department
    Totals" showing Engineering ($700K), Sales ($500K), and Marketing ($330K) with
    value labels. The title reads "Company Budget · sunburst-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    at the top.'
