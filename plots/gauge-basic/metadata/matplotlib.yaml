review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib low-level primitives (Wedge, Circle) for custom gauge
    visualization
  - Clean professional appearance with well-proportioned elements
  - 'All spec requirements implemented: semi-circular gauge, color zones, needle,
    value display, tick marks'
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Realistic Current Sales context with sensible threshold values
  weaknesses:
  - Red/yellow/green color scheme follows spec convention but is not colorblind-accessible
  - Could add minor tick marks between major values for finer reading
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart with a white background.
    The gauge arc is divided into three colored zones: red (0-30), yellow (30-70),
    and green (70-100). A dark navy needle points to the value 72, which falls in
    the green zone. The needle has a round center cap. Tick marks with labels (0,
    25, 50, 75, 100) are positioned around the outer edge of the arc. Below the gauge,
    the value "72" is prominently displayed in large blue text, with "Current Sales"
    in smaller gray text beneath it. The title "gauge-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top of the image.'
