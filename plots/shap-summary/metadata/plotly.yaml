review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the SHAP summary visualization concept with proper
    beeswarm-style jittering
  - Correct blue-to-red diverging colorscale (RdBu_r) for feature values as specified
  - Clear vertical reference line at x=0 separating positive/negative impacts
  - Well-organized code with realistic breast cancer dataset feature names
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for 200 data points
  - Interactive hover templates provide additional information on interaction
  weaknesses:
  - Hover template shows normalized feature value (0-1) instead of actual feature
    values which would be more informative
  - The grid styling is functional but could use slightly more prominent styling for
    the zero line
  - Feature importance distribution is relatively uniform - could show more dramatic
    differences between important and less important features
  image_description: The plot displays a SHAP summary visualization with 15 features
    on the y-axis, sorted by importance from top (mean radius) to bottom (smoothness
    error). Each row shows scattered dots representing individual samples, positioned
    horizontally by their SHAP values ranging from approximately -0.3 to +0.3. The
    dots are colored using a diverging blue-to-red color scheme (RdBu_r) where blue
    indicates low feature values and red indicates high feature values. A clear vertical
    black line at x=0 separates positive and negative SHAP impacts. The title "shap-summary
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A colorbar on the right shows the
    feature value scale from Low to High. The background is white with subtle gray
    gridlines.
