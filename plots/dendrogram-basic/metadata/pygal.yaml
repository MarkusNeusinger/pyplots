review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of dendrogram using XY chart segments - creative
    solution for a library without native dendrogram support
  - Clean hierarchical clustering clearly separates the three iris species visually
  - Proper use of scipy linkage function with Ward method for accurate clustering
  - Well-configured custom Style with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - X-axis label rotation (45 degrees) prevents overlap while maintaining readability
  - Correct title format following pyplots convention
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines (y-guides) could be slightly more subtle - currently visible dotted
    lines are acceptable but could use lower opacity
  - The dendrogram branches in the lower portion are somewhat cramped compared to
    the upper sparse area - inherent to the data distribution
