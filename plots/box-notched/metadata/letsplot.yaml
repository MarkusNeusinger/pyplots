review:
  strengths:
  - Clear notched box plot with visible notches around medians for statistical comparison
  - Excellent data design with varied distributions showing outliers in Marketing
    and Sales
  - Good color palette with distinct colors for each department
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Outlier points use gray color instead of matching box fill colors, reducing visual
    cohesion
  image_description: 'The plot displays a notched box plot comparing annual salaries
    across 5 departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations). Each
    department has a distinctly colored box: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow),
    Sales (green), Finance (red/coral), and Operations (purple). The boxes show clear
    notches around the medians representing confidence intervals. Outliers are displayed
    as gray circular points beyond the whiskers - notably visible in Marketing (high
    outliers around $120-125K), Sales (both high outliers at $130-145K and low outliers
    around $28-30K), Engineering (one low outlier ~$64K), and Finance (one low outlier
    ~$55K). The y-axis shows "Annual Salary (USD)" ranging from ~30,000 to 150,000,
    and the x-axis shows "Department". The title "box-notched · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with light grid lines
    on the y-axis only.'

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate; legend hidden (acceptable since x-axis
          labels identify categories) but minor deduction for not showing legend

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar correctly with geom_boxplot(notch=True), but
          could leverage more lets-plot specific features like tooltips for interactivity
  verdict: APPROVED
