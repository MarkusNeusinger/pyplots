review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements S-N curve with logarithmic X-axis and fitted Basquin equation
  - Includes all three key material reference lines (Ultimate Strength, Yield Strength,
    Endurance Limit)
  - Good use of pygal custom Style with appropriately sized fonts for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Data shows realistic scatter with multiple test specimens per stress level
  - Color palette is distinct and accessible
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels overlap/truncate at high cycle values due to logarithmic scale
    rendering in pygal
  - Y-axis is linear but spec recommends both axes use logarithmic scales
  - Legend order (Basquin Fit first) does not match visual prominence order (Test
    Data is primary)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) on a semi-logarithmic
    scale. The X-axis shows "Cycles to Failure (N)" with a logarithmic scale ranging
    from approximately 100 to 10^7, and the Y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)"
    ranging from about 150 to 550 MPa (linear scale). Orange circular markers represent
    the test data points showing the characteristic downward trend of fatigue data
    - high stress at low cycles transitioning to low stress at high cycles. A dashed
    blue line represents the Basquin fit (S-N curve) that follows the data trend.
    Three horizontal reference lines are visible: a red line at 520 MPa for Ultimate
    Strength, a green line at 350 MPa for Yield Strength, and a purple line at 190
    MPa for Endurance Limit. The title "sn-curve-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The legend is positioned at the bottom, showing all five series. The
    background is white with subtle grid lines. X-axis tick labels show some crowding/overlap
    at higher values.'
