review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with readable text, good colors, and balanced layout
  - Creative workaround attempting to simulate interactivity with annotations and
    highlighted regions
  - Realistic temperature data with clear seasonal pattern
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot and styling functions
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is a static visualization library that cannot implement true interactivity
    (hover, zoom, pan, range selection)
  - The specification explicitly requires interactive features that are fundamentally
    impossible with seaborn/matplotlib
  - This implementation should be marked as AR-06 (Not Feasible) since seaborn cannot
    technically implement the interactive aspects of the spec
