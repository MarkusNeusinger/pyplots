review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors that are colorblind-accessible
  - Value labels positioned outside bars make precise comparisons easy
  - Horizontal legend placement keeps the chart area uncluttered
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation across quarters and products
  - Clean KISS code structure following plotly idioms
  - Correctly generates both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is slightly too subtle - 0.2-0.3 would aid value reading
  - Does not leverage plotly-specific features like hover templates with custom formatting
  image_description: The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    data (Q1-Q4) for three product lines. Electronics is shown in dark blue (#306998),
    Clothing in golden yellow (#FFD43B), and Home & Garden in coral/salmon (#E17055).
    Bars are grouped side-by-side for each quarter with value labels positioned above
    each bar. The title "bar-grouped · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    with a horizontal legend below it showing all three product categories. The y-axis
    shows "Revenue ($ thousands)" ranging from 0 to ~400, and the x-axis shows "Quarter"
    with Q1-Q4 labels. The plot uses a clean white template with subtle gridlines.
