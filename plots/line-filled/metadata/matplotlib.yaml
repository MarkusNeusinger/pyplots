review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of fill_between() with proper alpha for semi-transparent fill effect
  - Clean seasonal pattern in data demonstrates the magnitude emphasis purpose well
  - Perfect title format and text sizing following library guidelines exactly
  - Y-axis correctly starts at 0 for proper fill visualization
  - Good color choice (#306998) matching pyplots branding
  - Code follows KISS principle perfectly with clear data generation logic
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use "Month of Year" or "Website Visitors (thousands)")
  - Could add markers at data points to show exact monthly values
  - Library features score limited - could explore gradient fills or secondary styling
