review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following specification
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent theming
  - Creative approach to show data age via dot size (since pygal lacks per-point opacity)
  - Proper axis labels with units
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output leveraging pygal capabilities
  - Clean readable code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Data clusters in small portion of plot leaving ~60% of x-axis empty - should generate
    data that spans the full range
  - Legend text is too small and positioned far from the data
  - Age group differentiation is subtle - all points are similar blue shades making
    it hard to distinguish streaming progression
  - Spec mentions opacity gradient for recency which is not implemented (though pygal
    limitation is acknowledged)
  - Legend labels are generic (Oldest data) rather than contextual (could reference
    time windows)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart showing simulated streaming
    sensor data with Temperature (°C) on the x-axis (range 15-35) and Humidity (%)
    on the y-axis (range 30-80). The title correctly reads "scatter-streaming · pygal
    · pyplots.ai". Data points are clustered primarily in the lower-left portion of
    the plot (temperatures ~15-22°C, humidity ~30-65%). Points are colored in shades
    of blue with 5 series representing data age (Oldest, Older, Recent, Newer, Newest)
    shown in the legend at bottom. Newer data points have slightly larger dot sizes
    to indicate streaming progression. The plot has a white background with subtle
    gray grid lines. However, the data only occupies roughly 30-40% of the x-axis
    range, leaving significant empty space on the right side of the plot.
