review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging RdBu colorscale centered at zero for intuitive correlation
    interpretation
  - Lower triangle masking eliminates redundancy while maintaining readability
  - Dynamic text color (white/black) based on background intensity ensures legibility
  - Rich interactive hover tooltips with correlation strength interpretation
  - Realistic financial metrics scenario with meaningful correlation relationships
  - Proper colorbar with fixed -1 to 1 range and clear tick marks
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees which works but could be cleaner with horizontal
    orientation for this number of variables
