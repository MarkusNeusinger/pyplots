review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gantt chart with clear task hierarchy and phase grouping
  - Dependency arrows with arrowheads effectively show task relationships
  - Color coding by phase makes the visualization easy to understand
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar with layered geom_segments for different visual
    levels
  - Realistic software development project scenario with meaningful task dependencies
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit legend for dependency line styles as mentioned in specification
    notes
  - Dependency arrows could be more visually distinct (e.g., different colors or styles
    for different dependency types)
  - Text sizes could be increased slightly for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart with a software development
    project timeline spanning from January to mid-March 2024. Tasks are organized
    into four color-coded phases: Requirements (blue), Design (yellow), Development
    (green), and Testing (purple). Each phase has a dark blue aggregate header bar
    showing the phase span, followed by individual task bars beneath it. The title
    "gantt-dependencies · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. Task labels
    are positioned to the right of each bar. Gray arrows with triangular arrowheads
    connect dependent tasks, showing finish-to-start relationships (e.g., from "Document
    Specs" to "Architecture Design"). The x-axis shows dates with bi-weekly intervals,
    labeled "Timeline". The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle vertical grid
    lines.'
