review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3x3 facet grid demonstrating plotnine grammar of graphics with facet_grid
  - Well-chosen plant growth study context with clear patterns across soil types and
    light levels
  - Good use of Set2 colorblind-safe palette with appropriate alpha for point visibility
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper categorical ordering
  - Title correctly formatted as facet-grid · plotnine · pyplots.ai
  - Axis labels include units (mL/day, cm) for clarity
  - Facet strip labels use label_both for clear identification of row/column variables
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x3 faceted grid of scatter plots showing
    plant growth data. The columns represent light levels (Low, Medium, High) and
    rows represent soil types (Sandy, Loamy, Clay). Each panel contains scatter points
    for three plant species (Basil in mint green, Fern in orange, Tomato in blue/purple)
    showing the relationship between Water (mL/day) on the x-axis (range 20-70) and
    Growth (cm) on the y-axis (range 0-120). The title "facet-grid · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed at the top in bold. The legend for Species is positioned on the right
    side. Facet labels use "label_both" format (e.g., "light_level: Low", "soil_type:
    Sandy"). Colors are from the Set2 palette. The grid lines are subtle gray.'

        comment: Title is 24pt bold, axis titles 18pt, axis text 14pt, strip text
          14pt bold - all clearly readable. Slightly below optimal for tick labels.

        comment: Uses facet_grid with labeller, scale_color_brewer, theme customization
          - good usage but could demonstrate more advanced plotnine features
  verdict: APPROVED
