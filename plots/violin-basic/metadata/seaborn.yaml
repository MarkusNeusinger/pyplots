review:
  strengths:
  - Bimodal Sales distribution showcases violin plot KDE advantage over box plots
  - Strip plot overlay demonstrates seaborn layered composition pattern
  - Annotations guide viewer to bimodal insight with genuine data storytelling
  - Clean polished aesthetic with custom palette, off-white background, spines removed,
    currency-formatted axis
  - Correct modern seaborn API usage with hue parameter and legend=False
  weaknesses:
  - Strip plot dots extremely faint at alpha=0.25 and size=2.5 — barely perceptible
  - 'Annotation text at fontsize=12 with #555555 color is small and low-contrast for
    4800x2700 output'
  - Split violins not explored though spec suggests considering them
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots arranged horizontally, showing
    salary distributions across four departments: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and
    Support. Each violin is filled with a distinct color — dark blue (#306998) for
    Engineering, salmon/orange (#E8825A) for Marketing, teal green (#5BA38B) for Sales,
    and pink/purple (#C46BAE) for Support. Inner box plots with white median dots
    are visible within each violin. Faint strip plot dots (very low alpha) are scattered
    around each violin. The Sales violin is noticeably wider, with a bimodal shape
    showing concentrations around $55k and $90k, annotated with "Junior cohort" and
    "Senior cohort" labels with arrows. The y-axis shows "Salary ($)" formatted as
    currency ($40k–$120k), x-axis shows "Department". The background is off-white
    (#FAFAFA), all spines are removed, and a subtle horizontal grid is present. Title
    reads "violin-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in medium weight.'
