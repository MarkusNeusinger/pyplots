review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all specification requirements including histogram,
    normal overlay, statistics box, and tail highlighting
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic financial data simulation with appropriate fat tails
  - Good color scheme with distinct highlighting for tail regions
  - Proper density normalization making histogram and normal curve comparable
  - Clear statistics display with monospace font for alignment
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines that could improve readability (plotly_white template
    removes them)
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features (e.g., range slider,
    buttons for different time periods)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of daily returns distribution
    with approximately 40 bins. The main distribution bars are colored in a steel
    blue (#306998), while tail regions beyond 2 standard deviations are highlighted
    in red (#D62728). A yellow normal distribution curve is overlaid for comparison,
    showing that the actual returns have fatter tails than a normal distribution (as
    evidenced by the high kurtosis of 12.802). A blue dashed vertical line marks the
    mean at approximately -0.065%, with red dotted vertical lines marking the ±2 standard
    deviation boundaries at roughly -3.9% and +3.8%. The statistics box in the upper
    right corner displays key metrics: Mean (-0.065%), Std Dev (1.914%), Skewness
    (-1.367), and Kurtosis (12.802). The legend in the upper left clearly identifies
    the blue bars as "Returns Distribution" and the yellow line as "Normal Distribution".
    The x-axis shows "Daily Returns (%)" with percentage formatting, and the y-axis
    shows "Probability Density". The title follows the correct format: "histogram-returns-distribution
    · plotly · pyplots.ai".'
