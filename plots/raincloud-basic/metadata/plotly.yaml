review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all three raincloud components (half-violin, box plot,
    jittered points)
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B clearly demonstrates the visualization ability
    to reveal hidden distribution shapes
  - Clean separation of components with proper positioning using violin side and pointpos
    parameters
  - Realistic experimental data with appropriate variation between conditions
  - Professional styling with subtle grid and good color scheme
  weaknesses:
  - No hover customization or interactive tooltips that would showcase Plotly strengths
  - Legend is completely hidden - while categories are on X-axis, a small legend could
    enhance understanding
