review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart concept with 3 bands per direction
  - Clear visual differentiation between positive (blue) and negative (red) deviations
  - Multiple time series displayed compactly in limited vertical space
  - Proper use of Highcharts multi-axis feature for panel layout
  - Good title format following spec requirements
  - Realistic server monitoring use case that aligns perfectly with spec applications
  - Clean, reproducible code with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use highcharts-core Python library as documented in library rules, instead
    builds JSON manually
  - Y-axis labels are hidden, making it harder to understand the magnitude scale
  - Color scheme while good is not the most colorblind-safe (tritanopia)
  - Subtitle legend could be more prominent or placed as a traditional legend
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizon chart showing "Server CPU Load (24h)"
    for 6 servers (A through F). Each server has its own horizontal panel/row. The
    chart uses a blue color scheme (light to dark: #a6cee3 → #1f78b4 → #033860) for
    positive deviations and a red color scheme (light to dark: #fb9a99 → #e31a1c →
    #67000d) for negative deviations. The x-axis shows "Hour of Day" from 0 to 24
    with tick marks at 4-hour intervals. Each server''s time series is displayed as
    stacked area bands that fold values into color-coded layers. The title follows
    the required format with subtitle explaining the color legend. Server labels appear
    on the left of each row. The chart effectively demonstrates the horizon chart
    concept with multiple overlapping bands showing intensity through color saturation.'

        comment: Title is large and clear (56px), axis labels are readable (32px),
          server labels visible. Subtitle text explaining colors is slightly small
          but readable.

        comment: Uses blue/red scheme which has good contrast but is not fully colorblind-safe
          (red-green is avoided, but red-blue may be challenging for some tritanopia
          cases). However, the light-to-dark intensity still provides good differentiation.

        comment: Subtle grid lines with alpha 0.1. Legend is integrated into subtitle
          rather than traditional legend placement, which works but is less prominent.

        comment: Shows multiple series, both positive and negative deviations, varying
          intensities with 3 bands. Could show more dramatic differences between servers

        comment: Good use of Highcharts multi-axis feature to create stacked panels,
          custom area series with stacking=None for horizon effect. Does not use highcharts-core
          Python library as recommended in library rules, instead builds JSON manually,
          but the approach is valid and works correctly.
  verdict: APPROVED
