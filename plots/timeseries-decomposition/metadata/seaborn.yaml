review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent four-panel layout perfectly matching the specification requirements
  - Manual decomposition implementation is educational and shows clear understanding
    of the concept
  - Color palette is distinctive and colorblind-friendly with good contrast between
    components
  - Realistic airline passenger data scenario with appropriate 10-year monthly timespan
  - Zero-reference lines on Seasonal and Residual panels aid interpretation
  - Clean KISS-style code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels for Trend, Seasonal, and Residual subplots could include units or
    clearer descriptions
  - Uses basic sns.lineplot rather than leveraging more distinctive seaborn features
    like FacetGrid or relplot
  image_description: The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked subplots sharing a common x-axis (Date, 2014-2024). The top subplot "Original"
    shows the raw airline passenger data (Passengers in thousands, 350-800 range)
    as a blue line with clear seasonal patterns and upward trend. The second subplot
    "Trend" displays a smooth orange/red line showing gradual growth from ~400 to
    ~700. The third subplot "Seasonal" shows a repeating yellow/gold sawtooth-like
    pattern oscillating between approximately -100 and +100, with a dashed gray zero-line.
    The fourth subplot "Residual" shows green noise fluctuating around zero (-50 to
    +50), also with a dashed gray zero-line. The main title "timeseries-decomposition
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. All subplots have white backgrounds
    with subtle grid lines.
