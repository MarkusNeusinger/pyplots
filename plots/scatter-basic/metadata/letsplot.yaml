review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot layer_tooltips() for interactive hover information
    — a distinctive library feature
  - Clean shape 21 markers with fill (#306998) and white stroke create a polished
    professional look
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all required features present including transparency,
    labels with units, grid lines, and correct title format'
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed 42)
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages lets-plot interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling elements: a trend line (geom_smooth), correlation annotation,
    or callout for key insights would elevate the visualization significantly'
  - Aesthetic sophistication could improve with subtle background color, refined axis
    formatting, or additional visual hierarchy
  - Data shows only a simple linear correlation — adding deliberate outlier clusters
    or varying density regions would better showcase scatter plot capabilities
  image_description: The plot shows a basic 2D scatter plot with 120 data points rendered
    as filled circles in Python Blue (#306998) with white edge strokes on a clean
    white background. The X-axis is labeled "Study Hours (hrs)" ranging from ~1 to
    10, and the Y-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)" ranging from ~25 to 110. The
    title reads "scatter-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" positioned at the top left.
    A clear positive linear correlation is visible — points move upward from bottom-left
    to top-right with moderate noise/spread. The grid consists of subtle light gray
    lines. The minimal theme provides a clean, uncluttered look. Points have moderate
    transparency (alpha 0.7) that reveals some overlap in denser regions. The overall
    layout is well-proportioned in 16:9 landscape format.
