review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of dendrogram structure using Bokeh primitives
    (line glyphs)
  - Two-color scheme effectively distinguishes cluster levels with colorblind-safe
    palette
  - Biologically accurate iris data clustering with proper species separation
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Rotated labels prevent overlap and maintain readability
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Bokeh web capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label Sample is generic; could be more descriptive like Iris Samples
  - No legend or annotation explaining the blue/yellow color threshold meaning
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical dendrogram visualizing clustering
    of 15 iris flower samples across three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
    The tree structure uses a two-color scheme: blue (#306998) for high-level merges
    above the color threshold and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for lower-level within-cluster
    merges. The Y-axis shows "Distance (Ward)" ranging from 0 to approximately 10,
    with dashed grid lines. The X-axis is labeled "Sample" with 15 rotated labels
    (45°) showing sample names like "Setosa-1", "Versicolor-4", "Virginica-3", etc.
    The title "dendrogram-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. The
    dendrogram correctly shows Setosa samples clustering separately on the left, while
    Versicolor and Virginica samples intermix on the right before merging at a higher
    distance level - biologically accurate for iris data.'
