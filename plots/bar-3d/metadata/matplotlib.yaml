review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with colorbar for depth perception as spec recommends
  - Semi-transparent bars (alpha=0.85) help reveal bars behind taller ones per spec
    guidance
  - Well-chosen viewing angle (elev=25, azim=45) provides good visibility of all bars
  - Professional title format and axis labels with units
  - Realistic sales data scenario with meaningful variation between products and quarters
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could use alpha parameter for subtler appearance
  - Could benefit from slightly more contrast in bar heights (all values in 65-225
    range, some near-zero values would show more variation)
