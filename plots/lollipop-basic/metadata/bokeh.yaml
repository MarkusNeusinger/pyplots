review:
  strengths:
  - Clean lollipop chart implementation using segment + scatter glyphs
  - Excellent use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Good color scheme with Python colors (blue stems, yellow markers)
  - Proper currency formatting on y-axis with NumeralTickFormatter
  - Well-sized elements for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Rotated x-axis labels prevent overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Redundant sorting code (data is already defined in sorted order)
  - Bokeh toolbar icons visible in top-right corner could be hidden for cleaner static
    output
  image_description: The plot displays a lollipop chart showing product sales by category.
    Ten categories are shown on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden,
    Sports, Books, Toys, Food, Beauty, Automotive, Office) with sales values in dollars
    on the y-axis ranging from $0 to ~$85,000. Each data point consists of a blue
    vertical stem (#306998) extending from the baseline to a yellow circular marker
    (#FFD43B) with a blue outline. The data is sorted in descending order from left
    to right. Category labels are rotated at approximately 40 degrees for readability.
    The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines.
    The title "lollipop-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. Y-axis
    values are formatted as currency with thousands separators.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, segment + scatter glyphs, NumeralTickFormatter
          - good Bokeh patterns but no interactive features beyond defaults
  verdict: APPROVED
