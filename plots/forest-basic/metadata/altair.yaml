review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and markers
  - Diamond shape for pooled estimate is distinctive and correctly implemented
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition with 7 layers cleanly combined
  - Weight-proportional marker sizing implemented correctly
  - Appropriate color scheme with blue/yellow contrast
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Helpful tooltips for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The Favors Treatment and Favors Control annotations appear slightly cut off at
    the edges
  - All studies show negative effects favoring treatment - having at least one study
    crossing the null line would better demonstrate forest plot interpretation
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like selection for highlighting
  image_description: The plot displays a forest plot for a meta-analysis with 10 studies
    (Taylor 2023 through Johnson 2018) and a pooled estimate at the bottom. Each study
    is shown with a blue horizontal line representing the 95% confidence interval
    and a blue circular point for the effect size. The marker sizes vary based on
    study weight - larger circles for higher-weighted studies (e.g., Williams 2020,
    Wilson 2022) and smaller circles for lower-weighted studies (e.g., Brown 2021).
    A vertical dashed gray reference line at x=0 indicates the null effect. The pooled
    estimate is displayed as a distinctive yellow diamond with a blue border. The
    x-axis shows "Standardized Mean Difference (95% CI)" ranging from approximately
    -1.20 to 0.20. Study names appear on the y-axis. Text annotations "← Favors Treatment"
    and "Favors Control →" appear near the bottom. The title "forest-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
