review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text and well-balanced layout
  - Perfect spec compliance including title format and all required features
  - Realistic simulated data showing characteristic learning curve behavior with convergence
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  - Blue/yellow color scheme provides excellent colorblind accessibility and contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Accuracy Score 0-1 or metric specification)
  - Could leverage Plotly interactive hover templates to show exact values and fold
    statistics
  - Data shows a relatively mild overfitting scenario; more dramatic gap could better
    illustrate the concept
  image_description: 'The plot displays a model learning curve with two distinct lines
    on a white background. The **Training Score** line (dark blue, #306998) starts
    at approximately 0.98 and gradually decreases to around 0.92 as training set size
    increases. The **Validation Score** line (golden yellow, #FFD43B) starts at approximately
    0.73 and improves to around 0.86, showing the characteristic learning curve convergence
    pattern. Both lines have semi-transparent shaded regions representing ±1 standard
    deviation confidence bands. The x-axis shows "Training Set Size" from 0 to 3000,
    and the y-axis shows "Accuracy Score" from 0.65 to 1.0. The title "learning-curve-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend in the lower right corner
    clearly identifies both curves. Markers are visible at each data point (10 sizes
    total).'

        comment: Uses go.Figure and go.Scatter correctly, creates shaded bands using
          fill="toself", but doesn't leverage Plotly-specific interactive features
          like hover templates or annotations that would enhance the learning curve
          visualization
