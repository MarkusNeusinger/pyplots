review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dashboard layout with clean, professional appearance matching spec requirements
  - Creative use of pygal for sparklines embedded in a PIL-drawn dashboard canvas
  - Proper color coding for status indicators (green/yellow/red) and favorable/unfavorable
    changes
  - Interactive HTML version with responsive CSS grid and embedded SVG sparklines
    from pygal
  - Good use of pygal Style class for customizing sparkline appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (is_favorable_change, create_sparkline, draw_tile) instead
    of flat KISS structure preferred by code guidelines
  - Sparklines could be slightly larger within the tiles for better trend visibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x2 grid dashboard with 6 metric tiles on
    a white background. The title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · pygal · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top in bold black text. Each tile has a light gray (#f8f9fa) background
    with rounded corners and a colored status bar at the top: green for "good" status
    (CPU Usage, Response Time, Throughput, Active Users), yellow for "warning" (Memory),
    and red for "critical" (Error Rate). Each tile contains: the metric name in gray
    text, a large bold value with unit (45%, 72%, 120ms, 2.1%, 1,250req/s, 3,420),
    a change indicator with up/down arrow and percentage in green (favorable) or red
    (unfavorable), and a small blue (#306998) filled area sparkline in the bottom-right
    corner showing the trend. The layout is clean and well-organized with consistent
    spacing between tiles.'
