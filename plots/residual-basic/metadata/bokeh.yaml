review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, HoverTool with custom
    formatting, and Span for reference line'
  - Proper scaling for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriately sized text (72pt title,
    48pt labels, 36pt ticks) and markers (size=40)
  - Realistic housing price regression scenario with meaningful outliers and subtle
    heteroscedasticity
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - The LOWESS/LOESS trend line mentioned in the spec notes as "consider adding" is
    not implemented (optional but would enhance diagnostic capability)
  - Feature coverage could show more pronounced heteroscedasticity pattern for better
    demonstration of this diagnostic feature
  image_description: 'The plot displays a residual scatter plot with 150 blue circular
    markers (color #306998) against a white background. The title "residual-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text. The x-axis is labeled
    "Fitted Values ($K)" ranging from approximately 150 to 500, and the y-axis is
    labeled "Residuals ($K)" ranging symmetrically from approximately -100 to +100.
    A horizontal dashed reference line at y=0 helps assess systematic bias. The markers
    have moderate transparency (alpha=0.6) revealing overlapping points. The plot
    shows random scatter around zero with visible outliers at approximately (+95,
    -80, +85) and a subtle heteroscedasticity pattern. Subtle gray grid lines are
    present. The Bokeh toolbar icons are visible in the top-right corner.'
