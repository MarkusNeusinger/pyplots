review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic context with well-designed simplified coastline polygons
    for all continents
  - Realistic temperature anomaly data generation with polar amplification pattern
  - Clean, readable visualization with proper contour labeling and colorbar
  - Follows KISS coding structure with good reproducibility
  - Professional color scheme (RdYlBu_r) appropriate for temperature data
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is mainly used for styling (sns.set_theme) rather than distinctive seaborn
    plotting functions - the core visualization uses matplotlib contour functions
  - Coastlines are outline-only; could benefit from subtle land fill to enhance geographic
    context
  - Some contour labels (inline text) appear small relative to the figure size
  image_description: The plot shows a global temperature anomaly map with filled contours
    displaying temperature deviations from -2°C to over 4°C. The color scheme uses
    RdYlBu_r (red for warm anomalies, blue for cool anomalies). Simplified coastline
    outlines for all continents (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia,
    Australia) are drawn as black polygon outlines over the contour fill. Black contour
    lines with value labels (e.g., "1.0°C", "2.0°C") are overlaid at selected intervals.
    The axes show Longitude (°) from -150 to 150+ and Latitude (°) from -60 to 80.
    A colorbar on the right shows the Temperature Anomaly (°C) scale. The title follows
    the required format "Global Temperature Anomaly · contour-map-geographic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai". The plot uses a light blue ocean background and shows realistic
    spatial patterns with higher anomalies near polar regions (Arctic amplification)
    and regional variations across the globe.
