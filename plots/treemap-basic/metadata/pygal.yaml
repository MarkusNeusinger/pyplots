review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native Treemap chart type with proper hierarchical data
    structure
  - Good color palette with distinct, well-contrasted colors for each department
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Value formatter displays currency format ($XXK) which aids comprehension
  - Canvas is well-utilized with good proportions
  weaknesses:
  - Subcategory labels (R&D, Infrastructure, Digital, etc.) defined in data but not
    displayed on the rectangles - only values are shown
  - Colors could be more optimized for colorblind accessibility (current palette relies
    somewhat on hue differences)
  image_description: 'The treemap displays a budget allocation visualization with
    4 main department categories represented as large colored rectangles, each containing
    3 subcategory rectangles. The colors used are: steel blue for Engineering, golden
    yellow for Marketing, coral pink for Sales, and teal/cyan for Operations. Each
    rectangle shows its budget value formatted as currency (e.g., "$450K", "$320K").
    The rectangles are sized proportionally to their values - Engineering''s R&D ($450K)
    and Marketing''s Digital ($320K) are the largest. The title "Budget Allocation
    · treemap-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom
    shows all 4 department categories. The layout fills the canvas well with clear
    visual hierarchy.'
