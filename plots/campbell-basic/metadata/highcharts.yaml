review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts-specific plotBands and plotLines to add domain context
    (Idle zone, Normal Operating Range, critical speed indicators)
  - Strong data storytelling through operating zone highlighting and prominent critical
    speed markers
  - Polished visual design with intentional typography, subtle grid, shadow effects,
    and rounded legend
  - Complete spec compliance with all 5 modes, 3 EO lines, and critical speed intersections
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper linear flow and realistic turbomachinery
    data
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two blue hues (#306998 and #2980b9) for 1st Bending and 2nd Torsional are similar
    and may cause confusion — consider replacing one with a more distinct color like
    teal or brown'
  - The 1x EO label at the far right edge appears slightly clipped by the chart boundary
  image_description: 'The plot shows a Campbell Diagram for a turbine rotor rendered
    on a light gray (#fafbfc) background. The title "campbell-basic · highcharts ·
    pyplots.ai" is displayed prominently at the top in dark text, with a subtitle
    "Natural Frequencies vs Rotational Speed — Turbine Rotor" in gray below it. The
    X-axis is labeled "Rotational Speed (RPM)" ranging from 0 to 6000, and the Y-axis
    is labeled "Frequency (Hz)" ranging from 0 to 120. Five natural frequency mode
    curves are plotted as solid lines: 1st Bending (dark blue, rising gently), 2nd
    Bending (green, declining), 1st Torsional (purple, rising moderately), Axial (orange,
    declining slightly), and 2nd Torsional (teal/cyan, nearly flat at ~95 Hz). Three
    engine order excitation lines (1x, 2x, 3x) are drawn as gray dashed lines from
    the origin with increasing slopes, each labeled at the chart edge. Red diamond
    markers highlight critical speed intersections where engine order lines cross
    natural frequency curves. A pale green band marks the "Idle" zone (0-800 RPM)
    and a pale blue band marks the "Normal Operating Range" (2800-4200 RPM). Faint
    vertical dotted lines appear at critical speed RPM values. A floating vertical
    legend in the upper right lists all series with their colors. The layout is clean
    with subtle dotted grid lines and no axis spines.'
