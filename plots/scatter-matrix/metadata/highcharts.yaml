review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette (blue/yellow/purple) for clear species
    differentiation
  - Proper symmetric scatter matrix layout with histograms on diagonal showing distributions
  - Clean 3600×3600 square canvas appropriate for matrix visualization
  - Good use of Iris dataset with realistic variable names and units
  - Species clustering clearly visible especially in petal measurements
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (alpha 0.2-0.3 instead of #e0e0e0)'
  - Bottom-row x-axis tick labels are partially cut off/difficult to read
  - Uses raw Highcharts JS generation instead of highcharts-core Python library
  image_description: 'The scatter matrix displays a 4×4 grid showing pairwise relationships
    between four Iris dataset variables: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal
    Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). The diagonal cells contain stacked histograms
    showing distributions per species. The off-diagonal cells show scatter plots with
    data points colored by species. Three species are shown: Setosa (blue), Versicolor
    (yellow/gold), and Virginica (purple). The title "scatter-matrix · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Variable names appear along the top row and
    left column as axis labels. A legend at the bottom identifies the three species
    with colored circular markers. The colorblind-safe palette uses distinct blue,
    yellow, and purple colors.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts via Selenium rendering with multiple chart containers,
