review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of polar coordinates with correct angular axis rotation
    (90°) starting at top for time-based data
  - Good use of Plotly Scatterpolar with fill=toself creating an informative area
    fill
  - Clear cyclical temperature pattern that demonstrates the value of polar coordinates
    for time-of-day data
  - Well-formatted tick labels showing hours (0h, 2h, etc.) in clockwise direction
  - Proper use of sinusoidal function to generate realistic day/night temperature
    variation
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid visibility could be improved (currently rgba(0,0,0,0.2) is quite faint)
  - 'Minor: the fill area makes the 0 baseline less prominent; an explicit radial
    line at 0 would help'
