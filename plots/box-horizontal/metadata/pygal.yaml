review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using dynamic class creation to achieve horizontal box plot
    in pygal
  - Excellent real-world scenario (service response times)
  - Good use of pygal custom Style system with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Proper use of Tukey box mode for statistical accuracy
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels are NOT displayed on the y-axis - they only appear in the legend
    at bottom, which defeats the purpose of a horizontal box plot
  - Excessive whitespace on right side - x-axis extends to 3200ms but data only reaches
    ~1800ms, wasting ~40% of plot width
  - Outlier dots are very small and difficult to see against the white background
  - Legend is redundant when it should complement y-axis labels, not replace them
