review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent candlestick construction using layered approach (wicks as mark_rule,
    bodies as mark_bar)
  - Clean declarative encoding with proper type annotations (:T for temporal, :Q for
    quantitative, :N for nominal)
  - Comprehensive tooltips showing all OHLC values with proper formatting
  - Good data generation showing realistic price movements with varying volatility
  - Correct title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  weaknesses:
  - Legend for Bullish/Bearish direction is not visible in the rendered output despite
    being configured in code
  - Color scheme uses red-green which is not ideal for colorblind accessibility
  - Missing interactive() method which is Altair signature feature for web-based exploration
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 business days
    of stock price data from January 1 to February 8, 2024. Green (teal) candlesticks
    represent bullish days where the closing price was higher than the opening price,
    while red candlesticks represent bearish days. Each candlestick has a rectangular
    body showing the open-close range and thin wicks (vertical lines) extending above
    and below showing the high-low range. The chart shows a general upward trend peaking
    around Jan 11 (~$110), followed by volatility and a decline toward the end (~$86-90).
    The title "candlestick-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center.
    The Y-axis is labeled "Price ($)" ranging from $84-$112, and the X-axis is labeled
    "Date" with dates formatted as "Jan 01", "Jan 03", etc. A subtle grid is visible
    in the background. No legend is displayed in the visible area.

        comment: Uses declarative grammar with layering (wicks + bodies), proper encoding
          types (:T, :Q, :N), tooltips for interactivity, and scale configuration.
          However, does not use interactive() method which is Altair's main distinctive
          feature
  verdict: APPROVED
