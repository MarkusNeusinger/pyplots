review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using HTML+JavaScript slider to simulate animation
    controls, since pygal lacks native animation support
  - Well-designed interactive HTML interface with year slider, styled year display,
    and smooth chart transitions
  - Realistic Gapminder-inspired data scenario with plausible country development
    trajectories over time
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for appropriate font sizing on large canvas
  - Clean code structure with clear data generation logic
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - 'Missing size encoding: the spec mentions point size for population but all markers
    are uniform size'
  - Current year not prominently displayed on the PNG static preview (spec suggests
    large background text or corner display)
  - Could benefit from showing data labels/tooltips on hover in the HTML version (pygal
    supports this natively)
