review:
  strengths:
  - Correct raincloud layout with cloud on right, boxplot centered, rain on left (vertical
    orientation per spec)
  - Excellent use of pygal XY chart to build complex composite visualization from
    scratch
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between groups
  - Realistic clinical trial reaction time scenario
  - Manual KDE implementation with proper Silverman bandwidth
  - Proper box plot components including whisker caps
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays despite show_legend=False setting - use chart configuration to
    fully suppress
  - Rain dots could be slightly larger for better visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Grid lines are present but could be more subtle (lower alpha)
