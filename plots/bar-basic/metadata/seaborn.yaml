review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured
  - Clean, minimal design with proper spine removal and subtle grid
  - Correct title format and complete spec compliance
  - Realistic product sales data with good value spread across 8 categories
  - Clean KISS code structure with idiomatic seaborn barplot usage
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations to highlight the top performer (Electronics,
    218) and/or lowest (Books, 41), or use color emphasis to guide the viewer''s eye'
  - Aesthetic sophistication is limited to a well-configured default — consider sorting
    bars by value (descending) for a more intentional ranking visualization, or adding
    a subtle color gradient based on value
  - Could leverage more seaborn-distinctive features (e.g., using hue parameter with
    a highlight column to emphasize specific bars)
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 8 product categories
    (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Groceries, Automotive)
    on the x-axis and sales in units on the y-axis (ranging 0–225). All bars use a
    uniform steel-blue color (#306998 / Python Blue). Bold value labels (218, 156,
    73, 134, 41, 95, 187, 62) appear above each bar. The title reads "bar-basic ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" and
    the y-axis "Sales (units)". Top and right spines are removed, leaving a clean
    L-shaped frame. A subtle y-axis grid (low alpha) sits behind the bars. Bars have
    consistent width (~0.7) with adequate spacing. The layout is well-balanced with
    good canvas utilization and no text overlap.

        comment: set_context() and DataFrame-driven barplot are somewhat distinctive.
          Most code is pure matplotlib.
  verdict: REJECTED
