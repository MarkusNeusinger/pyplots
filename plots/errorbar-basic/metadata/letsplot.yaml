review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with proper error bar caps
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with geom_errorbar and geom_point layering
  - Well-chosen experimental data scenario that perfectly illustrates error bar use
    case
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output with appropriate text scaling
  - Good variation in error magnitudes across groups showcases the visualization purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Measured Value (units) would be better)
  - Could demonstrate asymmetric error bars to show full feature coverage as mentioned
    in spec
