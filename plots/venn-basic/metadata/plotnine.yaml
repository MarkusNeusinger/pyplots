review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a Venn diagram using plotnine grammar of graphics
    approach
  - Clean, readable layout with well-positioned count labels in each region
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.45) to show overlap regions clearly
  - Realistic tech team scenario with mathematically consistent intersection counts
  - Proper calculation of exclusive region counts from set totals and intersections
  - Clean theme with hidden axes and grid appropriate for a Venn diagram
  weaknesses:
  - 'Two of the three colors are shades of blue (#306998 and #4B8BBE), which could
    be confusing for colorblind users'
  - Figure size is 12x12 (square) instead of 16x9 as recommended in library guidelines
  image_description: 'The plot displays a classic three-circle Venn diagram showing
    the overlap between Python Developers, Data Scientists, and ML Engineers. The
    three circles are arranged in a triangular formation with significant overlap
    in the center. Colors used are a muted blue (#306998) for Python Developers, yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Data Scientists, and a lighter blue (#4B8BBE) for ML Engineers.
    Each region displays its count: 60 (Python only), 35 (Data Scientists only), 25
    (ML Engineers only), 20 (Python ∩ Data Scientists), 10 (Python ∩ ML), 15 (Data
    Scientists ∩ ML), and 10 (all three). Set labels are positioned outside the circles.
    The title "venn-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The background
    is clean white with no axes or grid lines visible.'

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics well with geom_polygon and geom_text,
          but Venn diagrams are not a native strength of plotnine
  verdict: APPROVED
