review:
  strengths:
  - Clean side-by-side layout effectively communicates the drilldown concept
  - Good use of annotations for Click to drill down and breadcrumb navigation
  - Text is readable with appropriate font sizes
  - Realistic sales data with sensible hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - 'Wrong chart type: Specification explicitly requires PIE CHARTS not bar charts
    - this is a fundamental spec violation'
  - Seaborn lacks native pie chart support but matplotlib.pyplot.pie() should be used
    with seaborn styling
  - Missing animated transitions
  - Visual indicator for clickable elements is limited to text annotation rather than
    cursor/icon
