review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with salary distributions across departments
  - Good color palette with distinct, accessible colors for each department
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - 'Demonstrates box plot features well: different medians, varying spreads, outliers'
  weaknesses:
  - Outliers are displayed as thin horizontal lines rather than individual points,
    making them less visible than spec requests
  - Significant whitespace in lower portion of chart (0-40000 range) due to Y-axis
    starting at 0 when data starts around 40000
  - Legend color indicators are small and could be more prominent
