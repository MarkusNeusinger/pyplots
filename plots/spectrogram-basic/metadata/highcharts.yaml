review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of the chirp signal with frequency increasing over time (diagonal
    yellow band is unmistakable)
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Proper dB scale labeling on colorbar with actual dB values (-100 to -10 dB range)
  - Clean code structure with scipy spectrogram computation
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Appropriate downsampling for Highcharts heatmap performance
  weaknesses:
  - No grid lines on the heatmap area (would improve readability at specific time/frequency
    points)
  - Y-axis shows frequencies up to ~469 Hz but the chirp only goes to 200 Hz (wasted
    vertical space showing noise)
