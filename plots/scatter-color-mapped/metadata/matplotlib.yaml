review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with perceptually uniform color distribution
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic data scenario (geographic temperature measurements) with meaningful
    correlation
  - White edge outlines on markers improve visibility and separation
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good marker sizing and alpha for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like Normalize for explicit color range
    control
  - Grid could be even more subtle (alpha=0.2) to reduce visual noise
  - Colorbar tick label size (16pt) is slightly smaller relative to other labels (20pt)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 150 data points distributed
    across a coordinate system representing longitude (-10° to 10°) on the x-axis
    and latitude (-5° to 5°) on the y-axis. Each point is colored according to a temperature
    value using the viridis colormap, ranging from approximately 2°C (dark purple)
    to 30°C (bright yellow). The color gradient clearly shows warmer temperatures
    (yellow-green) concentrated toward the top-right region and cooler temperatures
    (purple-blue) toward the bottom-left, demonstrating the intended correlation.
    Points have white edge outlines for better visibility. A vertical colorbar on
    the right shows "Temperature (°C)" with appropriate tick marks. The title correctly
    follows the format "scatter-color-mapped · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Grid lines
    are subtle with alpha transparency.
