review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics for a complex geographic visualization
  - Clear acknowledgment that drill-down interactivity requires interactive libraries
    (honest limitation disclosure)
  - Breadcrumb navigation concept well-illustrated even in static form
  - Good color scale with colorblind-safe yellow-to-blue gradient
  - State labels with abbreviation and score provide immediate value understanding
  - Well-documented code with clear comments explaining the static nature limitation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color bar could be taller/more prominent for easier value-to-color mapping
  - Some visual crowding in the Midwest region (IL, IN, OH labels) though still readable
  - Grid lines are subtle to the point of being barely visible
  image_description: 'The plot displays a choropleth-style map of 20 US states showing
    regional performance scores. States are rendered as simplified polygons with white
    borders on a light blue-gray panel background. The color scheme uses a yellow-to-blue
    gradient: light yellow (#FEE08B) for lower scores (64) transitioning to deep blue
    (#1A5276) for higher scores (91). Each state is labeled with its two-letter abbreviation
    and numeric score (e.g., "CA 85", "NY 91", "AZ 64"). A breadcrumb navigation "World
    > USA > States" appears in the upper-left in deep blue, with an italic instruction
    below it. The title uses the correct format "map-drilldown-geographic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" in large bold text, with a subtitle explaining this is a static
    view. Axes show longitude (120°W to 80°W) and latitude (25°N to 50°N) with degree
    labels. The legend on the right displays "Performance Score" with explicit breaks
    at 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, and 91 covering the full data range.'
