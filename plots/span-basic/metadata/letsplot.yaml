review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world scenario using the 2008-2009 recession as the highlighted
    period
  - Clean visual design with appropriate use of semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.25)
  - Well-labeled span with annotation text positioned inside the highlighted region
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_rect, geom_line, and geom_text layering
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label for y-axis lacks units (could be "Economic Index (points)" or similar)
  - Legend title "Highlighted Region" is redundant since it only shows one category
  - Does not demonstrate horizontal span variant mentioned in spec (vertical only)
