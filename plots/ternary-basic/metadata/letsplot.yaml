review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinates from scratch using Cartesian transformation
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining the coordinate conversion
  - Appropriate use of soil classification as a realistic domain example
  - Grid lines and tick labels enhance readability without cluttering
  - Good color choices that are colorblind-accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra text before the required format
  - Legend position could be closer to the plot to reduce empty space
  - Tick label font size could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
