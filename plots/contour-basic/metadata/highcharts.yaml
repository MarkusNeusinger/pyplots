review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements contour lines (isolines) over filled heatmap, addressing
    previous review feedback
  - Contour level labels (10%-90%) are clearly visible with high-contrast white background
    boxes
  - Excellent colorblind-safe viridis palette implementation with smooth color transitions
  - Proper 100x100 grid resolution for smooth appearance
  - Clean title format following spec requirements exactly
  - Good use of Highcharts annotations module for labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Relies on matplotlib to extract contour paths rather than implementing contours
    natively in Highcharts
  - sys.path manipulation to avoid import conflicts is a code smell
  - Grid lines are quite subtle and could be more visible for coordinate reading
  - Contour line colors (black/white switching) work but could be more consistent
