review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's specialized go.Indicator for gauge charts with built-in
    number display and delta calculation
  - Clean color zone implementation with intuitive green/yellow/red convention
  - Prominent value display with delta indicator showing change from previous reading
  - Well-balanced layout with good proportions and clear labeling
  - Interactive HTML version generated alongside static PNG
  - Realistic CPU usage scenario with sensible values and thresholds
  weaknesses:
  - The spec mentions motion blur effect or multiple needle positions to indicate
    dynamic nature, but implementation uses delta indicator instead (reasonable alternative
    but not exact match)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart representing CPU
    Usage. The gauge arc is divided into three color zones: green (0-50%), yellow
    (50-80%), and red (80-100%), following the intuitive traffic light convention.
    A dark blue indicator bar shows the current value at 67%, positioned in the yellow
    zone. The current value "67%" is prominently displayed in large text at the center
    of the gauge, with a green delta indicator showing "+3%" change from the previous
    reading. Tick marks are placed at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. "Min: 0%" and "Max:
    100%" labels appear at the bottom left and right. A "Live Updating (1-5s intervals)"
    annotation with a dot icon is shown at the bottom center. The title "gauge-realtime
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, and "CPU Usage" serves as the gauge
    title.'
