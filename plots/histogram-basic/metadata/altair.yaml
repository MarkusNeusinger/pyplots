review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with annotated peak locations, sample sizes, and mean
    line that guide viewer understanding of the bimodal distribution
  - 'Strong visual refinement: custom bar styling with stroke and corner radius, subtle
    Y-axis grid, clean view with removed borders'
  - Perfect spec compliance including all required features (clear bin edges, readable
    labels, appropriate bin count, Y-axis at zero)
  - Idiomatic Altair usage with declarative layered composition, proper encoding types,
    and dual PNG/HTML output
  - Realistic, neutral dataset with plausible bimodal height distribution at appropriate
    scale
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick density is high (every 2 units from 0-50), creating slight visual
    clutter; coarser tick spacing would be cleaner
  - Annotation font size (16pt bold) is prominent; slightly reducing weight or size
    could improve visual hierarchy
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of human heights in centimeters,
    showing a clear bimodal distribution. The bars are colored in Python Blue (#306998)
    with dark stroke edges and subtle rounded top corners. The X-axis is labeled "Height
    (cm)" ranging from approximately 146 to 198, and the Y-axis is labeled "Frequency"
    ranging from 0 to 50. Two dashed brown vertical lines mark the peak locations
    of the two subgroups: "Primary group (μ ≈ 170 cm, n=350)" positioned to the right
    of its line, and "Taller subgroup (μ ≈ 186 cm, n=150)" positioned to the left
    of its line. A lighter gray dashed line marks the overall mean at 174.8 cm with
    italic text. The title reads "histogram-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle
    "Distribution of human heights — bimodal pattern with primary and taller subgroups".
    The background is clean white with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines on the
    Y-axis only at low opacity. Overall layout is well-balanced with the plot filling
    the 4800x2700px canvas appropriately.'
