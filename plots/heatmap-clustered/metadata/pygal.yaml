review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal extensibility by creating a custom ClusteredHeatmap class
    that builds on pygal Graph base
  - Biologically meaningful gene expression dataset with clear tumor vs normal differentiation
  - Working dendrograms on both axes using scipy hierarchical clustering
  - Well-implemented diverging colormap with proper interpolation
  - Proper reordering of rows and columns based on clustering results
  - Clean colorbar with Z-Score title and labeled scale values
  - Good text contrast calculation for potential cell value annotations
  weaknesses:
  - The code uses a custom class which violates KISS structure (though arguably necessary
    for this complex visualization in pygal)
  - Colorbar legend placement could be slightly better integrated with the main plot
  - Column labels are somewhat cramped when rotated at 45 degrees
