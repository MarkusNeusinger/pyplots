review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette using blue, yellow, purple, and cyan
  - Correct raincloud layout with jittered points, box plots, and half-violin density
    curves
  - Realistic reaction time experimental data with meaningful variation including
    bimodal distribution
  - Clean code structure with inline KDE computation
  - Proper title format following the spec convention
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are barely visible, reducing readability of data values
  - Legend symbols do not accurately represent the visual elements (density cloud
    shows a circle instead of filled area)
  - Y-axis range extends unnecessarily (200-700) when data spans roughly 260-640,
    reducing visual impact
  - Box plot fill colors are too transparent making them hard to distinguish from
    background
