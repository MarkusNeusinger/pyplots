review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect implementation of chess board color pattern with correct h1 light square
  - Classic, professional color scheme (#F0D9B5/#B58863) that matches traditional
    chess boards
  - Clean use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and rect glyph for grid construction
  - Proper 1:1 aspect ratio maintains square proportions
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels Column and Row are redundant when a-h and 1-8 notation is already
    present
  - Could leverage Bokeh hover tooltips to show square names (e.g., e4)
  image_description: The plot displays a standard 8x8 chess board with 64 alternating
    squares in classic cream (#F0D9B5) and brown (#B58863) colors. The board uses
    a 1:1 aspect ratio (3600x3600 px square format). Column labels (a-h) appear at
    the bottom with "Column" as the axis label, and row labels (1-8) appear on the
    left side with "Row" as the axis label. The title "chessboard-basic · bokeh ·
    pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Each square has a subtle dark gray border
    (#333333). The h1 square (bottom-right) is correctly colored light, following
    standard chess convention. The background is a light gray (#FAFAFA), providing
    subtle contrast with the board.
