review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with highly readable labels
  - Clean horizontal bar chart with proper descending sort (largest at bottom for
    visual hierarchy)
  - 'Good use of Highcharts-specific features: borderRadius on bars, inline dataLabels,
    subtitle'
  - Realistic business scenario with appropriate sales figures
  - Proper Selenium export with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - The y-axis value axis has no visible tick marks or gridlines in the rendered output,
    making it harder to estimate intermediate values
  - Data labels show K suffix but the axis title says thousands USD - minor redundancy
    in unit notation
  image_description: The plot shows a horizontal bar chart with 10 product categories
    sorted by sales values in ascending order (smallest at top, largest at bottom).
    The bars are displayed in a consistent blue color (#306998). At the top is the
    title "bar-sorted · highcharts · pyplots.ai" in bold black text, with the subtitle
    "Monthly Sales by Product Category" in gray below it. Category labels appear on
    the left y-axis (Pet Supplies at top with 25K, down to Electronics at bottom with
    145K). Each bar has a data label showing the value with "K" suffix positioned
    just to the right of the bar. The layout uses clean white background with no visible
    gridlines on the x-axis (though the y-axis has dashed grid lines). The chart fills
    the canvas well with good margins.

          proper options structure, but could leverage more interactive features like
          tooltip customization
  verdict: APPROVED
