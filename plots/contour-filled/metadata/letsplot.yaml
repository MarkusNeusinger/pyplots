review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with the plasma colormap providing smooth, perceptually
    uniform color transitions
  - Well-designed mathematical surface showing multiple features (peaks, valley, ridge)
    that demonstrate contour capabilities
  - Properly sized text elements following library guidelines (24/20/16pt for title/labels/ticks)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data generation section
  - Overlaid white contour lines at matching 15 bins provide precise level identification
    as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) rather than having a concrete
    real-world context with units
  - Data context is mathematical rather than a real-world application scenario (e.g.,
    topographic elevation, temperature distribution)
