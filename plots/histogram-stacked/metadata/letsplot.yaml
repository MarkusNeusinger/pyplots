review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format following the required pattern exactly
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate text sizes
  - Good use of white borders to separate stacked segments
  - Realistic educational data context with three distinct class distributions
  - Proper use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with geom_histogram and position=stack
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs saved correctly per library requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned with excessive whitespace on the right side
  - Could use more distinctive lets-plot features (e.g., tooltips, flavor themes)
  - Color palette includes red and yellow which may be suboptimal for red-green colorblind
