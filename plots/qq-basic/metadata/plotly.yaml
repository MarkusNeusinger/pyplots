review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual presentation with proper font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Clean implementation of Q-Q plot methodology using Blom's plotting positions
  - Good use of plotly's styling capabilities with plotly_white template
  - Reference line clearly visible with contrasting color and dash style
  - Data demonstrates meaningful deviation from normality for educational value
  weaknesses:
  - Manual implementation of inverse normal CDF is overly complex when scipy.stats
    could simplify this significantly
  - Axis labels lack context (could note these are standardized quantiles)
  image_description: The plot displays a Q-Q (Quantile-Quantile) plot with a white
    background and subtle gray grid lines. Blue circular markers (#306998) represent
    the sample quantiles plotted against theoretical quantiles. A yellow/gold dashed
    diagonal reference line (y=x) runs from the lower-left to upper-right. The title
    "qq-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark text. The x-axis is
    labeled "Theoretical Quantiles" and the y-axis "Sample Quantiles", both ranging
    approximately from -2.5 to 2.5. A legend in the upper-left shows "Sample Quantiles"
    (blue circle) and "Reference (y=x)" (yellow dashed line). The data points largely
    follow the reference line but show slight deviation in the upper-right portion,
    indicating the positive skew from the mixed distribution in the data.

        comment: Uses go.Scatter, proper layout configuration, generates HTML for
          interactivity. However, could leverage plotly's built-in statistical features
          more
