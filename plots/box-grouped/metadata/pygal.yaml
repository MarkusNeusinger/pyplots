review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue/orange/green) clearly distinguishes experience
    levels
  - Realistic employee performance data with meaningful variation across departments
  - 'Correct box plot elements: median, quartiles, whiskers, and outliers all visible'
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Appropriate use of pygal Box chart with Tukey mode for outlier detection
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays 9 redundant entries instead of 3 distinct experience levels; colors
    already repeat the pattern so legend should only show Junior, Senior, Lead
  - Y-axis starts at 0 but data ranges from ~40-105, wasting significant vertical
    space and compressing the visual differences between boxes
