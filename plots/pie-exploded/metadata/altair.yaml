review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper layering technique for explosion effect
  - Good color palette mixing Python blue with colorblind-safe colors
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with square 1:1 format
  - Well-positioned legend with proper font sizing
  - Realistic market share data context
  - Percentage labels clearly visible on all slices
  weaknesses:
  - Explosion effect uses inner radius gaps (donut-style) rather than true radial
    separation from center - slices appear to have holes rather than being pulled
    outward
  - The explosion visual metaphor does not match traditional exploded pie charts where
    slices move radially outward
