review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent thematic data choice: programming language embeddings create a meaningful
    and engaging visualization'
  - Clean ggplot2-style code using proper grammar of graphics pattern
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Appropriate use of alpha transparency (0.85) for text labels
  - Well-configured text sizes following the library guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are barely visible despite configuration (may need higher alpha values)
  - A few text labels are close together (R/MATLAB, SAS/Scala) which could be improved
    with position adjustments
  image_description: 'The plot shows a scatter plot where programming language names
    serve as data points instead of markers. Languages are positioned in a 2D space
    representing "Dimension 1 (Paradigm Similarity)" on the x-axis and "Dimension
    2 (Abstraction Level)" on the y-axis. Five categories are color-coded: Data (teal/green),
    Functional (light blue), General (dark blue), Systems (orange/yellow), and Web
    (golden yellow). The title "scatter-text · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top. A legend on the right identifies the categories. Languages are well-distributed
    across the space with clear clustering by category - functional languages (Haskell,
    Erlang, Clojure) in the lower-left, systems languages (C, Rust, Go, Zig) on the
    right, web languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP) in the upper-middle-right,
    and general-purpose languages (Python, Java, Ruby) in the upper-left. The text
    labels are bold and legible with slight transparency (alpha=0.85).'
