  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with all font sizes explicitly configured and no overlapping
    elements
  - 'Strong data storytelling: mean reference lines with exact values, color-coded
    annotations, and a narrative subtitle that frames the bimodal comparison'
  - Idiomatic lets-plot usage with distinctive layer_tooltips() feature for the HTML
    export
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario (cherry tree cultivars) with appropriate scale
    values
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Annotation labels positioned at y=60 (the exact axis limit) creates slight visual
    tension — a small downward nudge would give more breathing room
  - The bimodal data effectively shows two overlapping distributions but does not
    demonstrate histogram edge cases like outliers or skewness
  image_description: The plot displays two overlapping semi-transparent histograms
    showing the bimodal distribution of cherry tree trunk diameters for two cultivars
    (Yoshino and Kwanzan) in the same orchard. Yoshino bars are rendered in Python
    Blue (#306998) and Kwanzan in warm amber (#B07430), both at ~65% opacity with
    white edge lines separating individual bins. Two dashed vertical reference lines
    mark the population means (~28.5 cm for Yoshino and ~38.8 cm for Kwanzan), with
    bold color-coded annotations at the top of the chart stating the exact averages.
    The x-axis spans 18–52 cm labeled "Trunk Diameter (cm)" with integer tick marks,
    and the y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to 60. The title reads "histogram-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold, with a descriptive subtitle below. A legend
    labeled "Cultivar" with colored swatches sits in the upper-right area. The background
    is white with subtle horizontal gridlines only. The overlap region (30–38 cm)
    clearly shows blended colors, making the bimodal nature of the combined distribution
    immediately apparent.
