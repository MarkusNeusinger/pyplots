review:
  strengths:
  - Well-structured hierarchical data with 3 levels (Region → Country → City) matching
    spec requirements
  - 'Good use of Bokeh-specific features: ColumnDataSource, CustomJS, TapTool, Div
    for breadcrumbs'
  - Clean visual presentation with appropriate colors, value labels, and instructions
  - Correct title format and realistic business data context
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - The drillUp() JavaScript function referenced in breadcrumb onclick handlers is
    never defined, making breadcrumb navigation non-functional
  - X-axis category labels could be larger for better readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - The interactive features (cursor change indicator) are not visible in static PNG
    output
  - No animation transitions between hierarchy levels (spec mentions smooth UX transitions)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with three bars representing
    regional sales data: North America (450, blue #306998), Europe (380, yellow #FFD43B),
    and Asia Pacific (320, blue #4B8BBE). The title "bar-drilldown · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    is positioned at the top left. A breadcrumb navigation showing "📍 All" appears
    in the top-left corner with a light gray background. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales
    (millions $)" and the X-axis shows "Category". Value labels are displayed above
    each bar in bold dark text. An instruction line at the bottom reads "👆 Click on
    a bar to drill down into subcategories | Click breadcrumb links to navigate back".
    The bars have white borders and slight transparency (0.9 alpha). The grid is subtle
    with dashed horizontal lines.'
