review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Correct implementation of cumulative histogram using bar chart with computed cumulative
    proportions
  - Good use of 45-degree label rotation to prevent overlap
  - Realistic test score scenario with properly clipped values (0-100)
  - Both HTML and PNG outputs generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha/opacity) for better visual hierarchy
  - Could use pygal native Histogram() chart type instead of manual computation with
    Bar()
  - Missing tooltips configuration to enhance interactivity in HTML output
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram showing test score distributions.
    It uses a clean blue color (#306998 - Python blue) for all bars on a white background.
    The title "histogram-cumulative · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The
    x-axis is labeled "Test Score Range" with 20 bin labels (33-36 through 96-100)
    rotated at 45 degrees. The y-axis shows "Cumulative Proportion" ranging from 0
    to 1. The bars show a monotonically increasing S-curve pattern typical of a cumulative
    distribution, starting near 0 for low scores and reaching 1.0 at the highest bin.
    Horizontal grid lines are visible at 0.1 intervals. The layout is well-balanced
    with the chart occupying most of the canvas.
