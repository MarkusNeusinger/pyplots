review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements (32pt title, 24pt axis
    labels, 18pt ticks)
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with seasonal pattern (summer peak) and growing
    trend
  - Proper implementation of filled area using fill=tozeroy with appropriate transparency
    (0.35)
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Correct output format (4800x2700 via 1600x900 scale=3) and HTML for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is slightly too subtle - could be 0.2-0.3 for better readability
  - Data could show more realistic noise/variability to demonstrate the plot type
    better
