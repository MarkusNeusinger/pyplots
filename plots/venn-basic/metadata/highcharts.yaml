review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts VennSeries with proper data structure for sets and
    intersections
  - Colorblind-safe palette (Python blue, yellow, purple) with good transparency in
    overlaps
  - Realistic, relatable data scenario (developer skill distribution)
  - Clean data labels showing both set names and values in each region
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Good canvas utilization with the diagram filling most of the space
  weaknesses:
  - Legend does not explicitly map colors to set names (Highcharts Venn limitation)
  - Very slight bottom edge clipping visible in the image
