review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with proper font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Clean visual design with white bar edges clearly separating bins
  - Realistic exam score scenario with appropriate statistical parameters (mean=72,
    std=12)
  - Y-axis correctly starts at zero per specification requirements
  - Proper KISS code structure following all guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Could use additional matplotlib-specific features like mean/median lines or histtype
    variations
  - Data distribution is purely normal; could show slight asymmetry or a few outliers
    for richer feature demonstration
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of exam scores using 20 bins. Bars
    are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998) with white edge lines (1.5px) separating
    each bin clearly. The distribution is approximately normal, centered around 72-75
    points, with frequencies ranging from 0 to ~60 students per bin. The x-axis ranges
    from ~30 to 100 (exam scores in points), and the y-axis shows frequency counts
    starting at 0. The title "histogram-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. Axis labels are descriptive with units ("Exam Score (points)" and "Frequency
    (count)"). A subtle dashed y-axis grid (alpha 0.3) aids readability. The layout
    is clean with good proportions and no clutter.
