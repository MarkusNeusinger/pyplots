review:
  strengths:
  - Clean network visualization with proper directed arrows showing travel direction
  - Effective color-coding distinguishes route types (Express, Regional, Local)
  - Edge labels clearly show route ID with departure/arrival times as specified
  - Multiple routes between same station pair (Central-East) are properly offset
  - Interactive tooltips configured for both edges and stations (works in HTML export)
  - 'Uses lets-plot distinctive features: layer_tooltips, arrow specification, theme_void'
  weaknesses:
  - Legend uses point markers which does not match the segment/arrow styling of edges
  - Some route labels slightly overlap with edges near dense connections
  image_description: 'The plot displays a static transport network diagram with 10
    stations arranged in a roughly circular/grid pattern. Stations are represented
    as dark gray filled circles with white borders, labeled with names below each
    node (Central, North, South, East, West, Airport, University, Harbor, Tech Park,
    Stadium). Directed edges connect stations with arrows indicating travel direction.
    Each edge is labeled with route information in the format "ROUTE_ID | HH:MM →
    HH:MM" (e.g., "RE1 | 06:15 → 06:35"). Routes are color-coded by type: Express
    routes in blue (#306998), Regional routes in gold/dark yellow (#B8860B), and Local
    routes in green (#2E8B57). A legend on the right side shows "Route Type" with
    the three categories. The title "network-transport-static · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top in bold. Multiple routes between the same station pair
    (Central to East) are offset to avoid overlapping. The layout uses a void theme
    with no axes or grid lines.'
