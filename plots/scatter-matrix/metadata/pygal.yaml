review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation approach: uses PIL compositing to create a true scatter
    matrix from individual pygal charts, overcoming library limitations'
  - Clean symmetric 4×4 grid with proper histograms on diagonal and scatter plots
    off-diagonal
  - Good color scheme with blue tones that are accessible and visually appealing
  - Proper use of Iris-like realistic data with meaningful variable correlations
  - Title format is correct and properly centered
  weaknesses:
  - Tick labels on Y-axis are truncated/clipped in some cells (particularly visible
    on bottom-left cells where axis labels appear cut off)
  - The HTML output is just a wrapper displaying the PNG rather than providing true
    interactivity - consider removing it or making it more meaningful
  - Scatter points could benefit from slight alpha transparency (currently opacity=0.7
    in style but dots_size=10 makes some overlapping harder to see)
