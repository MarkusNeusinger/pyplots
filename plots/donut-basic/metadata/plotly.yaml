  strengths:
  - Excellent use of center annotation for total budget display
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette with Python blue as primary
  - White borders between segments improve visual separation
  - Subtle pull effect adds visual interest without distraction
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioning creates slight layout imbalance
  - Could leverage more Plotly interactivity features like custom hover templates
