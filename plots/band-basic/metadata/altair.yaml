quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with mark_area and y/y2 encoding for
    the band
  - Clean layered composition combining band and line charts
  - Realistic uncertainty growth pattern (band widens over time) demonstrates practical
    use case
  - Proper 95% confidence interval calculation using 1.96 * uncertainty
  - Good visual hierarchy with semi-transparent band (opacity=0.3) and prominent center
    line (strokeWidth=4)
  - Correct output format with both PNG and HTML for Altair
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Signal Amplitude lacks units (should include units like mV)
  - No legend or annotation explaining what the band represents (e.g. 95% CI)
