review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar bar chart implementation with proper stacking for wind speed categories
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between segments
  - Realistic meteorological data showing prevailing westerly wind pattern
  - Clean, readable layout with well-positioned legend
  - Proper use of Highcharts polar column type with highcharts-more.js module
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label says Frequency (%) but data values appear to be raw counts, not percentages
  - Could leverage more Highcharts interactive features like data labels on segments
    or custom tooltips
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar bar chart (wind rose) on a white background.
    The title "polar-bar · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with subtitle
    "Wind Speed Distribution by Direction". Eight compass directions (N, NE, E, SE,
    S, SW, W, NW) are labeled around the perimeter in bold text. Stacked bars radiate
    outward from the center, with four color-coded categories: dark blue (Calm <1
    mph), bright yellow (Light 1-10 mph), purple (Moderate 10-20 mph), and cyan (Strong
    >20 mph). The radial axis shows frequency values from 0 to 40, with concentric
    grid circles. A legend is positioned on the right side. The data shows a realistic
    prevailing westerly wind pattern with W, SW, and NW directions having the highest
    frequencies.'

          Radial axis labels are slightly small but still legible.

          Good use of white borders between segments.

        comment: Colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple, cyan) - avoids red-green
          combination.

        comment: Chart is well-positioned to the left with legend on right. Good use
          of canvas space, though slightly more centered would be ideal.

        comment: Y-axis has "Frequency (%)" label but the data appears to be counts,
          not percentages. Minor inconsistency.

        comment: Grid is subtle and appropriate. Legend is well-placed but slightly
          far from the chart.

        comment: Uses Highcharts polar column chart correctly, but doesn't leverage
          more advanced features like tooltips, animation, or data labels. The interactive
          HTML export is good.
  verdict: APPROVED
