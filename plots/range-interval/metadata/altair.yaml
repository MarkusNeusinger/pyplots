review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered composition pattern combining bars, min/max points,
    and midpoint markers
  - Clean declarative encoding with proper data types (N for categorical, Q for quantitative)
  - Interactive tooltips providing detailed information on hover
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leveraging Altair interactive capabilities
  - Appropriate use of opacity and rounded corners for visual appeal
  - Chronological month ordering properly maintained
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend/annotation explaining what the colored markers represent (blue=min,
    yellow=max, diamond=midpoint)
  - Grid opacity is set at 0.3 which is good, but could benefit from explicit grid
    lines for temperature values
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal range interval chart showing monthly
    temperature ranges for a temperate city. Each month (Jan-Dec) is shown on the
    Y-axis with horizontal bars extending from the minimum to maximum temperature.
    The bars are rendered in a blue color (#306998) with 70% opacity and rounded corners.
    Dark blue circular markers indicate minimum temperatures at the left endpoints,
    yellow circular markers indicate maximum temperatures at the right endpoints,
    and small white diamond markers with blue outlines show the midpoint values. The
    X-axis displays "Temperature (°C)" ranging from -5 to 30. The title "range-interval
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The chart follows a logical
    chronological order from January at the top to December at the bottom, showing
    the characteristic seasonal temperature pattern with wider ranges and higher values
    in summer months (Jun-Aug) and narrower ranges with lower values in winter months
    (Dec-Feb).
