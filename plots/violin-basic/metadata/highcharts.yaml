review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent distribution variety showing normal, bimodal, and skewed shapes that
    showcase violin plot capabilities
  - Clean visual refinement with subtle grid (0.08 opacity), removed ticks, and semi-transparent
    fills
  - All font sizes explicitly set for high-resolution output (title 72px, axis titles
    52px, labels 44px)
  - Correct title format and complete legend with all groups plus median marker
  weaknesses:
  - Generic group labels (Group A-D) instead of realistic context-specific names reduce
    data quality
  - Median shown as diamond marker rather than a line as spec requests
  - Group D exponential tail extends to ~122 which is unrealistic for test scores
    and wastes vertical space
  - Does not leverage Highcharts interactive features like custom tooltips showing
    distribution statistics
  - Redundant plot.html file generation alongside the temp file used for screenshot
  image_description: The plot displays four violin shapes arranged horizontally, each
    representing a study group (Group A through Group D). Group A is steel blue (#306998),
    Group B is yellow (#FFD43B), Group C is purple (#9467BD), and Group D is cyan
    (#17BECF). Each violin shows a mirrored KDE density curve with a dark rectangular
    IQR box inside and a white diamond-shaped median marker. Group A shows a roughly
    normal distribution centered around 50. Group B displays a clear bimodal shape
    with humps near 40 and 65. Group C is a normal distribution centered around 60.
    Group D is right-skewed with a very thin tail extending up to approximately 122.
    The y-axis reads "Test Score (points)" ranging from 0 to 130, and the x-axis reads
    "Study Group" with category labels. The title reads "violin-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. A floating legend in the top-right corner lists
    all four groups with colored circle markers plus a "Median" entry with a diamond.
    The background is clean white with very subtle horizontal grid lines. The overall
    layout is well-proportioned though the extended y-axis range (to 130) due to Group
    D's tail creates some wasted vertical space.
