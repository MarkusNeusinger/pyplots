review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements Y-axis inversion using data transformation (inverted_rankings)
    with custom y_labels mapping
  - Clean, readable code with well-commented transformation logic
  - Good choice of sports league context that naturally fits bump chart use case
  - Excellent color palette with five distinct, accessible colors
  - Proper use of pygal Style for consistent theming at target resolution
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper-left corner slightly overlays the plot area; consider
    using legend_at_bottom=True or adjusting legend_box_size
  - Does not utilize pygal-specific interactive features (tooltips, value formatters,
    hover effects) that would enhance the visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bump chart showing sports league standings
    over 6 weeks. The title "bump-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The Y-axis labeled "Rank" shows positions 1-5 from top to bottom (correctly inverted).
    The X-axis labeled "Period" shows Week 1 through Week 6. Five teams are represented
    with distinct colored lines: Team Alpha (blue), Team Beta (yellow/gold), Team
    Gamma (green), Team Delta (red), and Team Epsilon (purple). Each team''s position
    is marked with dot markers connected by lines. The chart shows clear ranking changes
    over time - Team Beta starts at rank 1 but drops, Team Alpha rises to first place
    by Week 6, and Team Gamma has significant volatility. The legend is positioned
    in the upper left. Grid lines are visible but subtle.'
