review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using Highcharts native gauge chart type with proper plotBands
    for color zones
  - Good use of metallic bezel styling that gives professional appearance
  - Value prominently displayed at center as specified
  - Needle color (#306998) matches pyplots brand color
  - Proper inline JS embedding for headless Chrome compatibility
  weaknesses:
  - Uses full circular gauge (300° arc) instead of semi-circular as recommended in
    spec for dashboard widgets
  - Red/yellow/green color scheme is not colorblind-safe; consider using blue/orange/purple
    or other accessible alternatives
