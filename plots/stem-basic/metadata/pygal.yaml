review:
  strengths:
  - Correct stem plot visualization with vertical lines from baseline to data markers
  - 'Excellent data choice: decaying oscillation pattern demonstrates realistic signal
    processing use case'
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Proper title format and good overall layout balance
  - Uses pygal Style system for customization
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label units not rendering in output (parentheses in labels may cause issues
    with pygal)
  - Markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at this data density
  - Does not leverage pygal interactive tooltip features that could enhance the stem
    plot
