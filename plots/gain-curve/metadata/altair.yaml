review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's layered composition pattern with separate charts for
    model curve, area fill, baseline, and custom legend elements
  - Clean implementation of monotone interpolation for smooth curve rendering
  - Good visual hierarchy with shaded area under the model curve providing clear differentiation
    from baseline
  - Proper use of Altair's configure_axis and configure_view for styling
  - Custom legend implementation shows creative use of mark_line and mark_text layers
  weaknesses:
  - Custom legend placement in upper-left overlaps the plot data area slightly; consider
    moving to a less intrusive location
  - The axis labels include (%) in the title text but this could be formatted more
    consistently
