review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range interval concept with clear visual hierarchy
    (bars + endpoint markers + midpoints)
  - Custom hover templates provide interactive data exploration with formatted temperature
    values
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that demonstrates the chart purpose effectively
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of Plotly graph_objects for layered visualization
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows identical yellow markers for Min and Max Temperature - they are visually
    indistinguishable in the legend
  image_description: 'The plot displays a range interval chart showing monthly temperature
    ranges for a temperate climate city. Each month (Jan-Dec) is represented by a
    vertical blue bar (#306998) spanning from minimum to maximum temperature. Yellow
    circular markers (#FFD43B) with blue outlines mark the min and max endpoints of
    each range, while smaller white markers with blue outlines indicate the midpoint
    of each range. The chart follows a clear seasonal pattern: cold winter months
    (Jan, Feb, Dec) show ranges from roughly -7°C to +5°C, while summer months (Jun,
    Jul, Aug) show ranges from approximately +18°C to +31°C. The title "range-interval
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Axes are labeled "Month" (x-axis)
    and "Temperature (°C)" (y-axis). A legend in the upper left identifies Min Temperature,
    Max Temperature, and Midpoint markers. The background uses plotly_white template
    with subtle gridlines.'
