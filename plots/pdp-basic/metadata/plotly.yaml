review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of real sklearn diabetes dataset providing meaningful, interpretable
    results
  - Well-implemented confidence band showing prediction variability
  - Rug plot effectively shows training data distribution along x-axis
  - Zero reference line aids interpretation of relative effects
  - Proper centering of partial dependence values for easier interpretation
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate font sizes and colors
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend incorrectly labels mean ± 1 std as 95% Confidence Interval (should be ±1
    Standard Deviation or compute actual 95% CI)
  - The PDP curve shows step-like artifacts suggesting the gradient boosting model
    structure is visible; a smoother curve would be more typical
