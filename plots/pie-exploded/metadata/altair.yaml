review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, declarative Altair code with proper layering of pie, exploded overlay,
    and labels
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette starting with Python signature blue
  - Well-formatted percentage labels that are clearly readable
  - Realistic market share scenario that demonstrates the use case
  - Proper title format following pyplots convention
  weaknesses:
  - Explosion effect is subtle - uses inner radius trick rather than true positional
    offset; the slice appears slightly separated but not dramatically exploded
  - Pie chart is not vertically centered; positioned in upper portion leaving significant
    empty space below
  - Only one slice is exploded; spec suggests demonstrating 1-3 exploded slices to
    show the feature flexibility
  - Square canvas with pie only filling upper portion reduces canvas utilization
