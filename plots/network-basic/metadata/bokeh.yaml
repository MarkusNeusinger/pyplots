review:
  strengths:
  - Implements custom force-directed layout algorithm that produces well-separated
    community clusters
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features: HoverTool with name and connection
    count, pan/zoom/save tools'
  - Good colorblind-safe color palette with distinct colors for each community
  - Node sizes vary by degree (number of connections), adding visual information
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Bokeh strengths
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance is poor: network forms a diagonal band leaving large empty areas;
    legend is isolated in top-left corner far from the visualization'
  - Title format includes extra Social Network prefix - should be just network-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai
  - Legend text (Communities title and group labels) appears very small relative to
    the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Some node labels may overlap when nodes are positioned close together in dense
    cluster areas
