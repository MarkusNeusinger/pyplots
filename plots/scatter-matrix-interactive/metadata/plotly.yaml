review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using plotly express with minimal code
  - Good use of linked selection/brushing capability (selected/unselected marker styling)
  - Excellent color palette choice (colorblind-safe, good contrast)
  - Interactive HTML export with proper configuration including lasso and box select
    tools
  - Proper axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Diagonal cells show scatter plots (variable vs itself) instead of univariate distributions
    (histograms/KDE) as required by spec
  - Title format includes "Iris Dataset" prefix instead of clean "{spec-id} · {library}
    · pyplots.ai" format
  - No grid lines visible in the subplots
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 4×4 scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) of the Iris
    dataset showing pairwise relationships between four variables: Sepal Length, Sepal
    Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. Three species are color-coded: Setosa (dark
    blue), Versicolor (yellow/gold), and Virginica (teal/cyan). The diagonal shows
    scatter plots of each variable against itself (appearing as diagonal lines). Each
    off-diagonal cell shows a scatter plot of two different variables. The legend
    is positioned in the upper right corner with a white background. The title follows
    the required format at the top. Points have moderate transparency (alpha ~0.7)
    with white edge borders. The species show clear clustering patterns, particularly
    visible in the Petal dimensions where Setosa is distinctly separated from the
    other two species.'
