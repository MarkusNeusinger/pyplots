review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate simulation using Cartesian projection - creative workaround
    for Altair lacking native polar support
  - Clear and readable hour labels positioned correctly around the perimeter
  - Good use of concentric gridlines and radial spokes to create polar grid effect
  - Temperature pattern shows realistic diurnal variation with warmer midday and cooler
    nighttime
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity showing hour and temperature values
  - Yellow line connecting points with blue markers provides good color contrast and
    visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be {spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai but shows Hourly Temperature
    · polar-basic · altair · pyplots.ai - should be polar-basic · altair · pyplots.ai
  image_description: The plot displays a polar chart showing hourly temperature data
    over a 24-hour cycle. The chart uses a white background with a circular layout.
    Concentric dashed gray circles form radial gridlines at 5 different radii. Eight
    radial spokes extend from the center to mark major hours (00:00, 03:00, 06:00,
    09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00), with bold dark gray time labels positioned
    around the perimeter. The data is represented by blue filled circular markers
    (size ~500) connected by a yellow/gold line (strokeWidth 4). The pattern shows
    temperatures are lowest around midday (points extend furthest from center at bottom/12:00)
    and highest at night (points closest to center at top/00:00). The title "Hourly
    Temperature · polar-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a large
    font.
