  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-scaled fonts for the 4800x2700 output
  - Perfect title format matching specification requirements
  - Realistic seasonal temperature data that clearly demonstrates line plot purpose
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Includes both PNG and HTML outputs, leveraging Plotly dual output capability
  - Custom hovertemplate enhances interactivity in HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (current alpha 0.1 is quite subtle)
  - Could leverage more distinctive Plotly features like spike lines, range selector,
    or annotations
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic line chart showing monthly temperature
    data across 12 months (January to December). The line is rendered in a dark blue
    color (#306998) with circular markers at each data point. The chart shows a clear
    seasonal temperature pattern: cold temperatures (~4°C) in winter months (Jan,
    Feb, Dec), rising through spring, peaking in July (~29°C), and declining through
    autumn. The title "line-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    X-axis shows month abbreviations (Jan-Dec), and the Y-axis displays "Temperature
    (°C)" with values ranging from approximately 5-30. Subtle gray grid lines appear
    on both axes. The background is clean white (plotly_white template).'
