review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of SHAP summary plot with proper feature importance ordering
  - Good use of ggplot2 grammar with scale_color_gradient for diverging color scale
  - Appropriate jittering implementation to reduce point overlap
  - Realistic loan/credit model context with 12 meaningful features
  - Correct title format and professional appearance
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include units or clearer description of what SHAP values represent
    in the model context
  - Vertical grid lines are slightly prominent and could be more subtle
  - Some extreme outlier SHAP values (±3) that may distract from the main distribution
