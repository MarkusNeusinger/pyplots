review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap which is perceptually uniform and colorblind-accessible
  - Well-implemented interactive tooltips showing X, Y coordinates and temperature
    on hover
  - Clean data generation with realistic spatial clustering pattern that demonstrates
    correlation between position and temperature
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700 px)
  - Good use of theme_minimal with customized grid styling
  weaknesses:
  - Point size (size=5) could be slightly larger (size=6-7) for 150 data points to
    improve visibility
  - Grid styling uses dashed lines which appear somewhat busy; solid subtle lines
    might be cleaner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a color-mapped scatter plot with approximately
    150 data points spread across a 2D coordinate system. The X-axis ranges from 5
    to 90 meters, and the Y-axis from 10 to 110 meters. Points are colored using the
    viridis colormap (purple to yellow), representing temperature values from approximately
    17°C to 42°C. The colorbar on the right clearly shows "Temperature (°C)" with
    a gradient scale. The title reads "scatter-color-mapped · lets-plot · pyplots.ai".
    The plot uses a minimal theme with light gray dashed grid lines. Points show three
    visible clusters: one in the lower-left (cooler purple/blue tones ~15-25°C), one
    in the center-upper region (mid-range teal/green ~30-35°C), and scattered points
    on the right (warmer yellow/green ~35-42°C). The temperature clearly correlates
    with spatial position.'
