review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of polar coordinates with clear trigonometric
    transformations
  - Well-designed visual hierarchy with clear hour labels and temperature scale
  - Realistic hourly temperature data that demonstrates the cyclical nature polar
    charts excel at showing
  - Clean code structure with comprehensive gridline and label generation
  - Proper use of square canvas (1200x1200 scaled 3x) appropriate for polar charts
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use lets-plot native coord_polar() function which would be the idiomatic
    approach for this library
  - Temperature scale labels positioned only along one spoke; could be more intuitive
    if integrated differently
  image_description: The polar chart displays 24-hour temperature data in a circular
    format. The chart uses a white background with light gray dashed circular gridlines
    representing temperature values and solid gray spoke lines at 3-hour intervals.
    Data points are shown as blue (#306998) dots connected by a blue line forming
    a closed polygon. Hour labels (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00,
    21:00) are positioned around the perimeter in dark gray text. Temperature scale
    labels (2°C, 9°C, 16°C, 23°C, 30°C) appear along the 06:00 (right) spoke. The
    title "polar-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The
    data pattern correctly shows cooler temperatures at night (points closer to center
    around 00:00-06:00) and warmer temperatures during the day (points farther from
    center around 12:00).

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar effectively with geom_path, geom_point, geom_segment,
          geom_text, and theme customization; however, does not leverage lets-plot's
          coord_polar() which would be the idiomatic approach
  verdict: APPROVED
