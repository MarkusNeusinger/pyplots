review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of brush selection with clear visual distinction between
    selected and unselected points
  - Proper use of lets-plot tooltip system for hover information
  - Good clustering data that demonstrates utility of brush selection across multiple
    groups
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided, showcasing lets-plot dual-output capability
  - Selection count annotation adds useful context
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears slightly cut off on the right edge of the image
  - The alpha=0.25 for unselected points may be too faint for some users to distinguish
    clusters
  - Static PNG cannot demonstrate actual brush/zoom interactivity (inherent limitation)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an interactive scatter plot demonstrating
    brush selection and zoom functionality. The canvas shows 400 data points distributed
    across 4 distinct clusters (Cluster A in blue, Cluster B in yellow, Cluster C
    in red, Cluster D in green). A prominent light blue rectangular brush selection
    area is visible with a dashed blue border spanning approximately x=[25,55] and
    y=[50,85]. Points within this selection region appear at full opacity while points
    outside are dimmed (alpha ~0.25). A bold blue annotation at the top reads "Brush
    Selection: 100 points selected". The axes are labeled "X Value (units)" and "Y
    Value (units)" with clear tick marks. The title correctly follows the format "scatter-brush-zoom
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right identifies the four clusters.
    The grid is subtle with light gray lines.'
