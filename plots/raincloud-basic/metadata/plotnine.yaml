review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with properly sized fonts for all elements
  - Good colorblind-friendly palette with distinct blue, yellow, and green
  - Realistic reaction time data with meaningful group differences
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seeds
  - Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geoms
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout violates spec requirement: spec states cloud on TOP, rain BELOW but implementation
    shows cloud on RIGHT, rain on LEFT (horizontal arrangement instead of vertical
    rain falling metaphor)'
  - Full violin displayed instead of half-violin (cloud should only show half to create
    the cloud metaphor)
  - The visual metaphor of rain falling from a cloud is not achieved with the current
    left-right arrangement
