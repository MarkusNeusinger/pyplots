review:
  strengths:
  - Clear polynomial regression curve showing diminishing returns pattern
  - R² value displayed in legend for goodness of fit indication
  - Appropriate data context with plant growth vs sunlight exposure
  - Correct title format following pyplots convention
  - Good color contrast between data points (blue) and regression curve (red)
  weaknesses:
  - Polynomial equation not displayed on plot as suggested in spec
  - Data points lack transparency (alpha=0.7 mentioned in legend but not visually
    apparent)
  - Legend position at bottom creates slight visual imbalance
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with polynomial regression showing
    plant growth (cm) on the Y-axis versus sunlight exposure (hours) on the X-axis.
    Blue circular data points are scattered across the chart, with a coral/salmon-colored
    polynomial regression curve fitting through them. The curve shows a clear parabolic
    pattern - growth increases from 2 hours of sunlight, peaks around 9-10 hours,
    then decreases (diminishing returns). The title "scatter-regression-polynomial
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels are clear with units. The
    legend at the bottom shows "Data Points (α=0.7)" and "Polynomial Fit (R²=0.886)".
    Grid lines are subtle gray. White background with good contrast.
