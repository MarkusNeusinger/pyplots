review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with explicitly set font sizes at all levels (title
    52px, axis titles 38px, tick labels 30px, data labels 28px)
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: correct chart type, title format, data mapping, and
    all recommended features (value labels, consistent widths, single color, adequate
    spacing)'
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario (retail product sales) with good value variation
    and clear ranking
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with deterministic hardcoded data
  - 'Thoughtful visual refinements: dotted grid lines, rounded bar corners, disabled
    credits/legend'
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations to highlight key insights like the top
    performer or the steep drop-off between categories'
  - 'Layout balance needs improvement: x-axis labels and title appear cramped at the
    bottom; reduce marginBottom or adjust spacing for better canvas utilization'
  - Y-axis max extends to 6k when highest value is 4,800, creating unnecessary dead
    space — set a tighter max or remove the 6k gridline
  - Should use the highcharts-core Python library (Chart, HighchartsOptions, ColumnSeries)
    as documented in the library rules instead of raw JSON dict construction
  - Could leverage more distinctive Highcharts features (tooltip formatting, plot
    bands, animation options) to demonstrate library mastery
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical column chart with 6 blue bars (#306998,
    Python Blue) representing product sales by category. Bars are sorted descending:
    Electronics (4,800), Clothing (3,100), Home & Garden (2,200), Sports (1,700),
    Books (950), Toys (480). Data labels with comma-formatted values appear above
    each bar. The title "bar-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    in bold. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (Units)" with tick marks at 0, 1k, 2k, 3k,
    4k, 5k, 6k. The X-axis is labeled "Product Category" with category names below
    each bar. The background is white with dotted horizontal grid lines. Bars have
    subtle rounded corners (borderRadius: 4) and no visible borders.'
