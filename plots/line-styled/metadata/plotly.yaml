review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with all four line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    easily distinguishable
  - Well-chosen realistic scenario with temperature sensors showing believable diurnal
    patterns
  - Proper use of Plotly layout customization for professional appearance
  - Good color palette with distinct, accessible colors
  - Appropriate line width (4) for the canvas size
  - Clean, simple code following KISS principles
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Blue (#306998) and purple (#9C27B0) lines could be more differentiated for better
    colorblind accessibility
  - Could utilize Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates to enhance
    interactivity
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is at the very low end of visibility
