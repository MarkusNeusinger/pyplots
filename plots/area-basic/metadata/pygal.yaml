  strengths:
  - Effective data storytelling with trend line showing +24 visitors/day growth and
    peak/low markers
  - Clean, professional aesthetic with explicitly set font sizes appropriate for 4800x2700
    canvas
  - 'Good use of pygal-specific features: per-series fill toggle, stroke_style dasharray,
    value dicts with labels'
  - Well-chosen realistic data with natural weekly patterns and overall upward trend
  weaknesses:
  - Red and green markers for peak/low are not colorblind-safe; use blue/orange or
    other accessible color pairs instead
  - Axis label 'Visitors' could include units like '(count)' or 'Number of Visitors'
    for full marks
  - The area fill opacity at 0.30 causes the filled region to look washed out in lower-value
    areas, reducing visual weight — consider increasing to 0.35-0.45
  - The trend line manual calculation adds code complexity; consider simplifying or
    using the data more directly
  - Consider improving the visual distinction between the area fill color and the
    trend line color for better contrast
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart titled "Daily Website Visitors
    · area-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" on a white background. The main data series
    is rendered as a light blue filled area with small blue dot markers at each of
    the 30 data points. A dashed orange/tan trend line runs diagonally upward across
    the chart, labeled "Trend (+24 visitors/day)" in the legend. A large red dot marks
    the peak value of 2,150 visitors on Day 24, and a large green dot marks the low
    value of 890 visitors on Day 6. The Y-axis is labeled "Visitors" and ranges from
    approximately 900 to 2,100 with comma-formatted tick values. The X-axis is labeled
    "Day of Month" with labels at days 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. A four-entry
    legend sits at the bottom. The chart fills the canvas well with balanced margins,
    and the area fill uses 30% opacity as specified.
