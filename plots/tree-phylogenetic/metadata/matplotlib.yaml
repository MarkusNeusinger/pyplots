review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent clade coloring with three distinct, colorblind-safe colors (blue, yellow,
    green) representing apes, monkeys, and prosimians
  - Clean, readable phylogenetic tree structure with proper proportional branch lengths
  - Well-formatted title following exact spec convention
  - Scale bar included for reference (0.05 units)
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny with correct evolutionary groupings
  - Clean code structure with pre-computed coordinates for clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the meaning of the three clade colors (blue=apes, yellow=monkeys,
    green=prosimians)
