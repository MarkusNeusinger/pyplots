review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions including bimodal pattern for
    High Dose
  - Clean layer composition with transparent violins and contrasting point colors
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Appropriate use of jitter width to keep points within violin bounds
  - Good color palette with distinct hues for each condition
  weaknesses:
  - Some swarm points extend slightly outside violin boundaries due to jitter
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (lower alpha)
  - Does not utilize lets-plot interactive HTML features beyond basic export
  image_description: 'The plot shows four violin plots with overlaid swarm points
    for reaction time data across four experimental conditions: Control (blue), Low
    Dose (yellow), Medium Dose (light blue), and High Dose (pink/red). Each violin
    has a semi-transparent fill (alpha ~0.4) showing the kernel density estimation,
    with individual data points overlaid on top using jitter. The points use darker,
    contrasting colors compared to the violin fills. The y-axis shows "Reaction Time
    (ms)" ranging from ~240 to ~560ms. The x-axis shows "Experimental Condition" with
    the four category labels. The title follows the correct format: "violin-swarm
    · lets-plot · pyplots.ai". The High Dose condition shows a bimodal distribution
    with visible clusters around 320ms and 400ms. The layout is clean with a subtle
    gray grid and no legend (appropriately hidden since colors encode the same categories
    as x-axis).'

        comment: Uses geom_violin + geom_jitter layering, scale_fill_manual, scale_color_manual,
          theme customization. Uses lets-plot effectively but does not leverage its
          distinctive interactive features.
