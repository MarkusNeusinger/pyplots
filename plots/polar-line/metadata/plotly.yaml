review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data choice: hourly temperature pattern is a perfect real-world use
    case for polar plots, demonstrating cyclical data visualization'
  - 'Proper loop closure: appending first value to close the polar shape is correctly
    implemented'
  - 'Good visual contrast: yellow vs dark blue colors are highly distinguishable and
    colorblind-safe'
  - 'Appropriate sizing: line width=4 and marker size=10 are well-suited for the data
    density'
  - Custom hover templates enhance interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - The radial axis has both a title Temperature (°C) and ticksuffix=°C, creating
    slight redundancy in the center area
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like fill=toself for area between
    lines or animation frames
  image_description: 'The plot displays a polar line chart showing hourly temperature
    patterns across a 24-hour cycle. Two closed lines represent Summer (yellow/gold
    color, #FFD43B) and Winter (dark blue, #306998) temperature patterns. The angular
    axis shows hours from 0:00 to 23:00 arranged clockwise starting from the top (midnight).
    The radial axis displays temperature from 0°C to 35°C with concentric circles.
    Summer temperatures peak around midday (12:00-15:00) at approximately 29-30°C
    and dip to around 14°C at night. Winter temperatures show a similar diurnal pattern
    but at much lower values (peak ~10°C, low ~0°C). The title correctly follows the
    format ''Hourly Temperature Pattern · polar-line · plotly · pyplots.ai''. A legend
    on the right side clearly identifies the two series.'
