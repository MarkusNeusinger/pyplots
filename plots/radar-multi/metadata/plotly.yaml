review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Scatterpolar trace with proper polygon closing technique
  - Clean, professional color scheme using Python brand colors (blue, yellow) plus
    complementary teal
  - 'All spec requirements met: transparency (0.25 alpha), gridlines at proper intervals,
    legend, distinct colors'
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with clear data organization
  - Proper output sizing (1600x900 with scale=3 = 4800x2700 px)
  - Good choice of product comparison scenario that makes the data meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Legend margin (r=200) creates excessive whitespace on the right side of the plot
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific interactive features like custom hover templates
    to show exact values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a multi-series radar chart comparing three
    products across six attributes. The chart shows three overlapping polygons with
    semi-transparent fills: Product A (Premium) in blue/slate color, Product B (Budget)
    in yellow, and Product C (Pro) in teal/cyan. The six axes are labeled: Performance,
    Reliability, Price Value, Support, Ease of Use, and Features. Concentric gridlines
    are visible at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 intervals. The title "radar-multi · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. A legend on the right side identifies
    each product series with colored markers and labels. The background is white with
    subtle gray gridlines.'
