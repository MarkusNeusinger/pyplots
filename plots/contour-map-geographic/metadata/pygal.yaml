review:
  strengths:
  - Creative SVG injection technique to implement contour visualization in a library
    not designed for it
  - Proper marching squares algorithm with segment connection for smooth contour lines
  - Well-designed diverging colormap (blue-red) appropriate for temperature data
  - Good canvas utilization and professional layout at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Contour labels with white background boxes improve readability
  - Includes simplified coastline context for geographic orientation
  weaknesses:
  - Coastlines are very simplified schematic outlines rather than accurate geographic
    features
  - Contour line rendering could be smoother (some angular artifacts visible)
  - No labeling mechanism to identify what the gray polygons represent (coastlines)
  image_description: The plot displays a geographic temperature contour map covering
    the Europe/Atlantic region (longitude -30°E to 50°E, latitude 25°N to 70°N). The
    visualization shows filled contours with color-coded regions from deep blue (cold,
    -4°C) through light blue, pale peach, to red (warm, 24°C). Dark gray contour lines
    (isolines) connect points of equal temperature, rendered as connected paths using
    a marching squares algorithm. Simplified polygon outlines represent European coastlines
    in gray. Temperature labels with white backgrounds are placed strategically showing
    values (-4°C, 0°C, 4°C, 8°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 24°C). A vertical colorbar legend
    on the right side is labeled "Temperature" with values from -4°C to 24°C. The
    title reads "contour-map-geographic · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axis labels
    show "Longitude (°E)" on x-axis and "Latitude (°N)" on y-axis. The light blue
    plot background (#C8DDF0) distinguishes ocean/sea areas. A clear cold anomaly
    appears in the northwest (North Atlantic/Iceland region) and a warm anomaly in
    the southeast (Mediterranean/Turkey region).
