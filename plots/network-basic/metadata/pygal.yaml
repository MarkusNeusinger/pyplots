review:
  strengths:
  - Creative adaptation of pygal XY chart to render network graph (pygal has no native
    network support)
  - Well-implemented force-directed layout algorithm from scratch
  - Clean separation of communities with distinct, accessible colors
  - Interactive HTML output leverages pygal SVG strengths
  - Tooltips with node labels enhance usability
  weaknesses:
  - Node sizes are uniform; spec suggests encoding degree (connection count) in node
    size
  - Network layout appears somewhat linear/elongated rather than compact clustered
    structure
  - Title format includes extra Social Network prefix instead of just spec-id format
  - Legend includes Connections as a separate entry which adds visual noise
