review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly make_subplots to create marginal histograms alongside
    the main 2D histogram
  - Viridis colorscale is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe as recommended
    in spec
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper axis matching between main plot and marginals
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Top marginal histogram (X distribution) appears broken/misaligned - only a single
    spike visible at far left edge instead of showing full normal distribution
  - Subplot specs configuration may have an issue causing the top histogram to render
    incorrectly
  - Axis labels are generic without application context
