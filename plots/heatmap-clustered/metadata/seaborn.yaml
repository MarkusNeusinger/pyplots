review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn clustermap function with all key parameters (method,
    metric, row_colors, col_colors)
  - Well-designed synthetic data with three distinct gene clusters showing different
    response patterns to treatment
  - Clean diverging colormap (RdBu_r) centered at zero, appropriate for expression
    data
  - Informative legends for both gene groups and experimental conditions
  - Proper dendrogram display on both axes demonstrating hierarchical relationships
  - Realistic gene expression analysis context with Control/Treatment experimental
    design
  weaknesses:
  - The Condition legend placement partially overlaps with the Genes y-axis label,
    creating visual clutter
  - The two separate legends (Gene Group and Condition) could potentially be better
    positioned
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered heatmap showing gene expression
    data with hierarchical clustering dendrograms on both rows (left side) and columns
    (top). The heatmap uses a diverging RdBu_r colormap ranging from -3 (blue) to
    +3 (red), centered at 0 (white). There are 30 genes (rows) and 20 samples (columns).
    Row annotations show three gene groups: Immune (blue), Metabolic (yellow), and
    Signaling (green). Column annotations show two conditions: Control (pink/coral)
    and Treatment (light blue). The title "heatmap-clustered · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A colorbar labeled "Expression (z-score)" is positioned on
    the left. Two legends appear on the right side - one for Gene Group and one for
    Condition. The clustering has successfully grouped Treatment samples (T12-T19)
    together on the left and Control samples (C01-C10) on the right, and genes are
    reorganized showing distinct expression patterns.'

        comment: Excellent use of sns.clustermap() which is seaborn's signature function
          for this plot type; includes row_colors, col_colors, Ward linkage, dendrogram_ratio
          customization
  verdict: APPROVED
