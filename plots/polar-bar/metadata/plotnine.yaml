review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual construction of polar coordinate system using geom_polygon wedges
  - 'Clean layered composition: gridlines → spokes → wedges → labels'
  - Proper compass angle convention (N=0°, clockwise) correctly converted to Cartesian
    coordinates
  - Appropriate use of 1:1 aspect ratio for circular visualization
  - Professional appearance with subtle gridlines and balanced colors
  weaknesses:
  - Figure size is 12x12 instead of the recommended 16x9 landscape (though square
    is acceptable for polar plots)
  - Missing frequency unit in title or labels (e.g., days or %)
  image_description: The plot displays a polar bar chart (wind rose) with 8 compass
    direction wedges radiating from the center. The wedges alternate between Python
    Blue (#306998) and Yellow (#FFD43B) colors. Compass directions (N, NE, E, SE,
    S, SW, W, NW) are labeled around the perimeter in bold text. Concentric dashed
    circular gridlines at intervals of 5, 10, 15, and 20 are visible with frequency
    labels (5, 10, 15, 20) positioned along the NNE axis. The SW direction has the
    longest wedge (frequency ~22), followed by S (~18), N (~15), and E (~12). The
    title "Wind Direction Frequency · polar-bar · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. The plot uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio with clean white background and
    subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Creative use of geom_polygon to construct polar wedges, geom_path
          for gridlines, geom_segment for spokes, geom_text for labels. Demonstrates
          plotnine's layered grammar of graphics approach. Since plotnine lacks native
          coord_polar(), the manual Cartesian-to-polar transformation is an impressive
          workaround that stays within the library.
  verdict: APPROVED
