review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of iris dataset providing real-world biological context for hierarchical
    clustering
  - Clear hierarchical structure showing species relationships (Setosa distinct from
    Versicolor/Virginica)
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid, despine, colorblind palette)
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what the colors represent (species clusters vs distance threshold)
  - 'Sample labels are confusing: Seto 9 does not clearly indicate species membership;
    should use clearer format like Setosa-1'
  - Seaborn is only used for styling, not for actual plotting (scipy.dendrogram does
    the work) - consider using sns.clustermap if appropriate
  - 'Minor: x-axis label font could be slightly larger for better readability with
    30 items'
