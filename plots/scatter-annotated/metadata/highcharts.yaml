review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of Highcharts dataLabels with allowOverlap: false to prevent label
    collisions'
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color choice and transparency
  - 'Good text outline (textOutline: 3px white) ensures label readability over grid
    lines'
  - Realistic tech company business context that demonstrates the annotation use case
    well
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Uses raw JSON dict configuration instead of highcharts-core Python classes as
    shown in library rules
  - Grid lines could be slightly more visible (alpha 0.15 is quite faint)
  - Some labels could benefit from smart positioning (e.g., labels near axis edges
    like DataFlow appear slightly cramped)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with 15 data points representing
    tech companies. Each point is a semi-transparent blue circle (rgba blue ~#306998
    with alpha 0.7) with company name labels positioned above each point. The title
    "scatter-annotated · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The
    X-axis shows "Annual Revenue ($ millions)" ranging from 0 to 500+, and the Y-axis
    shows "Year-over-Year Growth (%)" ranging from approximately -14 to 96. Companies
    like PrimeData (high growth ~89%), SyncLabs (~67%), and QuantumIO (negative growth
    ~-8%) are clearly labeled. The background is white with subtle gray grid lines.
    Labels have white text outlines for readability.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are clearly readable. Data labels
          are legible with good text outline. Slightly smaller than optimal for 4800px
          canvas.

        comment: Markers are well-sized (radius 20) with good alpha (0.7). Could be
          slightly larger for this data density (15 points).

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.15). Legend disabled which is appropriate
          for single series, but grid could be slightly more visible.

        comment: Uses Highcharts dataLabels feature for annotations with text outline.
          Could leverage more Highcharts-specific features like hover tooltips configuration
          or animation settings.
