review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of directed network graph using Altair's declarative
    approach with layered charts
  - Smart hierarchical layout algorithm that positions nodes based on dependency depth
  - Clean arrow implementation using triangular points with angle encoding
  - Good color scheme with distinct colors for each module type
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (fontSize=14) could be slightly larger (16-18) for better legibility
    at full resolution
  - Data does not include bidirectional edges to demonstrate curved edge handling
