review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using pygal XY chart as SVG canvas for word cloud rendering
  - Well-implemented spiral placement algorithm that fills 16:9 canvas effectively
  - Excellent color palette using pyplots brand colors with colorblind-safe contrast
  - Tech buzzwords provide realistic relatable context for demonstration
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles despite custom placement logic
  - Outputs multiple formats (PNG, SVG, HTML) for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Data and Machine words positioned very close together nearly touching
  - Word distribution is slightly right-heavy with more whitespace on left side
  - Could include more words to demonstrate word cloud density better
  - Frequency range could be wider for more dramatic visual size differences
