review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and factor_cmap for color mapping by species
  - Clean 4x4 grid layout with histograms on diagonal and scatter plots off-diagonal
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal) with good contrast
  - Proper axis labels with units on all edges
  - Correct title format placement in top-left cell
  - Well-sized text for the 3600x3600 canvas (20pt axis labels, 16pt ticks)
  - Dashed grid lines at appropriate alpha for subtlety
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only visible in top-left histogram cell; could be more prominent or placed
    outside the grid
  - Output includes both PNG and HTML; while HTML is appropriate for Bokeh, it is
    extra output
  image_description: 'The scatter matrix displays a 4×4 grid of plots comparing four
    Iris dataset variables: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal Length (cm),
    and Petal Width (cm). The diagonal cells show overlapping stacked histograms for
    three species distributions, while off-diagonal cells show scatter plots for each
    variable pair. Colors used are Python Blue (#306998) for Setosa, Python Yellow
    (#FFD43B) for Versicolor, and teal (#2AA198) for Virginica. The title "scatter-matrix
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top-left corner. A legend in the top-left
    histogram cell identifies the three species. Variable names with units appear
    along the left (y-axis) and bottom (x-axis) edges. Grid lines are subtle and dashed.
    All plots have consistent dark gray outlines.'
