review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visual representation of all four Bollinger Band components
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing and colors
  - SMA correctly rendered as dashed line per spec requirements
  - Appropriate data generation with realistic stock price movements
  - Proper 120-day trading period as specified
  - Legend placement at bottom keeps chart area clean
  weaknesses:
  - Fill is applied to baseline rather than between upper and lower bands (pygal limitation
    - acceptable workaround)
  - The fill-to-baseline approach creates visual clutter making bands harder to distinguish
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bollinger Bands indicator chart for 120
    trading days. The chart shows four distinct series: a dark blue "Close Price"
    line showing volatile price movements starting around $151 and trending down to
    around $137 by day 120, with significant fluctuations throughout. The "Upper Band"
    (light steel blue) and "Lower Band" (light blue/teal) create a volatility envelope
    around the price, both rendered with fill-to-baseline. The "SMA (20)" middle band
    is shown as a dashed yellow/gold line tracking the moving average. The title correctly
    displays "indicator-bollinger · pygal · pyplots.ai". X-axis shows "Trading Day"
    with labels at Day 1, 21, 41, 61, 81, and 101 (rotated 45°). Y-axis shows "Price
    (USD)" ranging from ~126 to ~164. Legend is positioned at bottom with colored
    squares for each series.'
