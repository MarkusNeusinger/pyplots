review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent storytelling with two annotations highlighting top seller and lowest
    performer, with color-coordinated arrows
  - 'Professional visual polish: custom background, 3-shade blue hierarchy, white
    bar edges, path effects on value labels'
  - 'Strong spec compliance: all specification recommendations addressed (consistent
    widths, value labels, strategic highlighting, spacing)'
  - Idiomatic matplotlib usage with bar_label, StrMethodFormatter, and patheffects
    — distinctive library features well leveraged
  weaknesses:
  - The Lowest — Books annotation placement (xytext at x-2.2, y*0.30) creates a long
    curved arrow that spans across unrelated bars, reducing clarity
  - Annotation positioning relies on several magic numbers tied to specific data values
    rather than relative positioning
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" with 6 product categories on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing,
    Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys) and Sales (USD) on the y-axis. Bars use a
    blue monochromatic palette: the tallest bar (Electronics, $45,200) is highlighted
    in dark navy blue with a "Top seller Electronics" annotation and arrow; the shortest
    bar (Books, $18,900) is in a lighter muted blue with a "Lowest — Books" annotation
    and curved arrow. The remaining bars (Clothing $32,800, Home & Garden $28,500,
    Sports $38,700, Toys $24,100) are in a standard medium blue (#306998). Dollar-formatted
    value labels appear above each bar with white stroke path effects for readability.
    The background is off-white (#FAFAFA), y-axis has subtle gridlines (alpha=0.15),
    and only the bottom spine is visible. Layout is clean with well-proportioned margins.'
