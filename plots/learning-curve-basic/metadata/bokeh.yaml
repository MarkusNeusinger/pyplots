review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with proper use of Bokeh's Band model for confidence intervals
  - Interactive HoverTool provides detailed information on hover (training vs validation,
    exact values, std range)
  - Good color scheme using Python's signature blue (#306998) and complementary orange
    (#E6A800)
  - Proper ColumnDataSource usage for both data series
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) preserves Bokeh's interactive capabilities
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in bottom-right corner could be moved closer to the curves (e.g.,
    top_left inside plot area would be near the training curve)
  - Text sizes, while adequate, are on the lower end for the 4800x2700 canvas
