quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended in spec
  - Data sorted by difference reveals patterns effectively (smallest to largest improvement)
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast (blue/yellow instead of red/green)
  - Clean, subtle connecting lines that do not overpower the dots
  - Appropriate dot sizing for the data density
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario with plausible score values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears partially cut off at the bottom right corner of the plot
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features (hover tooltips) in the HTML output
  - All improvements are positive; including one negative change would demonstrate
    the plot type full capability
