review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the fade effect using alpha gradients on segmented
    line data
  - Creative use of double-point highlight (yellow ring + red center) for the live
    data indicator
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color choices and subtle grid
  - Thoughtful annotations including LIVE indicator and older data direction marker
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with appropriate data characteristics (spikes,
    noise, trend)
  weaknesses:
  - panel_grid_major incorrectly uses element_text instead of element_line (this is
    a bug that likely causes warnings)
  - The intermediate marker points (every 10th point) could be slightly more prominent
