review:
  strengths:
  - Clear polynomial regression curve showing diminishing returns pattern
  - R² value displayed in legend for goodness of fit indication
  - Appropriate data context with plant growth vs sunlight exposure
  - Correct title format following pyplots convention
  - Good color contrast between data points (blue) and regression curve (red)
  weaknesses:
  - Polynomial equation not displayed on plot as suggested in spec
  - Data points lack transparency (alpha=0.7 mentioned in legend but not visually
    apparent)
  - Legend position at bottom creates slight visual imbalance
