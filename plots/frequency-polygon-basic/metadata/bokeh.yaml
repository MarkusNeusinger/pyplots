review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of frequency polygon with all spec requirements met
  - Clean, readable code with proper KISS structure
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper use of semi-transparent fills allowing distribution overlap visibility
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Lines properly extend to zero at both ends to close polygon shape
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows duplicate entries for each session (line and scatter are added separately
    with same legend_label)
  image_description: 'The plot displays three frequency polygons comparing test score
    distributions across three sessions. The Morning Session (Python blue, #306998)
    is centered around 65-70 with moderate spread. The Afternoon Session (yellow,
    #FFD43B) is centered around 75-80 with the widest spread, extending from about
    50 to 120. The Evening Session (teal, #17A589) shows a bimodal-like pattern centered
    around 50-60. Each polygon has semi-transparent fill beneath the lines, allowing
    overlapping distributions to be clearly visible. Circular markers are placed at
    bin midpoints. The legend is positioned in the top-left corner with a white background
    and border. Axes are clearly labeled with units: "Test Score (points)" and "Frequency
    (count)". Grid lines are subtle (dashed, alpha=0.3). The title follows the correct
    format: "frequency-polygon-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai".'
