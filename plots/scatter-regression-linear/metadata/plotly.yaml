review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of confidence interval band using polygon fill technique
  - Clear statistical annotations showing equation, R², and r values in a well-styled
    box
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Manual calculation of regression and CI demonstrates understanding
  - Good color contrast between scatter points (blue) and regression line (yellow)
  - Appropriate marker sizing and transparency for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use plotly express trendline features (px.scatter with trendline="ols")
    which would be more idiomatic
  - Legend positioned in lower-right could overlap with data in some scenarios
