review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Bland-Altman statistics with correct mean difference
    and LoA calculations
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors for bias line (yellow) vs limits of
    agreement (red)
  - Appropriate use of transparency and marker sizing for 80 data points
  - Annotations on the right side provide quick reference to exact values
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate units throughout
  - Zero reference line helps contextualize whether differences are clinically significant
  weaknesses:
  - 'Grid and legend styling could be refined (VQ-07: grid alpha could be lower, legend
    framealpha competes with data region)'
  - 'Library features (LF-01): Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like
    rugplot for marginal distributions or confidence intervals'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Bland-Altman agreement plot comparing two
    blood pressure measurement methods. Blue circular markers (n=80) with white edges
    and moderate transparency show individual paired observations. The x-axis displays
    "Mean of Two Methods (mmHg)" ranging from approximately 80-150 mmHg, and the y-axis
    shows "Difference (Method 1 - Method 2) (mmHg)" ranging from about -15 to +7 mmHg.
    A solid yellow horizontal line indicates the mean difference (bias) at -1.9 mmHg.
    Two red dashed horizontal lines mark the 95% limits of agreement at +7.1 and -10.9
    mmHg. A subtle gray dotted zero reference line is included. Numeric annotations
    appear on the right edge of the plot showing the exact values. The legend in the
    upper left displays the mean and LoA values with units. The title follows the
    required format: "bland-altman-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The layout is well-balanced
    with a subtle gray dashed grid.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot correctly, but the horizontal reference lines
          use matplotlib's axhline rather than seaborn-specific statistical annotation
          features
