review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with Python blue/yellow color scheme providing strong
    contrast
  - Box plots and strip points are well-separated visually while maintaining their
    relationship
  - Good jitter implementation prevents point overlap while keeping points associated
    with their categories
  - Data demonstrates multiple distribution characteristics (normal, tight spread,
    outliers, bimodal)
  - Correct title format and clear axis labels
  - Clean, linear code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Performance Score (%)" would be clearer)
  - Could use Plotly native boxpoints parameter instead of manually adding scatter
    traces for a more elegant solution
  - Grid alpha is perhaps too subtle, making it hard to read precise values
  image_description: The plot displays a box-and-strip combination chart with four
    categories (Method A, B, C, D) on the x-axis and "Performance Score" (ranging
    from ~25-95) on the y-axis. Each category has a blue-outlined box plot with light
    blue fill showing quartiles and median, with whiskers extending to show range.
    Yellow circular markers with blue outlines are overlaid on each box as jittered
    strip points, showing individual data values with transparency. The title "cat-box-strip
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The background is white with subtle
    horizontal gridlines. Method B shows higher, tighter scores; Method C shows lower
    scores with clear outliers extending down to ~25; Method D shows a wider spread
    suggesting bimodal distribution.

          but grid could be slightly more visible
