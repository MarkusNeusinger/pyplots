review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and properly sorted bars
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic programming language survey data that resonates with developers
  - Value labels positioned at bar ends enhance readability
  - Proper use of seaborn 0.14+ API with hue parameter to avoid warnings
  weaknesses:
  - Could highlight a specific bar (e.g., Python) to demonstrate the specification
    suggestion for drawing attention to specific categories
  - Uses seaborn primarily as a styling layer over matplotlib rather than leveraging
    seaborn statistical features
