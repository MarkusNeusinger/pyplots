review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required features (percentages, legend, distinct
    colors, exploded slice) are present and working
  - Thoughtful data storytelling with narrative legend names and on-slice annotations
    (#1 brand, Largest)
  - Creative use of pygal SVG node manipulation for slice explosion — a library-distinctive
    technique
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between all six slices
  - Realistic, neutral data scenario (smartphone market share) with accurate values
  weaknesses:
  - The trigonometric explosion calculation (~10 lines of math) is over-engineered
    — consider simplifying the approach or using a fixed translate offset
  - The exploded Others slice creates a visible gap that makes the pie chart feel
    off-center within the canvas
  - Legend text at the bottom appears somewhat small relative to the 3600px canvas
    despite explicit font sizing
  - The Largest annotation on the Others slice is generic — a more descriptive label
    would strengthen the storytelling
  - Smaller slices (OPPO at 8.7%, vivo at 7.5%) could benefit from slightly larger
    label text for better readability
  image_description: 'The plot is a 3600x3600 px pie chart on a white background.
    The title "Smartphone Market Share · pie-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top in dark text. Six slices represent smartphone brands: Apple (blue, 23.3%),
    Samsung (orange, 19.4%), Xiaomi (teal, 14.1%), OPPO (pink/rose, 8.7%), vivo (purple,
    7.5%), and Others (slate gray, 27.0%). The "Others" slice is exploded outward
    for emphasis via an SVG transform, creating a visible gap. White stroke borders
    separate each slice. Percentage labels appear in white text centered on each slice.
    The Apple slice carries a "#1 brand" annotation and the Others slice shows "Largest."
    A legend at the bottom is arranged in 3 columns with narrative names: "Apple (top
    brand)", "Samsung", "Xiaomi", "OPPO", "vivo", "Others (largest share)." The color
    palette uses saturated, high-contrast hues (blue, orange, teal, pink, purple,
    gray) that avoid red-green ambiguity.'
