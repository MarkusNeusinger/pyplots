review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimalist lollipop chart that perfectly matches the spec requirements
  - Excellent use of geom_segment + geom_point combination for the lollipop effect
  - Data sorted by value improves readability as recommended in spec
  - Well-chosen realistic business context (product category sales)
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  - Removed x-axis gridlines for cleaner look
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis gridlines could be more subtle (add alpha or lighter color)
  - Could demonstrate more lets-plot specific features like interactive tooltips
  image_description: The plot displays a basic lollipop chart showing product sales
    by category. Eight categories are shown on the x-axis (Beauty, Grocery, Toys,
    Books, Sports, Home & Garden, Clothing, Electronics), sorted in ascending order
    by sales value. Each data point consists of a thin blue vertical stem (#306998)
    extending from baseline 0 to a filled circular blue dot at the data value. The
    y-axis shows "Sales ($)" ranging from 0 to 50,000. Category labels are rotated
    45 degrees for readability. The title "lollipop-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The layout uses a minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines
    and no x-axis grid. Overall, the plot is clean, well-proportioned, and effectively
    communicates the ranking of categories by sales.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar (geom_segment, geom_point, theme_minimal), but
          could leverage more lets-plot specific features like tooltips or coordFlip
          for horizontal variant
  verdict: APPROVED
