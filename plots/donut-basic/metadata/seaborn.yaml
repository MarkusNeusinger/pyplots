review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of center space for total budget display
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate ring width
  - Percentage labels are bold white and highly readable inside segments
  - Category labels well-positioned outside the ring without overlap
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai standards
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with sensible departmental values
  - Square figure size appropriate for circular chart
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features (relies on matplotlib pie for the actual
    chart)
  - Could benefit from more extreme variation in segment sizes to better demonstrate
    donut chart capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart showing budget allocation across
    6 departments. The ring uses seaborn''s Set2 color palette with distinct pastel
    colors: orange for Engineering (28.1%), teal-green for Marketing (15.6%), yellow
    for R&D (17.5%), light green for HR (7.5%), pink for Sales (20.0%), and blue for
    Operations (11.2%). The center displays "Total $160,000" in bold dark text. Percentage
    labels appear in white bold text inside each segment. Category labels are positioned
    outside the ring. The title "donut-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. White edge separators divide the segments. The chart uses a square aspect
    ratio appropriate for circular visualizations.'

        comment: Uses seaborn's color_palette and set_theme, but donut chart is matplotlib-native;
          seaborn doesn't have a dedicated donut/pie function
  verdict: APPROVED
