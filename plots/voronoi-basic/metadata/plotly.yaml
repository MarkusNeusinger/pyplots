review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm for
    bounded regions
  - Clean separation of Voronoi cells with appropriate border styling
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with 20 distinct colors
  - Proper use of boundary points to ensure all regions are finite
  - Exports both PNG and interactive HTML formats leveraging Plotly capabilities
  - Square aspect ratio is perfect for spatial diagrams
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context (e.g., X Position (units) or descriptive
    domain-specific labels)
  - Could show a more realistic application scenario (e.g., store locations, sensor
    coverage)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Voronoi diagram with 20 seed points distributed
    across a 100×100 coordinate space. The plane is partitioned into distinct polygonal
    regions, each containing exactly one seed point. Regions are filled with a diverse
    color palette including blue (#306998), yellow (#FFD43B), teal, coral, lavender,
    pink, and various pastel shades. Each region has a dark gray (#333333) border
    with width 2, providing clear visual separation. The seed points are rendered
    as dark blue circles with white borders, positioned at approximately 18px size
    and clearly visible within their respective cells. The axes show X and Y Coordinate
    labels with ranges from 0-100. A subtle grid is visible with 0.1 opacity. A legend
    in the upper-left indicates "Seed Points". The title follows the correct format:
    "voronoi-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai". The plot uses a square aspect ratio (1200×1200
    rendered at scale=3 = 3600×3600 px) which is appropriate for a Voronoi diagram.'

        comment: Uses Plotly hover templates for interactivity; generates HTML export;
          uses fill=toself for polygons. Could leverage more Plotly features.
