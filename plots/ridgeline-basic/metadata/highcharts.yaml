review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme that smoothly transitions from cool winter blues to warm
    summer yellows/oranges, enhancing data interpretation
  - Proper implementation of ridgeline concept using Highcharts area series with threshold
    baselines for clean ridge separation
  - Realistic temperature distribution data that clearly demonstrates seasonal patterns
  - Gradient fills with transparency create visually appealing overlap effect
  - Clean y-axis labeling using JavaScript formatter to display month names at correct
    vertical positions
  - Produces both static PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Highcharts web
    capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (kde) which deviates slightly from KISS structure,
    though justified by library limitations
  - Grid lines extend fully across the plot area - could be more subtle or limited
    to below the ridges
  - Right margin appears slightly larger than necessary, creating minor layout asymmetry
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ridgeline visualization of monthly temperature
    distributions. The chart shows 12 partially overlapping density curves stacked
    vertically, one for each month from January (bottom) to December (top). The y-axis
    displays month names as labels. The x-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from
    -10 to 35. Colors transition from cool blue (winter months: January, February,
    December) through greens (spring/fall: March, October, November) to warm yellows
    and orange (summer months: May-September). Each density curve has a gradient fill
    that fades to transparent at the baseline. The title reads "Monthly Temperatures
    · ridgeline-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai". The layout uses a white background
    with subtle vertical grid lines. The distributions clearly show seasonal patterns
    - winter months peak around 2-8°C while summer months peak around 17-24°C.'

        score: 0
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1). Legend disabled as appropriate for this
          plot type since month labels are on y-axis. However, some grid lines extend
          through the entire plot area which slightly distracts.
