review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotBands to visually separate clusters with subtle colored backgrounds
  - Clear cluster annotations showing both cluster ID and average score
  - Proper use of plotLines for the average silhouette score reference line
  - Colorblind-safe color palette
  - Clean data generation with realistic silhouette score distributions using beta
    distributions
  - Good canvas utilization with the plot filling most of the available space
  - Proper sorting of samples within each cluster
  weaknesses:
  - The Average label for the red reference line is displayed vertically/rotated making
    it difficult to read - should be horizontal
  - X-axis title Silhouette Coefficient is not visible in the rendered output
  - No Highcharts-specific interactive features utilized (tooltips with sample details,
    hover effects, etc.)
  - All silhouette values are positive; spec mentions negative values indicate potential
    misclassification - data should include some negative examples
