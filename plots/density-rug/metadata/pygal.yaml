review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal data that effectively demonstrates both KDE smoothing and rug
    mark data transparency
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with scipy integration for KDE
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with fill to create density curve visualization
  - Proper font scaling for 4800x2700 canvas with custom Style
  - Colorblind-friendly color scheme with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Rug marks rendered as dots at y=0 rather than traditional vertical tick marks;
    while this is a pygal limitation, it reduces the visual impact of rug marks as
    specified
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive with context (e.g., Response Time ms instead
    of generic Value)
  image_description: The plot displays a density plot with rug marks on a white background.
    The KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) curve is shown in Python Blue (#306998) with
    a semi-transparent fill, revealing a clear bimodal distribution with peaks around
    35 and 65. The first mode (centered ~35) reaches approximately 0.78 on the normalized
    density scale, while the second mode (~65) reaches the maximum of 1.0. The rug
    marks are displayed as yellow/gold (#FFD43B) dots positioned along the x-axis
    at y=0, showing the actual data point locations. The title "density-rug · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Value" (ranging
    from ~10 to ~95), and the y-axis is labeled "Density (normalized)" (ranging from
    0 to 1.1). A legend at the bottom identifies "KDE Density Curve" and "Rug Marks".
    Subtle gray grid lines are visible in the background.
