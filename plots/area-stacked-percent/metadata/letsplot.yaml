review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors that are colorblind-friendly
  - Perfect 100% stacked area representation matching the spec exactly
  - Realistic and informative market share scenario that clearly shows composition
    changes over time
  - Clean ggplot2-style code structure using lets-plot grammar of graphics
  weaknesses:
  - Year labels display with comma separators (2,016 instead of 2016) which looks
    unnatural for year values
  - The HTML export setup_html() call is unnecessary overhead for PNG-only output
  image_description: 'The plot shows a 100% stacked area chart displaying market share
    evolution from 2016 to 2023 for four companies. The y-axis shows "Market Share
    (%)" ranging from 0% to 100%, and the x-axis shows "Year" from 2016 to 2023. Four
    colored areas are stacked: Company D (purple) at the bottom, Company C (green)
    above it, Company B (yellow) in the middle, and Company A (blue) at the top. The
    areas always sum to 100%. Company A (blue) shows clear growth over time (expanding
    from ~40% to ~58%), while Company B (yellow) declines. Companies C and D maintain
    relatively stable small shares. The title reads "area-stacked-percent · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai". The legend is positioned on the right side. The background is a
    subtle light gray (#FAFAFA) with light grid lines.'

        comment: Uses ggplot2-style grammar with geom_area, position="fill" for 100%
          stacking, scale_y_continuous with format for percentages. Could leverage
          more lets-plot specific features like tooltips for interactivity.
