review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of population pyramid using seaborn barplot with hue
    parameter
  - Perfect symmetric axis scaling with absolute value tick labels for easy comparison
  - Colorblind-safe blue/gold color scheme with high contrast
  - Clean data structure using pandas DataFrame with negative values for left-side
    bars
  - Well-placed legend and subtle grid lines enhance readability
  weaknesses:
  - None significant - this is publication-quality work
  image_description: The plot displays a population pyramid showing age distribution
    by gender. Blue bars (#306998) extend left from the center representing male population,
    while gold/yellow bars (#FFD43B) extend right representing female population.
    The Y-axis shows 9 age groups from "0-9" at top to "80+" at bottom. The X-axis
    shows "Population (thousands)" with symmetric scale from 6,000 on left to 6,000
    on right, with tick labels showing absolute values. A subtle black vertical line
    marks the center axis at 0. The title "pyramid-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is
    at the top, and a legend in the upper right identifies Male (blue) and Female
    (gold). Dashed grid lines aid readability.
