review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed set)
  - Good use of pygal Style for consistent visual appearance
  - Multiple event types with distinct colors (blue earnings, green dividend, purple
    split, red news)
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility and trend
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Events shown as simple dots instead of flag-style markers as spec requires
  - Missing vertical dashed connector lines from event markers to the price level
  - Event labels (e.g., Q4 Earnings Beat, Div $0.25) are not visible on the plot -
    only in tooltip
  - Event markers are relatively small and could be more prominent
  - Grid styling missing - no horizontal price guides visible despite show_y_guides=True
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price line chart over approximately
    180 trading days (January to August 2024). The main price line is blue, showing
    realistic stock price movement starting around $155, peaking near $163, declining
    to around $124, then recovering to $149. Event markers are shown as colored dots
    positioned above the price line at specific dates: blue dots for Earnings events
    (4 occurrences), green dots for Dividend events (3 occurrences), a purple dot
    for the Stock Split event, and a red dot for the News event. The title "stock-event-flags
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis shows trading dates (Jan 02 to
    Aug 13), Y-axis shows "Stock Price ($)" ranging from approximately $124 to $163.
    A legend at the bottom identifies the five series: Stock Price, Earnings, Dividend,
    Split, and News.'
