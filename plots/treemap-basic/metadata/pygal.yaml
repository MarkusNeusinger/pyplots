review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native Treemap chart type with proper hierarchical data
    structure
  - Good color palette with distinct, well-contrasted colors for each department
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Value formatter displays currency format ($XXK) which aids comprehension
  - Canvas is well-utilized with good proportions
  weaknesses:
  - Subcategory labels (R&D, Infrastructure, Digital, etc.) defined in data but not
    displayed on the rectangles - only values are shown
  - Colors could be more optimized for colorblind accessibility (current palette relies
    somewhat on hue differences)
