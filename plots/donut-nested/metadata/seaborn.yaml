review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme using seaborn light_palette() to create cohesive
    color families per region
  - Clean visual separation with white edges between segments
  - Well-organized dual legend system clearly distinguishing inner (regions) and outer
    (categories) rings
  - Center text effectively communicates total budget
  - Labels on inner ring include both region names and values for quick reference
  - Realistic business scenario (regional budget allocation) makes the visualization
    immediately understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is primarily used for styling/palettes rather than native plot functions
    (pie charts are matplotlib-native)
  - Inner ring labels at fontsize=13 could be slightly larger for better readability
    at full resolution
  - Category legend only shows blue shades which may cause slight confusion as each
    region has different color shades for the same categories
