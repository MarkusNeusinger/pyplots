review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using Python Blue (#306998) for bullish and
    warm amber (#E67E22) for bearish candles
  - Proper use of Highcharts Stock module which is designed for financial charts with
    native candlestick support
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with appropriate daily volatility and market behavior
  - Clean layout with well-proportioned margins and properly scaled text sizes for
    4800x2700
  - Correctly skips weekends in date generation for realistic trading day simulation
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that aid price level reading without being distracting
  weaknesses:
  - Grid line alpha (0.15) could be slightly higher for better price level readability

  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart titled "Stock Price Movement
    · candlestick-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai". The chart shows 30 trading days
    of OHLC data from October 1 to November 9, 2024. Bullish candles (close > open)
    are rendered in Python Blue (#306998), while bearish candles (close < open) are
    rendered in warm amber/orange (#E67E22). The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" ranging
    from $140 to $151 with $1 intervals. The X-axis displays dates in "Mon DD" format.
    Wicks are clearly visible with darker tones (dark blue for bullish, reddish-brown
    for bearish). The chart shows an initial decline from ~$150 to ~$142-143, followed
    by choppy trading and a slight recovery at the end. Grid lines are dashed and
    subtle. The layout is clean with good proportions.
  verdict: APPROVED
