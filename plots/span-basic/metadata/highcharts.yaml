review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of BOTH vertical and horizontal spans in a single plot
  - Real-world scenario (2008-2009 recession) makes the visualization immediately
    understandable
  - Perfect use of Highcharts plotBands feature with labeled regions
  - Semi-transparent fills (0.25 alpha) allow data to remain visible as spec requires
  - Clean intersection where spans overlap shows thoughtful data design
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis title "Date" is configured but not visible in the output (Highcharts behavior
    with categories)
  - Stock price values are somewhat generic; could reference a specific index for
    more realism
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing stock price data over
    time from January 2007 to October 2010. The title "span-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle "Stock Price with Recession
    Period Highlighted" below it. The y-axis is labeled "Stock Price ($)" ranging
    from 50 to 180. The x-axis shows quarterly dates from Jan 2007 to Oct 2010. A
    blue line with circular markers traces the stock price movement.


    Two span regions are clearly visible:

    1. A **vertical span** (light blue, ~25% opacity) highlighting the "Recession
    Period" from Jan 2008 to Jan 2009, with a label at the top

    2. A **horizontal span** (light yellow, ~25% opacity) highlighting the "Below
    Target Price" zone from $50 to $100, with a label on the left side


    The data shows the stock price declining from ~$155 peak in mid-2007 down to ~$78
    during the recession (Apr 2009), then recovering to ~$135 by Oct 2010. The overlapping
    spans create a visual intersection where both highlighted regions meet.'

        comment: Y-axis has unit "($)", but X-axis label is just "Date" (configured
