review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly Surface trace with contour projection to base plane
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent perceptual uniformity and colorblind accessibility
  - Good camera angle that reveals the 3D topology clearly
  - HTML export enables interactive rotation as specified
  - Clean minimal code structure
  - Proper title format exactly as specified
  weaknesses:
  - The seed is set but no random data is actually generated (seed is superfluous)
  - Contour lines on the surface could be more prominent for better visibility
  - Could utilize Plotly hover tooltips more effectively to show exact values
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D contour surface visualization with a blue-to-yellow
    Viridis colormap. The surface spans X and Y coordinates from -3 to 3, with height
    (z) values ranging from approximately -0.5 to 1.5. A prominent peak reaches ~1.5
    at coordinates around (1,1) shown in bright yellow, a secondary smaller peak exists
    near (-1,-1) in teal, and a valley (depression) appears near (-1,1) in dark purple/blue.
    White-highlighted contour lines are drawn on the surface itself, and contour projections
    are visible on the base (XY) plane at z≈-0.5. The title "contour-3d · plotly ·
    pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in blue. Axis labels read "X Coordinate",
    "Y Coordinate", and "Height (z)". A vertical colorbar on the right indicates the
    height scale with "Height (z)" label. The 3D scene has light gray background panels
    with subtle grid lines. The camera angle provides a good view of the surface topology
    from a 45-degree elevated perspective.
