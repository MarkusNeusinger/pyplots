review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data context using human heights with proper statistical parameters
    (mean=170, sd=10)
  - Clean KISS code structure following all guidelines
  - Proper use of quad glyphs for histogram bars with no gaps between bins
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Good visual styling with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Y-axis correctly starts at zero as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool to display bin range and count on hover, leveraging Bokeh
    interactivity
  - Data shows only a perfect normal distribution; adding slight skewness or a few
    outliers would better demonstrate histogram capabilities
