review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent elbow visualization with clear annotation of optimal k=4
  - Well-designed layered chart combining line, points, and highlighted elbow marker
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with separate chart layers
  - Appropriate color scheme with Python-themed blue and contrasting yellow highlight
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional context on hover
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - No legend present to explain what the line/points represent
  - Y-axis label could note that inertia is unitless or define the metric more explicitly
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering with
    a blue line connecting data points from k=1 to k=11. The x-axis shows "Number
    of Clusters (k)" and the y-axis shows "Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)"
    ranging from 0 to 6,000. Blue circular markers (filled) are placed at each k value.
    The elbow point at k=4 is highlighted with a larger yellow/gold marker with a
    blue border, and annotated with "Optimal k = 4" text in blue. The title reads
    "elbow-curve · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top. The curve shows the characteristic
    sharp initial decline followed by diminishing returns - a classic elbow shape.
    The background is white with subtle gray gridlines.
