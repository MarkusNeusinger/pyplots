review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept with 3 radial axes at 120° separation
  - Software module dependency network is a perfect real-world use case for hive plots
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for node data organization
  - Bezier curves for edges create smooth, visually appealing connections
  - Color-coded axes and edges by category (Core=blue, Utility=yellow, Interface=green)
  - Node size encoding by degree is implemented in the code
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (main, data, config, etc.) are not visible in the rendered PNG despite
    being in the code
  - Size legend (showing degree scale) is not visible in the output despite code for
    it
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - significant empty space in corners
  - Nodes appear relatively small for the 3600x3600 canvas size
