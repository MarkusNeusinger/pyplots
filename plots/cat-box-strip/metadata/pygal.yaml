review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using XY chart to achieve box plot with strip overlay
    (pygal.Box does not support strip overlay natively)
  - Well-designed color scheme with matching box and point colors for each category
  - Good use of custom Style for proper font sizing at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Clear statistical visualization with median, quartiles, whiskers, and caps properly
    constructed
  - Jitter and transparency on strip points effectively reduce overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Grid only shows on y-axis, no x-axis guides (minor visual consistency issue)
  - Some strip points in dense areas still overlap slightly despite jitter
  image_description: 'The plot displays a box plot with strip overlay showing plant
    height (cm) across four light conditions: Full Sun (blue), Partial Shade (yellow),
    Full Shade (green), and Artificial (orange). Each category shows a filled rectangular
    box representing the IQR (Q1-Q3) with a darker median line inside. Vertical whiskers
    extend from the boxes to caps indicating the data range. Individual data points
    are overlaid on each box with slight horizontal jitter, using matching colors
    with transparency. The title "cat-box-strip · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The x-axis is labeled "Light Condition" and y-axis is labeled "Plant Height
    (cm)" with values ranging from 0 to 80. The layout is clean with subtle horizontal
    grid lines on a white background.'

          grid is y-axis only which is fine
