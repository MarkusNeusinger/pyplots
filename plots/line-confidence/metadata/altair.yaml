review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with clear data generation logic
  - Confidence band appropriately widens over time showing realistic forecast uncertainty
    behavior
  - Uses Altair layered chart composition effectively (band + line + points)
  - Interactive HTML export includes useful tooltips for exploration
  - Consistent color scheme with good contrast between line and band
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered PNG despite code attempting to create one
    using resolve_legend - this violates spec requirement for legend that clearly
    identifies both the central line and confidence band
  - Y-axis starts at 0 but data ranges ~90-180, wasting nearly half the vertical canvas
    space (the code calculates y_domain but Altair appears to ignore it or it is not
    applied correctly to all layers)
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with a confidence interval on
    a white background. A dark navy blue line (#306998) shows the predicted mean values,
    surrounded by a light blue semi-transparent band representing the 95% confidence
    interval. The x-axis is labeled "Day" (ranging 0-50) and the y-axis is labeled
    "Predicted Value" (ranging 0-200). The title "line-confidence · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. The confidence band appropriately widens as time progresses,
    simulating forecast uncertainty. Point markers are visible along the line. However,
    **no legend is visible** in the rendered image despite the code attempting to
    create one. The y-axis starts at 0 creating significant whitespace below the data
    (which ranges ~90-180).

        comment: The resolve_legend approach with transform_calculate is complex but
          the legend doesn't render properly. Interactive HTML version with tooltips
          is good, but the static PNG which is the primary output lacks the legend.
  verdict: APPROVED
