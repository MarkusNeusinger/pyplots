review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn's native barplot with hue parameter for clean grouped
    bars
  - Clear, realistic business data scenario with meaningful quarterly growth patterns
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper left partially overlaps with Q1 bars; consider placing
    outside plot or in upper right
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped bar chart showing quarterly sales
    data (Q1-Q4) for three product lines: Electronics (dark blue), Clothing (golden
    yellow), and Home & Garden (teal). Each quarter has three bars side-by-side. The
    y-axis shows "Sales (thousands $)" ranging from 0 to 400, and the x-axis shows
    quarters. There''s a clear upward trend for Electronics sales across quarters
    (245→280→310→395). The title "bar-grouped · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. A legend titled "Product Line" is positioned in the upper left corner.
    Subtle dashed horizontal grid lines appear in the background.'
