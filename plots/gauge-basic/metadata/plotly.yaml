review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native gauge indicator (go.Indicator) with proper mode=gauge+number
  - Clean implementation of threshold-based color zones (red/yellow/green) matching
    spec exactly
  - Prominent value display with large font size (72pt) for immediate readability
  - Proper title format with spec-id and attribution in subtitle
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive use
  - Professional color scheme using Python blue (#306998) for indicator and borders
  weaknesses:
  - Red/yellow/green color scheme may not be fully accessible to colorblind users;
    consider adding patterns or alternative color palette
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart showing "Sales
    Target Achievement" with a prominent "72%" value displayed in the center. The
    gauge has three color zones: red (0-30%), yellow (30-70%), and green (70-100%),
    following the intuitive red=bad, yellow=caution, green=good convention. A dark
    blue (Python blue #306998) bar indicates the current value position at 72%, placing
    it just into the green zone. Tick marks appear at 10% intervals (0%, 10%, 20%...
    100%) around the arc with percentage labels. The title "Sales Target Achievement"
    appears at the top with the subtitle "gauge-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" below
    it. The overall layout is clean with a white background and good use of canvas
    space.'

        comment: Uses Plotly's `go.Indicator` with gauge mode, threshold marker, and
          HTML export for interactivity; could leverage more interactive features
          like hover tooltips
  verdict: APPROVED
