review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution using 2D projection to simulate 3D wireframe in Bokeh which
    lacks native 3D support
  - Clean wireframe rendering with appropriate line width and alpha transparency
  - Custom 3D axis system with arrows adds clarity to the visualization
  - Correct title format and good canvas utilization
  - Python Blue color provides good visibility against light background
  weaknesses:
  - Formula annotation (z = sin(sqrt(x² + y²))) not visible in the rendered image
  - Axis tick marks not present as specified in requirements
  - X and Y axis labels positioned at edges are relatively small compared to wireframe
