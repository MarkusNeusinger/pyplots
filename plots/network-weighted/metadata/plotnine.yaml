review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code with good structure following KISS principles
  - Effective use of weighted degree for node sizing (sum of connected edge weights)
  - Good legend explaining the weight scale with appropriate breaks
  - Realistic trade network data with recognizable country relationships
  - Proper use of theme_void() for network visualization
  - Edge thickness clearly distinguishes strong vs weak trade relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" but uses "International
    Trade Network" as prefix instead of just spec-id
  - Node labels could be larger for better legibility at full resolution
  - plotnine is not designed for network visualizations - this is essentially a workaround
    using segments/points
  - Some node-label overlap could be improved with better nudge_y values or smarter
    positioning
  image_description: The plot displays a weighted network graph representing international
    trade between 12 countries (USA, China, Germany, Japan, UK, France, Canada, Mexico,
    S.Korea, India, Brazil, Australia). Nodes are arranged in a roughly circular layout
    with yellow-filled circles with dark borders. Country labels appear in bold black
    text above each node. Edges are rendered as blue lines (#306998) with varying
    thickness representing trade volume in billions USD. The thickest edges connect
    USA-Canada, USA-Mexico, and USA-China, clearly showing the largest trade relationships.
    A legend on the right shows "Trade Volume (Billions USD)" with three reference
    sizes (100, 300, 500). The title "International Trade Network · network-weighted
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle explaining the edge
    thickness meaning. The background is clean white with no axes (theme_void applied).

        comment: plotnine does NOT support network visualizations per library rules.
          This uses basic geom_segment and geom_point as a workaround.
