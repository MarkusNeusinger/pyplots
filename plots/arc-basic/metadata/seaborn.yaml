review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with clear node labels and well-proportioned arcs
  - Arc height correctly proportional to node distance as specified
  - Weight-based arc thickness adds meaningful information dimension
  - Good use of transparency (alpha=0.6) for overlapping arcs
  - Realistic character interaction scenario demonstrates practical use case
  - Clean title format and well-placed legend
  weaknesses:
  - Residual x and y axis labels still visible on the plot - need to call ax.set_xlabel
    and ax.set_ylabel to remove them completely
  - Minimal use of seaborn-specific features - primarily matplotlib with seaborn styling
    only
