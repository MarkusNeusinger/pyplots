review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair layered composition with separate marks for bars, error
    lines, and caps
  - Clear annotation explaining what error bars represent (±1 SD) as required by spec
  - Realistic scientific context with treatment comparison data
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with appropriate font sizes
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - No tooltips for interactivity - Altair strength is interactive visualization
  - Only symmetric error bars shown; asymmetric example would demonstrate fuller feature
    coverage
