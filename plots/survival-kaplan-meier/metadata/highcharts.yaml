  strengths:
  - Inline Kaplan-Meier calculation with Greenwood formula for CI (KISS principle
    followed)
  - Excellent colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with good contrast
  - 'Proper step function implementation using Highcharts step: left option'
  - Confidence interval bands correctly implemented with AreaRangeSeries and appropriate
    transparency
  - Censored observation markers now visible as diamond shapes on the curves
  - Realistic clinical trial data with meaningful difference between treatment groups
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in middle-left area potentially overlapping with data visualization
    region
  - Censored markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at the high resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis comparing
    two treatment groups in a clinical trial. The title "survival-kaplan-meier · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top with a subtitle "Clinical Trial:
    Survival Probability Over Time". Two step-function curves are shown: a blue line
    for "Standard Treatment" and a yellow/gold line for "New Treatment". Each curve
    has semi-transparent confidence interval bands (light blue and light yellow respectively).
    The Y-axis shows "Survival Probability" ranging from 0 to 1, and the X-axis shows
    "Time (Months)" from 0 to 36. The New Treatment (yellow) shows better survival
    probability over time compared to Standard Treatment (blue). Small diamond-shaped
    censored observation markers are visible on the curves. The legend is positioned
    on the left side of the plot. Grid lines are subtle dashed lines.'

        comment: Uses LineSeries with step, AreaRangeSeries for CI bands, ScatterSeries
          for censored marks; good use of Highcharts features but could leverage more
          interactive features like tooltips with survival data
  verdict: APPROVED
