quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of a Data Matrix barcode with correct L-shaped
    finder pattern
  - Clean implementation hiding axes and grid for authentic barcode appearance
  - Good use of Highcharts heatmap module with proper color axis configuration
  - Proper quiet zone margin around the barcode
  - Realistic example data (serial number encoding)
  - Correct title format and clear subtitle explaining encoded content
  weaknesses:
  - Interior data is random rather than actual ECC 200 encoding (acceptable for visualization
    demo)
  - Path import used only for temp file cleanup (minor)
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 18x18 Data Matrix 2D barcode rendered as
    a heatmap visualization. The title "datamatrix-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in bold black text, followed by a subtitle showing "Data Matrix
    Encoding: \"SERIAL:12345678\"" in gray. The barcode itself consists of a square
    grid of black and white cells on a white background. The L-shaped finder pattern
    is correctly implemented with a solid black column on the left edge and a solid
    black row on the bottom edge. The alternating (clock) timing patterns are visible
    on the top and right edges. The interior cells contain a pseudo-random pattern
    simulating encoded data. The matrix is well-centered with adequate quiet zone
    (white border) around it. No axes or grid lines are visible, giving it a clean
    barcode appearance.'
