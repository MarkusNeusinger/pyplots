review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Radar chart as polar-like visualization for cyclical data
  - Clean, well-structured code with appropriate custom styling for high-resolution
    output
  - Realistic hourly temperature data that demonstrates the value of polar visualization
  - Good use of square canvas (3600x3600) which is ideal for radial charts
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Filled area with appropriate opacity makes the pattern easily visible
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis labels (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) are on the small side relative to the canvas
  - Grid shows y-guides but could benefit from more prominent radial ring labels
  - Does not utilize pygal interactive tooltip features which are a distinctive library
    strength
  image_description: The plot shows a radar/polar chart with 24 spokes representing
    hours (00:00 to 23:00) arranged clockwise around a circular axis. The radial axis
    shows temperature values from 0 to approximately 20°C with gridlines at 4, 8,
    12, 16, and 20. The data is displayed as a filled polygon in a light blue color
    (#306998 with opacity) connecting 24 data points representing hourly temperatures.
    The polygon shows a clear daily temperature cycle with lower values in early morning
    hours (around 00:00-06:00) and peak values around midday (11:00-14:00). The title
    "Hourly Temperature (°C) · polar-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    All hour labels are clearly readable around the perimeter, and radial gridlines
    are visible but subtle.
