quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of KDE algorithm using Scott's rule for bandwidth selection
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate stroke width and fill for the density
    curve
  - Well-chosen realistic data scenario (test scores) that demonstrates distribution
    characteristics
  - Proper use of pygal's XY chart type for continuous density visualization
  - Good font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas dimensions
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Test Score (points) or Density (probability))
  - Font sizes deviate significantly from library template guidelines (72 vs recommended
    28 for title)
  - Does not include optional rug plot mentioned in spec notes (would enhance the
    visualization)
