review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for perceptually uniform color representation
  - Realistic market research scenario with plausible customer data
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good bin resolution (25x25) that reveals density patterns clearly
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage lets-plot distinctive interactive features (could have used
    tooltips or hover info)
  - Grid/legend styling could be refined - legend appears somewhat distant from main
    plot area
  image_description: The plot displays a 2D histogram heatmap showing the joint distribution
    of Customer Age (years) on the x-axis and Annual Spending ($k) on the y-axis.
    The visualization uses a viridis colormap with colors ranging from dark purple
    (low counts) through blue and teal to bright yellow/green (high counts around
    20). The data shows a clear elliptical density pattern centered approximately
    at age 42 and spending $55k, demonstrating positive correlation between age and
    spending. The colorbar on the right shows "Count" ranging from about 5 to 20.
    The title "histogram-2d · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot
    uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines.
