review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of the spec for a library without animation support -
    small multiples effectively convey progressive reveal
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate Python blue (#306998) and contrasting
    yellow highlight
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Effective use of facet_wrap to show 4 stages of progression
  - Current point highlighting clearly indicates the most recent point being drawn
    as specified
  - Realistic business data scenario with seasonal patterns
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are rotated 45 degrees which works but creates slight crowding
    in smaller facet panels
  - Legend at bottom takes vertical space; could potentially be integrated more elegantly
  - The direction of progression could be enhanced with a gradient effect on the line
    rather than just highlighting the endpoint
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples layout showing the progressive
    reveal of a line chart depicting monthly sales growth over 24 months. Each facet
    panel shows a different stage of completion: "6 Months" (top-left), "12 Months"
    (top-right), "18 Months" (bottom-left), and "24 Months (Complete)" (bottom-right).
    The line is rendered in a deep blue color (#306998) with small blue circular markers
    at each data point. A larger yellow/gold highlighted point (#FFD43B) marks the
    current (most recent) position in each panel, clearly indicating the progression
    point. The Y-axis displays "Monthly Sales (USD)" with values formatted as $50K,
    $60K, $70K. The X-axis shows "Time Period" with labels like "Jan ''23", "Jun ''23",
    "Jan ''24", "Jun ''24", "Dec ''24" rotated 45 degrees. The title "line-animated-progressive
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top with a subtitle "Progressive
    Line Reveal: Monthly Sales Growth Over Time". A legend at the bottom distinguishes
    "Historical" (blue) from "Current" (yellow) data points. The background is clean
    white with subtle gray grid lines.'

        comment: All text readable; title bold and large (22pt), axis labels 18pt,
          tick labels 14pt. Slightly below perfect due to x-axis tick rotation crowding

        comment: Line and points clearly visible. Historical points (size=3) appropriately
          small, current point (size=5) stands out. Points could be slightly larger
