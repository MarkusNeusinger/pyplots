review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent feature coverage showing positive, negative, and zero changes in the
    data
  - Clean horizontal dumbbell layout with proper sorting by improvement
  - Good color choice (Python Blue/Yellow) that is colorblind accessible
  - Subtle gray connecting lines that do not overpower the dots
  - Correct title format and proper axis labeling
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend markers at bottom are quite small, making it harder to see the color distinction
    in the legend itself
  - X-axis label could include units (e.g., Satisfaction Score (%))
  - Some unused whitespace at bottom of canvas below legend area
