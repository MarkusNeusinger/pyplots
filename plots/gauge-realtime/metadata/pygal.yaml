review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of pygal SolidGauge with half_pie mode for clean gauge visualization
  - Good demonstration of real-time concept through multiple time-point gauges (Current,
    t-1, t-2, t-3)
  - Clear color coding with intuitive warning (yellow) and critical (red) zones
  - Proper title format and comprehensive legend with status labels
  - Dual output (PNG and HTML) leveraging pygal interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function get_zone_info() which violates the KISS principle
    (no functions/classes)
  - The green/normal zone is not demonstrated in the visual output (all values are
    in warning or critical range)
  - 'Title contains extra information (Range: 0-100%) beyond the required format'
  image_description: 'The plot displays four half-pie solid gauges arranged in a 2x2
    grid on a white background. The title "gauge-realtime · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center. Each gauge shows a CPU usage value with the filled arc portion
    and percentage displayed both inside the arc and below it. The gauges show: Current:
    85% (coral/red), t-1: 82% (coral/red), t-2: 75% (yellow), t-3: 65% (yellow). The
    legend at the bottom lists all four time points with their values and status labels
    (Critical or Warning). The unfilled portion of each arc is light gray. All gauges
    use the half-pie style with inner radius creating a donut-like appearance.'
