review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggbunch API to create composite layout with aligned axes
  - Clean axis alignment between main scatter and marginal histograms using shared
    limits
  - Appropriate point transparency (alpha=0.65) revealing density patterns
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Well-structured code following KISS principle with clear section comments
  weaknesses:
  - Marginal histograms show y-axis tick labels that are somewhat small and could
    be more prominent
  - Main scatter plot title is in a separate ggbunch region rather than integrated;
    consider using labs(title=) on main_scatter
  - Could overlay KDE curves on histograms to better demonstrate bivariate distribution
    features
  - Right histogram y-axis text appears cramped near the edge
