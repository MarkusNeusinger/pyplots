review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of complex Smith chart geometry using Altair layers
  - Clean mathematical approach to constant resistance circles and reactance arcs
  - Good use of tooltips showing impedance values on hover
  - Proper impedance normalization and reflection coefficient calculation
  - Visually appealing color scheme with clear data visibility
  - Correct title format and informative subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap at 4.7 GHz and 6.0 GHz frequency annotations
  - Missing optional VSWR circles mentioned in spec notes
  - Could add more interactivity (zoom/pan or selection highlighting)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Smith chart with a circular blue boundary
    representing the unit circle (|Γ| = 1). Inside, gray constant resistance circles
    (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) and constant reactance arcs are drawn. The impedance locus
    is shown as a yellow curve with yellow circular markers, tracing an antenna impedance
    sweep from 1.0 GHz (left side, higher reflection) spiraling toward the center
    region (matched condition) at higher frequencies. Frequency labels appear at key
    points: 1.0 GHz, 2.2 GHz, 3.4 GHz, 4.7 GHz, and 6.0 GHz. A cross marker indicates
    the center (Z = Z₀). Resistance values (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) are labeled along
    the horizontal axis. The title reads "smith-chart-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    with subtitle "Antenna Impedance Sweep (1-6 GHz, Z₀ = 50Ω)".'
