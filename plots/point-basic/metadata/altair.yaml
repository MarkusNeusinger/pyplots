review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of layered Altair chart combining points, rules, and
    tick marks for caps
  - Clean reference line implementation using separate DataFrame
  - Proper use of Altair declarative encoding system with explicit type annotations
    (:Q, :N)
  - Good use of tooltips for interactivity
  - Appropriate horizontal orientation for categorical labels as spec recommends
  - High-quality visual output with proper sizing (1600x900 with scale_factor=3.0)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Effect Size lacks units (could be Effect Size Cohens d or similar)
  - Library features underutilized - could add selection/highlighting for interactivity
  - The seed(42) call is unnecessary since no random data generation actually occurs
