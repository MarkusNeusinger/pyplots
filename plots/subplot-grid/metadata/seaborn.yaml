review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 2x2 grid layout with four distinct plot types (line, bar, histogram,
    scatter) demonstrating subplot versatility
  - Financial dashboard scenario with realistic stock data showing price trends, volume,
    returns distribution, and price-volume relationships
  - Strong seaborn usage with lineplot, histplot, and scatterplot functions plus matplotlib
    integration for hybrid approach
  - Good color coding with blue/yellow scheme for positive/negative returns and RdBu
    diverging palette for scatter plot
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed and logical data flow
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis date labels in top-left subplot could use rotation or fewer ticks for better
    readability
  - Volume bar chart uses matplotlib ax.bar instead of seaborn barplot - could leverage
    more seaborn-native functions
