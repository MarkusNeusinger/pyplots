review:
  strengths:
  - Correct slope chart implementation using pygal Line chart with two x-axis points
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of pygal Style class for customization
  - Realistic business scenario with product sales comparison
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Direction color coding (blue/orange) not applied correctly - each product has
    unique color instead of color by direction
  - Direction arrows in series names not rendered in legend
  - Missing endpoint labels for entity identification as required by spec
  - Legend positioned on left side instead of bottom as intended
