review:
  strengths:
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all required features (colorbar, viridis, gridsize)
    implemented correctly'
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly set
  - Clean Viridis color palette that is perceptually uniform and colorblind-safe
  - Three Gaussian clusters effectively demonstrate hexbin density visualization
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) providing both static and interactive versions
  weaknesses:
  - 'Library mastery is low: plotly used mostly as a rendering engine with manual
    hexbin computation, color interpolation, and SVG path construction instead of
    leveraging native density features'
  - Generic axis labels (X Value, Y Value) lack domain context
  - Manual Viridis interpolation adds unnecessary code complexity when plotly has
    built-in colorscale support
  - Some wasted horizontal canvas space due to 1:1 aspect ratio with 16:9 output
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning density visualization
    titled "hexbin-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. Hexagons are
    rendered using the Viridis colormap — dark purple for low counts, transitioning
    through teal and green to bright yellow for the highest counts (~90+). A vertical
    colorbar on the right is labeled "Count" with tick values from 0 to approximately
    95. The X axis spans roughly -12 to 13 (labeled "X Value") and the Y axis from
    about -4 to 8+ (labeled "Y Value"). Three distinct density clusters are visible:
    one centered near (-2, 4) with a bright yellow peak, one near (0, 0) with green/yellow
    peaks, and one near (3, 3) with teal/green peaks. The hexagons are pointy-top
    oriented, well-formed, with edges matching fill color for a clean appearance.
    The background is white (plotly_white template) with subtle gray gridlines. The
    1:1 aspect ratio creates some unused horizontal space at the left and right edges
    of the canvas.'
