review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color gradient implementation showing time progression along the route
  - Clear start (green circle) and end (red square) markers with labels as spec requires
  - Well-structured waypoint data with elevation and time attributes
  - Good use of Highcharts Maps series types (MapLineSeries, MapPointSeries)
  - Realistic Swiss Alps hiking scenario with appropriate coordinate ranges
  weaknesses:
  - Geographic basemap not rendering - the Switzerland topology is loaded but not
    visible behind the route (critical spec requirement)
  - Poor canvas utilization - route occupies only ~20-25% of vertical space with large
    empty areas
  - Legend does not explain the color gradient meaning (time progression from blue
    to red)
  - No direction arrows along path as spec suggests for indicating travel direction
  image_description: The plot displays a hiking trail route rendered as a continuous
    path across the canvas. The path uses a color gradient from dark blue (start,
    right side) through light blue, white/cream, peach, and orange tones to dark red
    (end, left side), effectively showing time progression over the 6-hour hike. A
    green circle with "START" label marks the beginning on the right, and a dark red
    square with "END" label marks the terminus on the left. Yellow circle markers
    appear at regular intervals along the path representing waypoints. The legend
    in the right portion shows "Route (colored by time)", "Start", and "End" entries.
    The title "Alpine Hiking Trail · map-route-path · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top with a descriptive subtitle. The Switzerland topographic basemap is
    NOT visible - only a white background appears behind the route, which is a significant
    deviation from the spec requirement for geographic context.
