review:
  strengths:
  - Correct use of pygal.Histogram with manually computed bins using numpy histogram
  - Excellent custom Style configuration with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Clean KISS code structure following pyplots conventions
  - Realistic exam score data with meaningful axis labels including units
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai pattern
  - Both HTML and PNG outputs generated as expected for pygal
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (currently dotted lines are visible but acceptable)
  - Does not customize pygal tooltips which is a distinctive feature
  - Histogram bars lack visible borders which would help distinguish adjacent bins
