review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the coefficient plot concept with clear visual distinction
    between significant and non-significant coefficients
  - Clean, publication-ready appearance with proper font sizing for the target resolution
  - Good use of Plotly annotation features for the null reference line
  - Realistic housing price regression context with varied coefficient values
  - Properly sorted by coefficient magnitude for easy comparison
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Plotly interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Could use Plotly built-in error_x parameter instead of manually drawing lines
    for CI bars, which would be more idiomatic
  - Left margin (200px) is quite generous; could be tightened slightly for better
    canvas utilization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot with 12 predictor
    variables from a housing price regression model. Variables are listed on the y-axis
    (from bottom to top: Distance to City Center, Crime Rate Index, Age, Property
    Tax Rate, Garage Spaces, Has Basement, Bedrooms, Has Pool, Bathrooms, Lot Size,
    School Rating, Square Footage). The x-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)"
    ranging from approximately -0.6 to 0.7. Each coefficient is represented by a point
    with horizontal error bars showing 95% confidence intervals. A dashed vertical
    line at x=0 marks the null hypothesis threshold, labeled "Null" at the top. Significant
    coefficients (those whose CI does not cross zero) are shown as filled blue circles
    (#306998), while non-significant coefficients are shown as open gray circles (#999999).
    The legend at the top clearly distinguishes "Significant (p < 0.05)" vs "Not Significant".
    The title follows the correct format: "coefficient-confidence · plotly · pyplots.ai".
    The plot has a clean white background with subtle gridlines.'

        comment: Uses Plotly graph_objects with custom hover templates and vline annotation.
          Generates both PNG and HTML for interactivity. Could better leverage Plotly's
          built-in error_x parameter in scatter traces
