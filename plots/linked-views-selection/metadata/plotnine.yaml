review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of linked views concept for a static library that lacks
    native interactivity
  - Clean visual design with consistent color scheme across all three views
  - Smart use of a selection threshold (x > 4.5) to simulate selection state
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics throughout
  - Good canvas utilization with logical panel arrangement
  - Colorblind-safe palette with high contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses PIL for compositing which adds complexity (though necessary for this
    layout)
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could specify X Value (units) if context was clearer)
  - Data context is generic cluster data rather than a specific real-world scenario
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a multi-view dashboard with 3 coordinated visualizations demonstrating linked selection. The main title reads "linked-views-selection · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Selection: x > 4.5 highlights 58/150 points across all views".

    View 1 (Top-left): A scatter plot titled "Scatter Plot (X vs Y)" showing points in blue (selected) and gray (unselected) with a dashed yellow vertical line at x=4.5 marking the selection threshold. Points to the right of this line are highlighted in blue.

    View 2 (Top-right): A histogram titled "Value Distribution" showing the distribution of a numeric variable, with bars stacked by selection state (blue for selected, gray for unselected with overlap at alpha=0.75).

    View 3 (Bottom-center): A grouped bar chart titled "Category Breakdown" showing counts for Cluster A, B, and C with dodged bars showing selected (blue) vs unselected (gray) counts. Cluster B shows almost all points selected, Cluster A shows all unselected, and Cluster C shows a mix.

    A shared legend at the bottom shows "Selected" (blue) and "Unselected" (gray) markers. The overall layout is clean with white backgrounds and subtle gray grid lines.
