review:
  strengths:
  - Visually appealing image with good viridis color scheme
  - Contour levels well-distributed showing surface structure
  - Title format is correct
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Implementation code does not match the generated image - axis labels,
    ranges, and data context are completely different'
  - 'Library violation: Seaborn only used for styling (sns.set_style), not for actual
    plotting - code uses matplotlib contour functions directly'
  - Generic axis labels (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) with no units or realistic context
  - Missing contour level labels as recommended in spec
