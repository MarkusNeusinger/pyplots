review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized text and well-spaced grouped violins
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with good contrast
  - Custom KDE-based violin shapes using patches demonstrate advanced Bokeh usage
  - Swarm point algorithm effectively places points within violin bounds
  - Clean KISS code structure with good reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears small relative to the large canvas size; could use larger glyph
    sizes
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool for tooltips on swarm
    points
  - Some unused loop variables (_grp_idx, _cat_idx) could be cleaner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped violin plot with swarm point overlay
    showing response times (ms) across three task types (Simple, Moderate, Complex)
    and two expertise levels (Novice in blue #306998 and Expert in yellow #FFD43B).
    Six violin shapes are arranged in pairs for each task type, with Novice violins
    positioned slightly left and Expert violins slightly right within each category.
    The violin shapes show the distribution density computed via KDE, with 50% alpha
    transparency. Individual data points are overlaid as small dots within each violin,
    matching the hue of their corresponding group. The violins clearly show that Novice
    users have higher response times than Experts across all task types, and that
    response times increase with task complexity. The title "violin-grouped-swarm
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. X-axis is labeled "Task Type"
    and Y-axis is labeled "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0-700. A legend on the
    right side shows Novice (blue) and Expert (yellow) labels. The grid is subtle
    with dashed lines and low alpha.'
