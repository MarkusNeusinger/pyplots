review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with realistic European energy mix showing diverse
    compositions (nuclear-heavy France vs coal-heavy Poland)
  - Smart percentage label placement only for segments >=8%, avoiding clutter
  - Good color contrast with white edge separators between segments
  - Proper normalization to 100% with clear visual communication
  - Title format correctly includes spec-id and library
  weaknesses:
  - No distinctive matplotlib features used (hatching, custom annotations, or advanced
    styling could enhance)
  - Legend frame adds slight visual weight that could be removed for cleaner look
