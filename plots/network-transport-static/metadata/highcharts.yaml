review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts annotations module for route labels with colored badges
  - Clear color-coding system distinguishing Express/Regional/Local routes
  - Proper offset handling for routes connecting same station pairs
  - Well-designed station markers with data labels positioned above
  - Creative use of Unicode triangle symbols for directional arrows
  weaknesses:
  - Route labels (16px font) are slightly small relative to the high-resolution canvas;
    could benefit from being 18-20px
  - Some directional arrow symbols appear slightly disconnected from their route lines
    at certain angles
  image_description: 'The plot displays a regional rail network visualization with
    12 stations represented as white circular nodes with blue borders, positioned
    according to geographic layout. Stations are labeled with names such as North
    Terminal, Central Station, Airport, University, etc. Routes are shown as colored
    lines connecting stations: Express (EX) routes in blue (#306998), Regional (RE)
    routes in yellow (#FFD43B), and Local (LC) routes in purple (#9467BD). Each route
    segment has a directional arrow indicator and a colored label badge showing the
    route ID and times (e.g., "RE 1 | 06:00 → 06:25"). The title reads "network-transport-static
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle showing "Regional Rail Network - 12
    Stations, 19 Routes" followed by a color-coded legend. The network has a hub-and-spoke
    pattern centered on Central Station with branches extending to peripheral stations
    like Airport, University, and Industrial Zone.'
