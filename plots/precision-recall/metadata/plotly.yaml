review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stepped line style (shape=hv) which accurately represents
    threshold-based changes
  - 'Comprehensive features: includes AP score, baseline reference, and iso-F1 curves
    as suggested in spec'
  - Clean, professional color scheme with good accessibility (blue/yellow instead
    of red/green)
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with realistic fraud detection
    scenario
  - Area fill under curve provides good visual representation of Average Precision
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only F1 = 0.2 for iso-F1 curves while 4 curves (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8)
    are visible - should either show all or use a different approach
  - No custom hover template to show threshold values or detailed information at each
    point on the curve
  - Plotlys distinctive interactivity could be better leveraged with click-to-select
    threshold functionality
