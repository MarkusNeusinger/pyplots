review:
  strengths:
  - Clean descending sort visualization with excellent visual hierarchy
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and categorical axis handling
  - Good text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with appropriate font sizes
  - Subtle grid styling with dashed lines and appropriate alpha
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - No value labels on bars (spec mentions value labels can improve readability)
  - Does not leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities (hover tooltips would enhance
    the plot)
  image_description: The plot displays a sorted bar chart with 10 vertical bars arranged
    in descending order from left to right. The bars are colored in a muted blue (#306998
    - Python blue) with darker blue outlines. The title "bar-sorted · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears in the top-left corner. The x-axis is labeled "Product" with category
    labels (Product A through Product J) rotated at a slight angle. The y-axis is
    labeled "Sales (Units)" with values ranging from 0 to approximately 450. The bars
    show a clear descending pattern from Product A (highest ~450) to Product J (lowest
    ~85). The background is clean white with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick labels are readable. Font sizes are
          appropriate for the 4800x2700 canvas, though title could be slightly larger.

        comment: Good use of canvas space. Plot fills adequate area, though there's
          slightly more whitespace on the right.

          not strictly needed for single-color bars).

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource properly, figure with categorical x_range,
          vbar method, and Bokeh-specific styling. Could leverage more interactive
          features or hover tools.
  verdict: APPROVED
