review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Gapminder-style visualization with realistic country development data
  - Proper use of Bokeh interactive widgets (Button, Slider) with CustomJS callbacks
    for animation
  - Clean implementation of play/pause functionality with proper interval management
  - Good colorblind-safe palette for regional differentiation
  - Appropriate bubble sizing based on population with good alpha transparency
  - Year label as large background text follows spec requirement
  - Both HTML (interactive) and PNG (static snapshot) outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in PNG export - only shown via HTML Div element which is
    not rendered in export_png()
  - Font sizes could be slightly larger for optimal readability at 4800x2700 canvas
