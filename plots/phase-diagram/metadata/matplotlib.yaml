review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of phase space dynamics with clear spiral convergence
    to equilibrium
  - Multiple trajectories from different initial conditions beautifully demonstrate
    the basin of attraction
  - Direction arrows effectively show time evolution as required by spec
  - Clean, publication-quality aesthetics with well-chosen color palette
  - Proper use of analytical solution ensures smooth, accurate trajectories
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Position x (m)" or "(arbitrary units)" would be
    clearer)
  - Legend fontsize (14) could be increased to 16 for consistency with tick labels
