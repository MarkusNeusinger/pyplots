review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation matching spec recommendation for readability
  - Clear reference line at null hypothesis with annotation
  - Well-sized markers (18) and error bars with visible caps (width=10)
  - Proper use of asymmetric error bars calculated from CI bounds
  - Clean clinical trial context that is realistic and neutral
  - Good font sizing hierarchy (title 32, labels 24, ticks 18-20)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in bottom-right could overlap with data; top-right or outside
    placement preferred
  - All treatment effects are positive; including one negative effect would better
    demonstrate full capability
  - Grid opacity at 0.1 is very subtle; 0.2-0.3 would improve readability
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate plot with 6 treatment
    groups (Control, Treatment A through Treatment E) arranged vertically on the y-axis.
    The x-axis shows "Effect Size (units)" ranging from approximately -1 to 5.5. Each
    group has a blue circular marker (#306998) representing the point estimate, with
    horizontal error bars extending to show the 95% confidence intervals. The error
    bars have visible caps at the endpoints. A dashed yellow/gold vertical reference
    line at x=0 is labeled "Null" at the top, representing the null hypothesis. The
    Control group is centered at 0, while all treatment groups show positive effects
    of varying magnitudes (Treatment D highest at ~4.2, Treatment C lowest at ~1.5).
    The legend "Estimate ± 95% CI" is positioned in the bottom right corner with a
    semi-transparent white background. The plot uses the plotly_white template with
    subtle gray gridlines.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.1), but legend placement in bottom-right
          corner is suboptimal for this horizontal layout - would be better positioned
          outside the plot area or top-right

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with error_x and add_vline which are standard Plotly
          features, but doesn't leverage Plotly's interactive capabilities in the
          static output (hover templates, annotations with arrows, etc.)
  verdict: APPROVED
