review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of asymmetric error bars with clear visual distinction
    between upper and lower bounds
  - Proper use of error bar caps (width=12) making the extent clearly visible
  - Well-chosen data that demonstrates both right-skewed and left-skewed distributions
  - Clean annotation explaining what the error bars represent, as required by the
    specification
  - Good font sizing throughout for the 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at very top-left corner feels slightly disconnected from the
    data
  - Could leverage Plotly hover templates to show exact upper/lower error values on
    hover
