review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation from scratch showing clear community
    clustering
  - Good use of Altair layered chart composition (edges + nodes + labels)
  - Effective degree-based node sizing that highlights well-connected individuals
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between communities
  - Proper tooltip integration for interactive exploration
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels at 12pt could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Some label overlap in densely connected areas (Noah/Mia/Olivia region)
  - Could leverage Altair interactive selection features for highlighting connected
    nodes
  image_description: 'The plot shows a social network graph with 20 nodes (people)
    connected by gray edges. Nodes are colored by community: blue (Group A - Alice,
    Bob, Carol, David, Eve), yellow (Group B - Frank, Grace, Henry, Ivy, Jack), green
    (Group C - Kate, Leo, Mia, Noah, Olivia), and coral/orange (Group D - Paul, Quinn,
    Ryan, Sara, Tom). The title reads "Social Network · network-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. A legend labeled "Communities" appears in the upper right showing
    the four group colors. Each node displays the person''s name as a label. The network
    shows clear community structure with clusters positioned via force-directed layout,
    and cross-group connections (bridges) visible between communities. Node sizes
    vary based on degree (number of connections).'
