review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using XY chart to implement ternary plot in pygal (which lacks
    native ternary support)
  - Excellent soil composition data representing realistic use case with diverse samples
  - Proper ternary-to-Cartesian coordinate transformation with correct formula
  - Grid lines at 20% intervals as specified with dashed styling
  - Tick marks implemented along all three edges
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  - Square 3600x3600 format appropriate for triangular plot
  weaknesses:
  - Vertex labels (SAND, SILT, CLAY) are not visible in the rendered plot - they were
    added as zero-size dot series but the labels do not appear
  - Legend is either outside the visible area or not rendering correctly - critical
    for understanding the plot
  - The workaround of using invisible data points for labels is not effective in pygal
    rendering
  - Need to use pygal annotation or custom SVG text capabilities to add vertex labels
    that actually render
