review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation of Chernoff faces using Altair mark_point with layered
    scatter points
  - Excellent color coding by species with colorblind-friendly palette
  - Well-organized grid layout with good canvas utilization
  - Feature mapping legend clearly explains variable-to-feature correspondence
  - Good use of Iris dataset as a classic multivariate example
  weaknesses:
  - Feature mapping text overlaps with Sample 9 label causing text collision
  - Does not leverage Altair distinctive features like interactivity or tooltips
  - Face feature variations could be more visually pronounced between samples
