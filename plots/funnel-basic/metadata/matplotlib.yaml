review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent trapezoid geometry calculation with proper width proportions relative
    to first stage value
  - Smart text color switching (white on dark backgrounds, black on light) for optimal
    readability
  - Clean use of matplotlib.patches.Polygon for custom shapes
  - Proper formatting with comma separators and percentage display
  - Follows KISS principle with straightforward linear code structure
  - Uses the exact example data from the specification
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage matplotlib's built-in horizontal bar functionality or other
    distinctive features that could simplify the code
  - Color palette uses similar blue shades for first two stages which reduces visual
    distinction
