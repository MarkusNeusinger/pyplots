review:
  strengths:
  - Clean three-panel layout effectively demonstrates hierarchical drilldown concept
  - Excellent breadcrumb navigation shown in panel titles (All > NA > USA)
  - Value labels clearly positioned above each bar
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette for accessibility
  - Realistic business data scenario with geographically nested hierarchy
  - Code is well-structured and reproducible
  weaknesses:
  - Different Y-axis scales across panels (0-1000, 0-600, 0-250) can mislead visual
    comparison of values
  - Click indicators (down arrows) inside bars are somewhat subtle and could be more
    prominent
  - No legend for the data series colors
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features beyond basic barplot
  image_description: 'The plot displays three side-by-side bar chart panels demonstrating
    a hierarchical drilldown visualization for company sales data. The left panel
    (Level 1) shows three regional bars: North America ($850M, blue), Europe ($620M,
    orange), and Asia Pacific ($530M, green). The middle panel (Level 2) drills into
    North America showing USA ($480M, teal), Canada ($220M, orange-red), and Mexico
    ($150M, light blue). The right panel (Level 3) drills into USA showing New York
    ($200M, blue), Los Angeles ($150M, green), and Chicago ($130M, salmon red). Each
    bar displays value labels above and white down-arrow indicators inside bars (except
    Level 3). Panel titles show breadcrumb navigation paths. A subtle dashed grid
    and white background provide clean visual separation. The main title "bar-drilldown
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.'
