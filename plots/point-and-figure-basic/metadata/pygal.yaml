quality_score: 68
review:
  strengths:
  - Correct P&F algorithm implementation with proper box size and 3-box reversal logic
  - Good data generation creating realistic stock price movement
  - Proper use of pygal custom Style for sizing
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Y-axis grid lines correctly aligned to box size intervals
  weaknesses:
  - X and O text symbols are not visible in the PNG output - only dots appear (the
    formatter approach does not render text in PNG)
  - Support and resistance trend lines are not visible in the rendered output despite
    being in the code
  - Green/red color scheme is not colorblind-safe despite code comments claiming otherwise
    (should use blue/orange consistently)
  - Legend does not show X and O symbols, only colored squares
  image_description: The plot displays a Point and Figure chart using pygal's XY chart.
    It shows 8 columns (0-7) with alternating green dots for X (Rising) columns and
    red/orange dots for O (Falling) columns. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from $82 to $110 with grid lines at $2 intervals matching the box size. The X-axis
    shows "Column (Reversal)" from 0 to 7. The title correctly reads "point-and-figure-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". A legend at the bottom identifies "X (Rising)" in green
    and "O (Falling)" in red. However, the actual X and O text symbols are NOT visible
    - only small dots appear at each data point. The support and resistance trend
    lines mentioned in the code are also not visible in the rendered output.
