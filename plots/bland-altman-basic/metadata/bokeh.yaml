review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all Bland-Altman components (bias line, limits of
    agreement, annotations)
  - Realistic blood pressure comparison scenario with appropriate data generation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (ColumnDataSource, Span, Label)
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  - Well-sized text elements appropriate for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left could be moved to avoid proximity to data points
    (consider top-right or outside plot)
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance interactivity and is a key Bokeh strength
  - Grid styling is good but legend could have cleaner integration
