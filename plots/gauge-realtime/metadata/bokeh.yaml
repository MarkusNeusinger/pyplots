review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear color-coded zones following intuitive green/yellow/red
    conventions
  - Motion trail effect creatively shows dynamic nature in static image as spec requested
  - Comprehensive implementation including both static PNG and interactive HTML with
    real-time animation
  - Good use of Bokeh-specific features (patches, ColumnDataSource, Labels)
  - Realistic CPU monitoring scenario with sensible thresholds
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (value_to_angle, create_arc_data) instead of inline code,
    violating KISS structure guidelines
  - Tick labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart representing CPU
    usage monitoring. The gauge has three color zones: green (0-50, "Normal"), yellow/orange
    (50-80, "Warning"), and red (80-100, "Critical"). The needle points to approximately
    67%, positioned in the yellow warning zone. A motion trail effect shows two faint
    ghost needles at lower positions (around 62 and 65) indicating recent value transitions.
    The current value "67%" is displayed prominently below the gauge in large dark
    text, with "Warning" status text in orange below it. Tick marks appear every 10
    units with major labels at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. Min (0%) and max (100%)
    labels appear at the bottom corners. A subtitle reads "Live CPU Usage (motion
    trail shows recent values)". The title "CPU Monitor · gauge-realtime · bokeh ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The background is light gray (#f5f5f5).'
