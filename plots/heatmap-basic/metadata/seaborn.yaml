review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of diverging RdBu colormap centered at 50, making it easy to distinguish
    above/below average performance
  - Data patterns are intentionally crafted to demonstrate heatmap capabilities (Sales
    strong first half, Engineering strong second half, Finance consistently stable,
    HR mid-year dip)
  - Cell annotations with appropriate font size (16pt) make exact values readable
    without cluttering
  - Square figure format (12×12) is perfect for this 7×12 matrix, allowing cells to
    be nearly square
  - White gridlines with linewidth=1 provide clear cell separation without being distracting
  - Colorbar properly configured with shrink, label, and tick formatting
  weaknesses:
  - Could use sns.clustermap or add dendrograms to showcase seaborn clustering capabilities
    as mentioned in spec notes
  - Colorbar label is set twice (in cbar_kws and manually), which is redundant code
