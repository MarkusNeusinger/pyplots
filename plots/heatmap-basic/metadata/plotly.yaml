review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all four notes from the specification are implemented
    (diverging colormap, cell annotations, colorbar, logical ordering)
  - Strong Plotly idiom usage — zmid for diverging center, texttemplate with format
    specifiers, hovertemplate for interactive tooltips, xgap/ygap for cell separation
  - Realistic and engaging dataset with clear seasonal business patterns (summer outdoor/leisure,
    holiday gift categories)
  - All font sizes explicitly set at appropriate scales for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate complexity for data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Layout balance could be improved — colorbar creates right-side asymmetry and the
    plot area does not maximize canvas utilization
  - No subtitle or contextual annotation to guide the viewer toward the seasonal patterns
    — the story is there in the data but the viewer must discover it
  - Cell annotation text at 14pt is functional but could be slightly larger for easier
    reading at a glance
  image_description: 'The plot displays an 8x12 heatmap of monthly sales growth percentages
    across product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Food & Beverage, Books, Sports,
    Home & Garden, Beauty, Toys) and months (Jan-Dec). A diverging RdBu colorscale
    is used, centered at 0% — red/warm tones indicate positive growth and blue/cool
    tones indicate negative growth. Each cell is annotated with its numerical value
    including +/- signs. A vertical colorbar on the right is labeled "Sales Growth
    (%)" with percentage tick marks ranging from roughly -20% to +20%. The title reads
    "Monthly Sales Growth · heatmap-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top.
    White gaps separate the cells cleanly. Clear seasonal patterns are visible: summer
    months (Jun-Aug) show warm red tones for Sports, Home & Garden, and Toys; November-December
    show strong reds for Beauty, Books, Electronics, and Toys (holiday season). The
    layout uses a plotly_white template with a clean white background.'
