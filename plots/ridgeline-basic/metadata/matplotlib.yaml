review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with viridis colormap providing both aesthetic appeal
    and colorblind accessibility
  - Perfect implementation of the ridgeline concept with appropriate 60% overlap as
    specified
  - Realistic Northern Hemisphere temperature data showing clear seasonal patterns
    with appropriate variation
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with good comments
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Manual KDE implementation using list comprehension is less efficient than using
    scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (alpha=0.2 instead of 0.3)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a beautiful ridgeline visualization with 12
    overlapping density curves representing monthly temperature distributions. The
    months are arranged vertically from January at the top to December at the bottom.
    A viridis color gradient is used: purple/dark blue for cold winter months (January,
    February) transitioning through blue and teal to bright yellow-green for warmer
    months (July, August). Each ridge shows a smooth bell-shaped density distribution.
    Winter months peak around 0-5°C while summer months peak around 25°C, showing
    a realistic Northern Hemisphere seasonal pattern. The x-axis shows ''Temperature
    (°C)'' ranging from -10 to 40. Month names are clearly displayed as y-axis labels.
    The title ''ridgeline-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai'' is prominently displayed.
    The ridges have ~60% overlap creating the characteristic Joy Plot appearance.
    A subtle dashed grid appears on the x-axis only.'
