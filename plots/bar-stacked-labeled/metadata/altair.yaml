review:
  strengths:
  - Total labels are bold, well-positioned, and clearly formatted with dollar sign
    and K suffix
  - Clean declarative Altair code with proper encoding types (:N, :Q)
  - White stroke on bars provides excellent segment separation
  - Realistic business context with quarterly revenue data
  - Proper layer composition combining bars and text labels
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis quarter labels appear to have unusual styling (italic or rotation)
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (yellow-green adjacency)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart showing quarterly revenue
    by product category (Software, Hardware, Services). There are 4 bars representing
    Q1 through Q4, with each bar showing three stacked segments in distinct colors:
    blue for Software (top), yellow/gold for Hardware (bottom), and green for Services
    (middle). Total value labels are prominently displayed above each bar stack in
    bold black text with dollar sign and "K" suffix ($250K, $295K, $325K, $360K).
    The title "bar-stacked-labeled · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    The y-axis shows "Revenue ($K)" ranging from 0-400, and the x-axis shows "Quarter"
    with Q1-Q4 labels. A legend on the right identifies the three product categories
    with corresponding color squares. The grid is subtle with dashed lines. White
    stroke borders separate the stacked segments for clarity.'
