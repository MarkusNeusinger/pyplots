review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Chernoff faces with clear visual differentiation between
    car categories
  - 'Well-designed feature mapping: face width for efficiency, height for power, eye
    size for reliability, mouth curve for comfort creates intuitive visual patterns'
  - Clean, informative legends that explain both the category colors and feature mappings
  - Good use of square figure format (12x12) for the 3x3 grid layout
  - Category-specific data generation creates meaningful visual clusters (Economy=wide
    faces, Sports=tall faces, Luxury=happy faces)
  - Professional appearance with consistent styling (line widths, alpha values, edge
    colors)
  weaknesses:
  - Some wasted vertical space at the top of the figure above the first row of faces
    could be reduced
  - The within-category variation could be more pronounced to better demonstrate the
    multivariate nature of the visualization
  - Could potentially add more facial features (e.g., ear size, hair) to map additional
    variables as mentioned in the spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x3 grid of Chernoff faces representing
    car ratings. Each face is colored by category: blue for Economy (top row), yellow
    for Sports (middle row), and green for Luxury (bottom row). The faces have elliptical
    shapes with eyes containing white sclera and black pupils, eyebrows, a simple
    vertical nose with a base, and curved mouths. A category legend appears in the
    upper right corner, and a feature mapping legend in the bottom left explains the
    data-to-face mappings. Each face is labeled (Economy 1-3, Sports 1-3, Luxury 1-3).
    The title "Car Ratings · chernoff-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib.patches effectively for drawing faces, but this is
          a custom implementation rather than leveraging any specialized matplotlib
          features. The manual drawing with Ellipse, Circle, and plot is competent
          but basic.
  verdict: APPROVED
