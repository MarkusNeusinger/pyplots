review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of sparkline minimalism with proper removal of all chart
    chrome (axes, ticks, gridlines, legend)
  - Smart use of colored markers to highlight min (red), max (green), and first/last
    (blue) points
  - Perfect aspect ratio (4:1) achieved with figure_size=(16, 4)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Good use of plotnine theme system to strip away all unnecessary elements
  weaknesses:
  - Line could be slightly thinner for a more authentic sparkline appearance at very
    small sizes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a minimalist sparkline with a dark blue (#306998)
    continuous line on a clean white background. The title "sparkline-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in a readable font size. The line shows a
    clear trend: starting low-left with a blue dot (first point), dipping to a minimum
    marked with a red dot, rising to a peak marked with a green dot (maximum), then
    fluctuating before ending with a blue dot (last point). The aspect ratio is wide
    (4:1) as appropriate for sparklines. Critically, there are no axes, tick marks,
    gridlines, or legend visible - achieving the pure minimalist aesthetic required
    by the specification.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with geom_line, geom_point, theme customization,
          and scale_color_manual; could leverage more advanced plotnine features like
          stat transformations
  verdict: APPROVED
