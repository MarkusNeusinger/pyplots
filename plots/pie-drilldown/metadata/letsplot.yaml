review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot geom_pie with donut hole styling (hole=0.35)
  - Well-designed hierarchical data structure supporting multiple drill-down levels
  - Comprehensive interactive HTML with JavaScript drilldown and breadcrumb navigation
  - Colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color
  - Clean donut chart with appropriate sizing and white borders between slices
  weaknesses:
  - Percentage format string in layer_labels is broken - shows literal (.1f%) instead
    of formatted values like 45.0%
  - Lower portion of canvas has significant unused whitespace with chart positioned
    toward upper-left
  - Static PNG lacks breadcrumb navigation visible only in HTML version
