quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of bimodal distribution in Treatment B - clearly visible
    in the half-violin shape
  - Smart use of Plotly go.Violin with side=positive/negative to create the raincloud
    effect
  - Rich hover information showing detailed statistics (median, Q1-Q3, mean ± std)
  - Clean color palette that is colorblind-friendly
  - Proper use of transparency (opacity=0.6) for both cloud and rain points
  - All three raincloud components (cloud, box, rain) are clearly distinguishable
  - Realistic experimental data context with meaningful group differences
  weaknesses:
  - Legend header says Raincloud Components with generic labels but actual legend
    items show condition-specific names like Control (Cloud) which is confusing
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features
  - Implementation header has pre-filled quality score before actual review
