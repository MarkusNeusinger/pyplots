review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib stackplot with wiggle baseline to create authentic
    streamgraph appearance
  - Well-chosen color palette starting with Python blue/yellow, all colors visually
    harmonious and colorblind-safe
  - Realistic music streaming scenario with thoughtful trends (growing Hip-Hop, seasonal
    Electronic peaks in summer)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with appropriate font sizes for
    4800x2700 output
  - Smart removal of y-axis ticks emphasizing relative proportions rather than absolute
    values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the top stream area - could be positioned outside
    the plot or in a less intrusive location
  - X-axis label Month is minimal - could include the date range for context
  - Streams could show more dramatic variation to better demonstrate the visual power
    of streamgraphs
  image_description: 'The plot displays a streamgraph showing monthly streaming hours
    by music genre over two years (Jan''23 to Dec''24). Six colored stacked areas
    represent different genres: Pop (Python blue #306998), Rock (yellow #FFD43B),
    Hip-Hop (salmon/coral #E07A5F), Electronic (teal/mint #81B29A), Jazz (tan/beige
    #F2CC8F), and Classical (dark gray #3D405B). The streams are centered around an
    invisible baseline creating a symmetric, flowing river-like appearance. The x-axis
    shows months with quarterly labels, and the title "streamgraph-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. A legend in the upper-left
    corner identifies each genre. The y-axis ticks are intentionally removed for cleaner
    aesthetics.'
