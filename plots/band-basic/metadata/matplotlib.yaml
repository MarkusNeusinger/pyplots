review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of band plot with widening confidence interval demonstrating
    real-world forecasting behavior
  - Clean visual design with appropriate alpha values (0.3 for band, 0.7 for boundary
    lines)
  - Proper use of matplotlib fill_between for the band with clear central trend line
  - Good code structure following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Value is generic and lacks units - could be more descriptive like
    Measurement (units)
  - Data scenario is plausible but generic - could use a more concrete real-world
    context (e.g., stock price forecast, temperature prediction)
  image_description: The plot displays a band plot with a sinusoidal central trend
    line (dark blue, solid) oscillating between approximately 4 and 11 on the y-axis,
    with an overlaid semi-transparent light blue band representing the 95% confidence
    interval. The band visibly widens as x (time) increases from 0 to 10 seconds,
    demonstrating forecasting uncertainty that grows over time. Dashed boundary lines
    subtly mark the upper and lower bounds. The title reads "band-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" in a large font at the top. Axis labels show "Time (s)" on the x-axis
    and "Value" on the y-axis. A legend in the upper left identifies both the confidence
    interval band and mean trend line. A subtle grid with dashed lines provides reference.
