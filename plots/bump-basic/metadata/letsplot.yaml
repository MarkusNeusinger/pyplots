review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of direct labeling on the right side instead of legend, improving
    readability
  - Clean inverted Y-axis with rank 1 at top as specified
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with Python Blue (#306998) as primary color
  - Proper implementation of bump chart pattern with lines connecting same entity
    across periods
  - Well-sized elements (line width 2.5, point size 6) for clear visibility
  - Correct title format and output specifications (PNG at 4800x2700 via scale=3)
  weaknesses:
  - Right margin could be slightly wider to prevent labels from appearing too close
    to plot edge
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltip features in the HTML output
  - Data shows limited dramatic position changes - more crossovers would better demonstrate
    bump chart capabilities
