review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent physics-based circle packing algorithm with 350 iterations ensuring
    no overlap
  - Area-proportional sizing using sqrt scaling for accurate visual perception
  - Clean, colorblind-safe palette with logical grouping by department function
  - Smart label placement - only shows labels in circles large enough to fit them
  - Professional title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic department budget data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a color legend explaining the groupings (Tech, Support, Business, Compliance)
  - Some smaller bubbles (Legal, Security) are unlabeled and their departments are
    unclear without a legend
  - Customer Support bubble is not visible in the visualization
