review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, orange, teal) provides excellent accessibility
  - Clean legend placement at bottom with 3 columns showing experience levels clearly
  - Realistic employee performance data context with meaningful variation between
    groups
  - Proper use of box_mode=tukey for standard box plot whisker calculation
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis renders from 0 despite range=(35, 110) setting, creating excessive whitespace
    below the data
  - Outlier markers are very small dots that are difficult to see clearly
  - Grid lines are somewhat prominent and could be more subtle for better visual balance
