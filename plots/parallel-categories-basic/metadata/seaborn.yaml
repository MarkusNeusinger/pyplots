review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a parallel categories plot using matplotlib primitives
    since seaborn lacks native support for this chart type
  - Well-structured data generation with realistic Titanic-style survival probability
    patterns
  - Clean Bezier curve ribbons with proportional widths that effectively show flow
    between categories
  - Good color coding by Class with appropriate alpha transparency for overlapping
    ribbons
  - Proper title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is only used for styling (set_style, set_context), not for actual plotting
    - this is primarily a matplotlib implementation
  - Category labels on middle dimensions (fontsize 11 with white text) are smaller
    than optimal for the target resolution
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) and light green (#8FBC8F) may be difficult to distinguish for
    some color vision deficiencies
