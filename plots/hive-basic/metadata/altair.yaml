review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic use case with software module dependencies that directly matches
    the specification example
  - Clean hive plot structure with proper 120-degree axis separation
  - Good node sizing and edge transparency for readability
  - Effective use of Altair layered chart composition
  - Colorblind-accessible palette (blue/yellow/teal)
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional information on hover
  weaknesses:
  - Axis category labels (Core, Utility, Interface) are not visible in the rendered
    output despite code attempting to show them
  - Some node labels on the Core axis are slightly crowded (Logger, Events, Cache)
  - Could benefit from a simple legend or annotation explaining the three module types
