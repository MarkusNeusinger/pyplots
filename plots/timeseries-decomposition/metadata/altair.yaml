review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative faceting to create vertically stacked subplots
    with independent y-scales
  - Clean professional color scheme with distinct colorblind-accessible colors for
    each component
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for authentic decomposition
  - Component labels prominently displayed using facet headers with good font styling
  - Appropriate data coverage with 96 monthly points over 8 years for meaningful decomposition
  - Code follows KISS principles with clear linear flow
  weaknesses:
  - Missing light grid lines that specification explicitly requests
  - Y-axis labels all say generic Value rather than being component-specific
  - Could leverage Altair interactivity features like .interactive() or tooltips
