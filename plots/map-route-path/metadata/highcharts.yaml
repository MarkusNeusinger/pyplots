review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts Maps with TopoJSON basemap for Switzerland
  - Beautiful blue-to-red time progression gradient with 10 color segments
  - Clear start (green circle) and end (red square) markers following spec requirements
  - Direction arrows along the path showing travel direction
  - Interactive HTML version with zoom/pan enabled
  - Realistic Swiss Alps hiking scenario with appropriate coordinate noise and switchbacks
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text before the spec-id format
  - Color scale in legend appears truncated/small in the rendered output
  - Some empty space in upper portion of map could be better utilized
  image_description: The plot displays an Alpine hiking trail GPS track on a map of
    Switzerland. The route is rendered as a thick colored line traversing from right
    (east/START - marked with a green circle) to left (west/END - marked with a red
    square). The route uses a blue-to-red color gradient to show time progression
    over the 6-hour hike - dark blue at the start transitioning through light blue,
    white/cream, orange, and finally dark red at the end. The Switzerland basemap
    is shown in light gray with subtle borders. Yellow circular waypoint markers appear
    at intervals along the route. Blue triangular direction arrows indicate travel
    direction at several points. The title reads "Alpine Hiking Trail · map-route-path
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the GPS track context. A
    legend in the upper right shows Start (0 hrs) with green circle, End (6 hrs) with
    red square, and a color scale from blue to red representing time progression.
    The overall layout is clean with a light blue-gray background.
