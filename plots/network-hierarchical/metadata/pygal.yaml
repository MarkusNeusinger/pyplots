review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical layout algorithm that clearly shows tree structure from
    top to bottom
  - Good use of color coding by level with a colorblind-accessible palette (blue,
    yellow, teal, coral)
  - Clean implementation of edges using None separators for discontinuous line segments
  - Large, clearly visible nodes with appropriate sizing (dots_size=35)
  - Good axis labels that explain the data representation
  - Properly includes tooltips with node labels for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (CEO, VP Eng, etc.) are only visible on hover/tooltip rather than
    displayed directly on the plot
  - The legend indicator for Reporting Lines is a small square that does not clearly
    represent line segments
  - Grid lines visible at y=100 which is above the data range
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical organizational chart using
    pygal''s XY chart type. The visualization shows 4 distinct levels of management
    from top to bottom: a single blue CEO node at the top (Level 0: Executive), 3
    yellow VP nodes below (Level 1: VPs), 7 teal Director nodes at the next level
    (Level 2: Directors), and 11 coral/salmon colored Manager nodes at the bottom
    (Level 3: Managers). Gray lines connect parent nodes to their children, showing
    the reporting structure. The title reads "network-hierarchical · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    in the required format. The legend at the bottom shows all 5 series: Reporting
    Lines, and the 4 hierarchical levels with their corresponding colors. The axes
    are labeled with "Horizontal Position (Peer Distribution)" on the x-axis and "Management
    Level (0=Top, 3=Bottom)" on the y-axis. The layout uses dashed grid lines that
    are appropriately subtle. Node sizes are large and clearly visible.'
