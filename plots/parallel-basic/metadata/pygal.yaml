review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using pygal.Line to simulate parallel coordinates since pygal
    lacks native support
  - Excellent use of the classic Iris dataset which perfectly demonstrates multivariate
    patterns
  - Good color palette with species-specific colors (Python Blue, Yellow, Teal)
  - Proper normalization of data to 0-1 scale for fair comparison across dimensions
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.55) to show overlapping line patterns
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to show species-color mapping - viewers cannot identify which color
    represents which species without reading code comments
  - Font sizes could be larger for the 4800x2700 canvas to improve readability
  - Dots on lines are quite small (size 6) relative to the canvas size
  - The underscore prefix on _species_name suggests an unused variable pattern which
    is slightly misleading
