review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of notched box plots using creative SVG manipulation
    since pygal lacks native support
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required statistical elements (notches, quartiles,
    whiskers, outliers)
  - Outstanding data quality with realistic server benchmark scenario demonstrating
    overlapping and non-overlapping confidence intervals
  - Good colorblind-accessible color palette
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (calc_box_stats, y_to_svg) instead of inline code,
    violating the KISS structure requirement
  - Legend at bottom is somewhat redundant with x-axis category labels
  - Minor layout issue with extra whitespace on right side
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 notched box plots comparing server response
    times across different configurations (Baseline, Config A, Config B, Config C,
    Config D). Each box has a distinctive color: blue for Baseline, yellow for Config
    A, green for Config B, orange for Config C, and purple for Config D. The boxes
    show clear notches around the median line, with whiskers extending to show the
    data range, and outliers displayed as hollow circles. The title "box-notched ·
    pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The Y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)"
    ranging from ~20 to ~220, and the X-axis shows "Server Configuration" with category
    labels. A legend appears at the bottom identifying each configuration by color.'

          but slightly redundant with x-axis labels.

        passed: true
        comment: Creative use of pygal as a base with custom SVG manipulation to achieve
          notched boxes, since pygal doesn't natively support notched box plots. Uses
          pygal's Style system and chart configuration. The SVG manipulation approach
          is clever but could be considered a workaround rather than using distinctive
          pygal features.
  verdict: APPROVED
