review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly go.Barpolar for proper wind rose visualization
  - Meteorologically accurate data simulation with Weibull distribution and prevailing
    westerly winds
  - Clean color progression from cool (calm) to warm (strong) following spec conventions
  - Proper polar orientation with North at top (rotation=90, clockwise)
  - Good text sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700)
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs leveraging Plotly interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit Frequency (%) label for the radial axis to clarify what percentages
    represent
  - Color palette progression from dark blue to light blue could have slightly more
    contrast for the lowest speed bins
