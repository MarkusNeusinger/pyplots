review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (N for nominal,
    Q for quantitative)
  - Clean data-to-visualization mapping using pandas DataFrame
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: cornerRadius for rounded bars, tooltip
    configuration, sort parameter'
  - Currency formatting on Y-axis with format=$,.0f
  - Proper export to both PNG and HTML for interactivity
  - Bars sorted by value (descending) enhances readability and comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Image dimensions (4500x2400) slightly below target specification (4800x2700);
    should use width=1600 for exact match
  - No value labels on or above bars as suggested in the specification Notes section
