review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn split violin feature with inner quartile markers
  - Highly realistic and relevant data scenario (salary by gender/department)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Professional color palette with good contrast and accessibility
  - Well-formatted currency axis labels
  - Title follows exact spec format
  weaknesses:
  - Distribution shapes are relatively similar across all groups - more variety would
    better showcase split violin comparative power
  - Only horizontal grid lines present
