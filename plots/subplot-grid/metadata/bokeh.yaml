review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a cohesive financial dashboard demonstrating diverse
    plot types in a grid
  - Clean code structure with good use of ColumnDataSource for all subplots
  - Effective color scheme using Python blue/yellow with meaningful semantic colors
    for risk categories
  - Proper dual output (PNG and HTML) for both static and interactive viewing
  - Well-organized data generation with realistic financial relationships
  weaknesses:
  - Main title placement is unconventional (added to first subplot rather than as
    true grid title) causing slight visual asymmetry
  - Individual subplot dimensions (2400x1350 each) result in a total grid size that
    may not match the target 4800x2700 exactly
