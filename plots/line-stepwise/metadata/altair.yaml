review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (:Q for
    quantitative)
  - Clean implementation of step-after interpolation which clearly demonstrates the
    stepwise behavior
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: tooltips, configure_axis for grid styling,
    Title object with fontSize'
  - Proper scale configuration with zero=False to focus on the data range
  - Code is clean, well-organized, and follows KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Data shows predominantly upward trend; could benefit from more varied step patterns
    (both increases and decreases) to better demonstrate discrete state changes
  image_description: The plot displays a step line chart showing temperature data
    over 20 days. The line is rendered in a dark blue color (#306998) with step-after
    interpolation, creating horizontal segments that step up vertically at each data
    point. The Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from approximately 23°C to
    35°C. The X-axis shows "Day" from 0 to 20. The title correctly displays "line-stepwise
    · altair · pyplots.ai" at the top. The background is white with subtle dashed
    grid lines. The data shows an overall upward trend with discrete step changes,
    demonstrating the stepwise behavior well.
