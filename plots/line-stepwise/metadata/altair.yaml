review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types (:Q for
    quantitative)
  - Clean implementation of step-after interpolation which clearly demonstrates the
    stepwise behavior
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: tooltips, configure_axis for grid styling,
    Title object with fontSize'
  - Proper scale configuration with zero=False to focus on the data range
  - Code is clean, well-organized, and follows KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Data shows predominantly upward trend; could benefit from more varied step patterns
    (both increases and decreases) to better demonstrate discrete state changes
