review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of density plot with smooth KDE curve and attractive
    fill
  - Rug plot adds valuable detail showing individual observations as recommended in
    spec
  - Clean, professional styling with removed spines and subtle grid
  - Bimodal test score distribution demonstrates multiple distribution characteristics
    (skewness, bimodality)
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  - Good color choice with appropriate alpha values for fill and rug
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could include units for full marks (e.g., Test Score (points))
  - Relies on scipy.stats.gaussian_kde rather than exploring matplotlib-native density
    plotting options
  image_description: The plot displays a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve for
    test scores. The main distribution is shown as a smooth blue curve (#306998) with
    semi-transparent blue fill. The density peaks around 72-75 representing the main
    student group, with a visible shoulder/secondary mode around 45 from the lower-performing
    group, demonstrating the slight bimodality. A rug plot at the bottom shows individual
    observations as vertical tick marks in matching blue. The title "density-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. X-axis labeled "Test Score"
    ranges from ~20 to ~100+, Y-axis labeled "Density" ranges from 0 to ~0.026. The
    plot has clean styling with removed top/right spines and subtle dashed gridlines.

        comment: Uses scipy for KDE rather than matplotlib-native features. Good use
          of fill_between, spines removal, but could leverage more matplotlib-specific
          styling
  verdict: APPROVED
