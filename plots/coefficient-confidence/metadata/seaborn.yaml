review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, publication-ready appearance with proper text sizing
  - Correct horizontal layout with variables on y-axis for long variable names
  - Good use of color coding for significance distinction
  - Excellent data context (housing price regression is universally understood)
  - Proper sorting by coefficient magnitude for easy comparison
  - Yellow dashed reference line at zero is highly visible
  weaknesses:
  - Minimal seaborn usage - error bars drawn with matplotlib hlines rather than leveraging
    seaborn native capabilities
  - Legend label order handling is manual and could be cleaner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot showing 12 regression
    coefficients from a housing price prediction model. Variables are listed on the
    y-axis (sorted by coefficient magnitude from "Crime Rate Index" at bottom to "Square
    Footage" at top). The x-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate (Standardized)" ranging
    from approximately -0.4 to 0.5. Each coefficient is represented by a point (marker)
    with horizontal error bars showing confidence intervals. A vertical dashed yellow
    line at x=0 marks the null hypothesis threshold. Points and error bars are colored
    in blue (#306998) for statistically significant coefficients and gray (#808080)
    for non-significant ones. The legend in the lower right distinguishes "Not Significant"
    (gray) from "Significant (p < 0.05)" (blue). The title follows the required format:
    "coefficient-confidence · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The plot has good proportions
    with adequate whitespace and a subtle x-axis grid.'

        comment: Uses seaborn scatterplot but manually constructs error bars with
          matplotlib hlines. Implementation is mostly matplotlib with minimal seaborn
          usage.
