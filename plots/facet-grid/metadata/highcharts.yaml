review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex 3×3 faceted grid using Highcharts multi-axis
    capability
  - Colorblind-safe palette with clear visual distinction between soil types (blue/yellow/purple)
  - Realistic plant growth study with meaningful data patterns showing light and soil
    effects
  - Proper use of annotations module for column and row facet labels
  - Correct title format and subtitle explaining the faceting structure
  - Shared axis scales across all facets enabling direct comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label shows 'Values' instead of 'Growth (cm)' in middle and right columns
    (inconsistent labeling)
  - Text sizes could be larger for optimal readability at 4800×2700 resolution
