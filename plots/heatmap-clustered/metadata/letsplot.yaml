review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of composite plot using ggbunch to combine dendrograms
    with heatmap
  - Creative solution using scipy for hierarchical clustering since lets-plot lacks
    native clustermap
  - Proper diverging colormap (blue-white-red) centered at zero for expression data
  - Good visual separation between cluster groups reveals biological patterns
  - Dendrograms properly aligned with heatmap through careful coordinate transformation
  - Realistic gene expression scenario perfect for demonstrating clustered heatmaps
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function get_dendrogram_segments() which violates the KISS no-functions
    principle
  - Gene labels on y-axis are slightly small (size=10) for optimal readability at
    full resolution
  - Legend is positioned somewhat far from the main heatmap due to ggbunch layout
    constraints
