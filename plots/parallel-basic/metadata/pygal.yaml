review:
  strengths:
  - Uses the Iris dataset which is a classic, realistic example for parallel coordinates
  - Proper normalization to 0-1 scale for fair comparison across dimensions
  - Good transparency (opacity=0.55) helps visualize overlapping lines
  - Colorblind-friendly palette (blue, yellow, teal)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean KISS code structure with no unnecessary functions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is not visible in the rendered plot making species identification impossible
    without code knowledge
  - The workaround using [None, None, None, None] for legend entries does not render
    the legend properly
  - Font sizes could be larger for better readability at 4800x2700 resolution
