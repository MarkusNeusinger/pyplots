review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-layer visualization clearly distinguishing raw data from smoothed
    trend
  - Appropriate use of alpha/size differentiation to show raw data as secondary and
    rolling average as primary
  - Realistic temperature sensor scenario with seasonal variation matches specification
    perfectly
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation
  - Proper legend placement at top with clear labeling including window size
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears as three separate legend groups (color, alpha, size) instead of
    a unified legend - consider using guides() to merge them
  - Raw data line could be slightly thicker for better visibility while maintaining
    transparency
  image_description: The plot displays a time series of simulated daily sensor temperature
    readings spanning January to July 2024. The raw data is shown as a semi-transparent
    blue line with noticeable day-to-day volatility ranging from approximately 12°C
    to 33°C. Overlaid is a thick yellow/gold line representing the 14-Day Rolling
    Average, which smoothly reveals the underlying seasonal warming trend (rising
    from ~16°C in January to ~26°C in May, then declining). The title "line-timeseries-rolling
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis shows "Date" with monthly
    labels (Jan-Jul), and the y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)". A legend at the top
    clearly distinguishes "Raw Data" from "14-Day Rolling Avg". Grid lines are subtle
    gray. The rolling average line is shorter than the raw data (starts mid-January)
    as expected due to the window requirement.
