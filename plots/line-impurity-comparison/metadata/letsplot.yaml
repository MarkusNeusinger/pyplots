review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance with all required features implemented (formulas in
    legend, annotations at p=0.5, edge case handling)
  - Strong visual storytelling through the shaded ribbon between curves, open circle
    markers at maxima, and informative subtitle
  - Colorblind-safe blue/orange palette with good contrast
  - Idiomatic lets-plot usage with proper ggplot2-style grammar and layer_tooltips
  - All font sizes explicitly set to appropriate values for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Lower portion of the canvas is underutilized due to parabolic curve shapes, resulting
    in significant empty space below the curves
  - Annotation DataFrames are overly fragmented (5 separate DataFrames for point annotations
    could be consolidated)
  - Could leverage additional distinctive lets-plot features (e.g., coord_fixed, geom_segment
    for annotation arrows, or interactive callbacks)
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth curves on a clean white canvas
    with a subtle light gray grid. A blue curve represents Gini impurity (labeled
    "Gini: 2p(1−p)") peaking at 0.5 on the y-axis at p=0.5, and an orange curve represents
    normalized Entropy (labeled "Entropy (normalized)") peaking at 1.0 on the y-axis
    at p=0.5. A light blue shaded ribbon fills the area between the two curves, highlighting
    their difference. Open circle markers (blue and orange with white fill) are placed
    at each curve''s maximum at p=0.5. A dashed vertical gray guide line marks p=0.5.
    An italic annotation reads "Maximum uncertainty at p = 0.5" above the entropy
    maximum, and another italic annotation reads "Shaded region: difference between
    metrics" in the right-center area. The title "line-impurity-comparison · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" is bold at the top, with an italic subtitle explaining the insight.
    A legend at the bottom identifies both metrics. X-axis is labeled "Probability
    of class 1 (p)" (0 to 1 in 0.1 steps), Y-axis is "Impurity measure (normalized)"
    (0 to 1 in 0.2 steps).'
