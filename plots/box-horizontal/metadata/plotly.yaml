review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic service response time distributions showing
    varied spreads and outliers
  - Services sorted by median for easier comparison as recommended in specification
  - Clean alternating color scheme using Python brand colors (blue/yellow)
  - Proper use of plotly.graph_objects for horizontal box plots
  - Good margin management (l=180) to accommodate longer service names
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs appropriate for plotly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity at 0.1 is quite subtle; could be increased to 0.2-0.3 for better
    readability
  - Could add hover template customization to show more statistics on hover (plotly
    strength)
