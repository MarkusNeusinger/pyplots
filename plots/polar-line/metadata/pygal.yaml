review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of monthly temperature data demonstrating cyclical patterns perfectly
    suited for polar visualization
  - Strong color contrast between blue and yellow series that is colorblind-accessible
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with well-organized custom styling
  - Good use of pygal Radar chart features including inner_radius for visual appeal
  - Title follows exact specification format
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis title or label indicating units (radial axis should show Temperature
    in °C)
  - Dot markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Could showcase additional pygal features like tooltips or value display on hover
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/polar line chart with monthly labels
    (Jan through Dec) arranged around the perimeter. Two data series are shown: "Northern
    City" in blue (#306998) and "Coastal City" in yellow (#FFD43B). The blue line
    shows dramatic seasonal variation with peaks around July (27°C) and troughs in
    winter months (2-4°C). The yellow line shows more moderate variation (10-23°C
    range). Concentric polygonal grid lines mark values from 0 to 24. Data points
    are marked with dots at each month position. The title "polar-line · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top center. A legend at the bottom identifies the two city series.'
