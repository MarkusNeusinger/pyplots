review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of contrasting text colors based on background intensity
    using scale_color_identity
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_tile + geom_text)
  - Good choice of RdBu diverging palette for correlation data with appropriate limits
    (-1, 1)
  - Proper categorical ordering to maintain consistent variable arrangement
  - Well-formatted annotations with 2 decimal places as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (Variable / Variable) - could be more descriptive like
    Economic Indicator
  - Figure size is 12x12 at 300dpi - library guidelines suggest 16x9 landscape as
    default
  - Library features score is modest - implementation works but does not showcase
    unique plotnine capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays an 8×8 correlation matrix heatmap of economic
    indicators (GDP Growth, Inflation, Unemployment, Interest Rate, Consumer Conf,
    Mfg Index, Export Vol, Housing). The heatmap uses a diverging RdBu (red-blue)
    colormap with red indicating negative correlations and blue indicating positive
    correlations. Each cell contains the correlation coefficient formatted to 2 decimal
    places. The diagonal shows 1.00 values (self-correlation) in deep blue. Text colors
    automatically switch between white (for dark backgrounds with |correlation| >
    0.5) and black (for light backgrounds) for readability. The colorbar on the right
    shows the correlation scale from -1.0 to 1.0. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees.
    The title follows the required format. The plot uses a square aspect ratio with
    white borders between cells.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar well with geom_tile + geom_text, scale_fill_distiller,
          and scale_color_identity, but doesn't leverage any unique plotnine features
          beyond standard ggplot2 patterns
  verdict: APPROVED
