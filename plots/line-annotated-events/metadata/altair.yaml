review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating y-positions for event labels to prevent overlap
  - Clean layered chart composition with separate charts for line, rules, markers,
    and labels
  - Good color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and contrasting yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Realistic stock price data with appropriate volatility
  - Proper use of Altair encoding types (:T, :Q, :N)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend/key for event types as suggested in spec notes
  - Vertical rules use hardcoded y2=alt.value(900) which may not align with actual
    chart height
  - No tooltips on event markers for interactivity (missed opportunity for Altair's
    strength)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price time series spanning January
    2024 to December 2024, with prices ranging from approximately $120 to $200. A
    blue line (#306998) traces the stock price trajectory showing typical market volatility.
    Six vertical dashed yellow lines (#FFD43B) mark key events: Q4 Earnings (Feb),
    Q1 Earnings (late Apr), Product Launch (Jun), Q2 Earnings (late Jul), Analyst
    Upgrade (Sep), and Q3 Earnings (Nov). Each event has a yellow circular marker
    with blue outline positioned at alternating heights above the data, with bold
    text labels. The title "line-annotated-events · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top. Axis labels show "Date" on x-axis and "Stock Price ($)" on y-axis
    with subtle gray gridlines.'
