  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_pointrange for clean point-and-interval visualization
  - Proper horizontal orientation with coord_flip for readable category labels
  - Reference line at zero helps interpretation of effect sizes
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700 output
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with varying confidence interval widths
  weaknesses:
  - All effect sizes are positive; including at least one negative or zero-crossing
    effect would better demonstrate the plot utility
  - Does not include error bar caps at endpoints (spec suggests caps)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal point estimate plot with confidence
    intervals. It shows 5 treatment groups (Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C,
    Control, Placebo) on the y-axis and Effect Size (95% CI) on the x-axis. Each group
    has a blue point (#306998) representing the estimate with horizontal lines extending
    to show confidence intervals. A vertical dashed gray reference line is drawn at
    x=0. The title "point-basic · lets-plot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The
    plot uses a minimal theme with a clean white background, subtle horizontal grid
    lines, and well-sized text throughout.
