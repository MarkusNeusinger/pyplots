review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of nested confidence bands with appropriate alpha blending
  - Clear visual distinction between historical (solid blue) and forecast (dashed
    orange) periods
  - Realistic data with trend and seasonality that demonstrates the visualization
    purpose well
  - Confidence intervals correctly widen over time showing increasing uncertainty
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper left partially overlaps the start of the confidence
    bands - consider lower left or outside the plot
  - Could add a small overlap period between historical and forecast for better continuity
    (as suggested in spec)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series forecast visualization for monthly
    retail sales data spanning from January 2022 to January 2026. The historical period
    (36 months) is shown as a solid blue line (#306998) exhibiting an upward trend
    with clear annual seasonality - peaks around mid-year and troughs around year-end.
    A vertical gray dotted line at January 2025 marks the forecast start. The forecast
    period (12 months) is shown as an orange dashed line (#E07000). Two nested yellow
    shaded bands represent the confidence intervals: a darker yellow band (alpha 0.5)
    for the 80% CI and a lighter yellow band (alpha 0.3) for the 95% CI. The bands
    appropriately widen over time, demonstrating increasing uncertainty with longer
    forecast horizons. The title "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    is displayed prominently at the top. A clear legend in the upper left identifies
    all elements. The x-axis shows dates with 6-month intervals, and the y-axis shows
    "Monthly Sales (thousands)" ranging from ~80 to 180.'

          marker, autofmt_xdate for date formatting; could use more advanced features
