review:
  strengths:
  - Per-patch alpha gradient shading by bar height is a creative, matplotlib-distinctive
    technique
  - All font sizes explicitly set to spec-compliant values (24/20/16)
  - Clean data generation with realistic exam score distribution (base + high-performer
    cluster)
  - Proper spine removal, subtle grid, and white bar edges create polished visual
    refinement
  - KISS code structure with perfect reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the distribution has interesting features (central tendency
    around 72, high-performer cluster at 88) but no annotations, mean/median lines,
    or callouts guide the viewer attention'
  - The high-performer cluster could be more visually distinct or explicitly highlighted
    to showcase the bimodal aspect of the data
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of exam scores ranging from approximately
    30 to 100 points, divided into 25 bins. Bars are rendered in Python Blue (#306998)
    with a distinctive gradient effect — taller bars appear at higher opacity while
    shorter bars are more transparent, achieved through per-patch alpha manipulation.
    White edges (linewidth 1.5) cleanly separate adjacent bins. The distribution is
    roughly normal, centered around 70–75, with visible left skew and a secondary
    cluster in the 75–85 range from the injected high-performer group. Title reads
    "histogram-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in medium-weight font at the top.
    X-axis is labeled "Exam Score (points)" and Y-axis "Frequency (count)". Top and
    right spines are removed. Subtle horizontal grid lines appear behind the bars.
    Y-axis starts at zero. The plot fills the 16:9 canvas well with balanced margins.
