review:
  strengths:
  - Clear cell annotations displaying exact CPU load values - fulfills the 'tooltip
    display' requirement in spirit
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic server performance monitoring scenario with plausible time-based load
    patterns
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Appropriate text contrast - white text on dark cells, black on bright cells
  weaknesses:
  - Image appears cropped - only shows 12 of 15 servers (rows) and 12 of 20 time columns
    defined in the code; either the figsize or the data dimensions need adjustment
  - Spec requires 10-100 rows/columns but implementation uses 15x20 which is appropriate,
    however the visual output is incomplete
  - The instruction text at bottom is not visible in the output image due to cropping/layout
    issues
  image_description: 'The plot displays a heatmap showing server CPU load data with
    a 12x12 visible grid (though code defines 15x20). The Y-axis shows "Server" with
    labels Server 01 through Server 12. The X-axis shows "Time of Day" with hourly
    intervals from 06:00 to 17:00. Each cell contains a bold numeric annotation showing
    the exact CPU load percentage (0-100). The viridis colormap is used: dark purple/blue
    for low values (0-30%), teal/green for medium values (30-60%), and yellow for
    high values (80-100%). A vertical colorbar on the right side is labeled "CPU Load
    (%)" with a scale from 0-100. The title "heatmap-interactive · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. The data shows a realistic pattern where load tends to be
    higher during midday hours (10:00-13:00) and lower in early morning/late afternoon.
    Text annotations use appropriate contrast (white on dark cells, black on light
    cells) for readability. However, the image appears to be missing 3 rows (Server
    13-15) and 8 columns (04:00-05:00 and 18:00-23:00) that should exist based on
    the code, suggesting a layout or cropping issue.'
