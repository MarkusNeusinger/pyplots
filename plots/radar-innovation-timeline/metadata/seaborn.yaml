review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn color generation utilities (light_palette, blend_palette,
    desaturate) for ring gradient and background fills
  - Sophisticated collision-detection label placement algorithm that keeps all 27
    labels readable
  - Strong visual storytelling through marker size variation, ring color gradients,
    and directional cues (Ready to Emerging)
  - Dual encoding (color + shape) for sectors ensures colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic, well-researched technology data with plausible adoption timeline assignments
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation item labels at fontsize=13 could be slightly larger (15-16pt) for optimal
    readability at full resolution
  - The collision detection code is functional but verbose — a minor code elegance
    concern
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree radar/innovation radar chart
    on a polar coordinate system. Four concentric rings represent time horizons: Adopt
    (innermost, light green background), Trial (light yellow-orange), Assess (light
    yellow), and Hold (outermost, light pink-red). The angular space is divided into
    four sectors with bold colored headers: Sustainability (upper-left, green), Cloud
    & Infra (upper-right, orange), AI & ML (right, blue), and Biotech (lower-left,
    purple). Each of the 27 innovation items is plotted as a distinctly shaped marker
    — blue circles for AI & ML, orange squares for Cloud & Infra, green diamonds for
    Sustainability, and purple triangles for Biotech. Marker sizes vary by ring importance
    (larger for Adopt, smaller for Hold). Each item has a white-backgrounded text
    label with a subtle gray connector line. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold)
    appear along the left edge in gray text boxes. Directional cues "Ready" (green,
    inner) and "Emerging" (red, outer) guide the reader. A combined legend in the
    lower-right shows sector colors/shapes and ring size encodings. The title reads
    "radar-innovation-timeline · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top.'

        comment: 270-degree layout fills canvas well. Slight whitespace imbalance
          in lower portion due to intentional 270° design.

        comment: Ring labels serve as radial axis labels, sector headers as angular
          labels. Title follows required format.
