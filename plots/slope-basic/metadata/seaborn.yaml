review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color coding distinguishing increases (blue) from decreases (yellow)
    with colorblind-safe palette
  - Clear entity labels at both endpoints with values in parentheses for easy reading
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid) and lineplot function
  - Well-proportioned layout with appropriate margins for labels
  - Realistic tech company revenue scenario that demonstrates the visualization purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap around the 125-175 revenue range where multiple entities cluster
  - Seaborn lineplot used in a loop rather than leveraging native grouping capabilities
  - Could benefit from more dramatic rank changes in the data to better showcase slope
    chart strength
