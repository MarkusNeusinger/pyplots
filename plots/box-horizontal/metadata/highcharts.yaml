review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario using API response times by service type
  - Proper use of Highcharts inverted chart for horizontal orientation
  - Good color scheme with Python blue boxes and yellow median lines for contrast
  - Well-sized text elements readable at full resolution
  - Correct whisker calculation using 1.5*IQR methodology
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Data does not include explicit outlier points which would better demonstrate box
    plot capabilities
  - Vertical spacing between box plots could be tighter to reduce whitespace
