review:
  strengths:
  - Clear, publication-quality visualization with excellent text legibility at all
    sizes
  - Error bars have prominent caps (width=16) making error ranges clearly visible
  - Realistic experimental scenario with control and treatment groups
  - Appropriate marker sizing (28) with clean border styling
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Only demonstrates symmetric error bars; could show asymmetric errors to better
    showcase the plot type capabilities
  - Legend could be positioned better (currently overlaps with potential data area
    in top-left)
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates showing exact
    values
  image_description: The plot displays a basic error bar chart with 6 experimental
    groups (Control, Treatment A through E) on the x-axis and "Response Value (units)"
    on the y-axis ranging from 0 to 90. Each data point is shown as a large blue circular
    marker (#306998 color) with vertical error bars extending above and below. The
    error bars have clearly visible horizontal caps at both ends. The title "errorbar-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. A legend labeled "Mean ± SE" appears
    in the top-left corner. The background is white with subtle horizontal gridlines.
    All text is legible and appropriately sized.

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with error_y which is standard Plotly; also generates
          interactive HTML output which is a Plotly strength. However, could leverage
          more Plotly-specific features like hover templates or animations
  verdict: APPROVED
