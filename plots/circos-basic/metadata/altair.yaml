review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper segment proportions and gaps
  - Creative use of Altair mark_line with filled=True to create arc shapes
  - Well-implemented Bezier curves for ribbon connections
  - Good color palette that maintains segment identity throughout
  - Inner track provides additional data dimension with darker shades
  - Clean readable code structure with clear data definitions
  - Tooltips added to ribbons for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Some ribbons in the center appear slightly congested making individual connections
    harder to trace
  - Inner track bars could have more visible separation from each other
  - Legend shows segment colors but not inner track or ribbon meaning
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Circos-style circular visualization showing
    software module dependencies. Eight segments are arranged around a circle: Core
    (blue), API (yellow), Database (green), Auth (crimson), Cache (purple), Queue
    (teal), Logger (orange), and Config (gray). Each segment''s arc length is proportional
    to its relative size/importance. An inner concentric track shows darker-shaded
    bars representing activity/importance values. Semi-transparent ribbons connect
    segments through the center, with curved Bezier paths showing dependencies between
    modules (e.g., Core-API, Core-Database, API-Auth). Labels are positioned outside
    each segment in matching colors. The title "circos-basic · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top.'

        comment: Uses layered composition, tooltips, and declarative encoding; however,
          Circos requires manual geometry calculation rather than leveraging Altair's
          strengths
  verdict: APPROVED
