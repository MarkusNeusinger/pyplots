review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of mirror points technique to ensure all Voronoi cells are finite
    and properly bounded
  - Clean implementation using scipy.spatial.Voronoi with PolyCollection for efficient
    rendering
  - Good visual design with colorblind-safe palette and prominent seed point markers
  - Proper clipping of polygons to bounding box
  - Follows KISS principles with clear, linear code structure
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "X Coordinate (units)" or use a more domain-specific
    context)
  - Could demonstrate more distinctive library features beyond basic PolyCollection
    usage
  image_description: The plot displays a Voronoi diagram with 15 seed points distributed
    across a 10×10 coordinate space. Each Voronoi cell is filled with a distinct color
    from a varied pastel palette (light green, pink/coral, cyan, yellow, purple/lavender,
    blue-gray). The seed points are rendered as prominent dark blue (#306998) circles
    with white edge highlights, clearly visible within their respective cells. Cell
    boundaries are drawn with dark gray (#333333) edges with good line weight. The
    plot has a subtle dashed grid at alpha=0.3. The title "voronoi-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in appropriate font size. Axis labels "X Coordinate"
    and "Y Coordinate" are clearly readable. The aspect ratio is equal (1:1), and
    the plot fills the canvas well with balanced margins. All cells are properly clipped
    to the bounding box [0, 10] × [0, 10].
