review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual distinction between raw data (blue, semi-transparent) and rolling
    average (yellow, prominent)
  - Realistic temperature scenario with clear seasonal pattern that demonstrates the
    value of rolling averages
  - Proper handling of NaN values at rolling window boundaries by creating separate
    data sources
  - Interactive tools included (pan, wheel_zoom, box_zoom, reset, save) and HTML output
    generated
  - Clean KISS code structure following Bokeh best practices with ColumnDataSource
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text appears small at the top left corner when viewing the full-resolution
    image
  - Could add HoverTool to display exact date and temperature values on hover for
    better interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a time series visualization of daily temperature
    data spanning January 2024 to January 2025. A semi-transparent blue line shows
    raw daily temperature readings with visible day-to-day noise/volatility. A prominent
    smooth yellow/gold line overlays the raw data showing the 30-day rolling average.
    The visualization clearly demonstrates a seasonal temperature pattern, with values
    starting around 5-10°C in January, rising to peak around 35°C in July (summer),
    then declining back toward 0-5°C by December. The title "line-timeseries-rolling
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top left. A legend distinguishes "Raw Data"
    (blue) from "30-Day Rolling Average" (yellow). The x-axis shows month labels (Jan
    2024 through Jan 2025), and the y-axis displays "Temperature (°C)" ranging from
    0 to ~45. A subtle grid with dashed lines aids readability. The rolling average
    line is shorter at both ends due to the centered window calculation.
