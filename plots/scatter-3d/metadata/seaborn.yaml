not_feasible: true
not_feasible_reason: 'AR-06: Seaborn is fundamentally a 2D statistical visualization
  library and has no native 3D scatter plot capability. Any 3D implementation requires
  matplotlib''s mplot3d, with seaborn only providing styling (set_theme, set_context,
  color_palette), which violates AR-05 (library must use plot functions, not just
  styling).'
review:
  strengths:
  - Uses viridis colormap for colorblind-safe color encoding
  - Clear axis labels with units (nm for position, eV for energy)
  - Well-organized 3D clustered data showing molecular positions
  weaknesses:
  - 'CRITICAL: Seaborn does not support 3D plotting - implementation uses matplotlib
    3D axes (ax.scatter with projection=3d) with only seaborn styling (sns.set_theme,
    sns.set_context, sns.color_palette)'
  - 'Violates AR-05: No seaborn plot functions used (must use sns.scatterplot, sns.barplot,
    etc.)'
  - 'AR-06 NOT_FEASIBLE: Seaborn is fundamentally a 2D visualization library built
    on matplotlib 2D axes and cannot create native 3D plots'
