review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizing and no text overlap
  - Color gradient effectively communicates relative importance
  - Error bars with caps clearly show ensemble variability
  - Realistic credit scoring context with appropriate feature names
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper seaborn 0.14+ API usage
  - Value annotations positioned well and aid interpretation
  weaknesses:
  - Error bars are added manually via matplotlib instead of leveraging seaborn built-in
    errorbar capabilities
