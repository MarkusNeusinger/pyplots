review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and appropriate bar spacing
  - Perfect implementation of diverging bar concept with clear zero baseline
  - Data sorted by value enhances pattern recognition as recommended in spec
  - Horizontal orientation ideal for displaying category labels
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Blue/yellow color scheme is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain color coding (blue=satisfied, yellow=dissatisfied)
  - X-axis label could include units like Satisfaction Score (NPS-style -100 to +100)
  - Data values could include more extreme scores closer to ±100 for fuller demonstration
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing customer
    satisfaction survey results across 10 departments. Blue bars (#306998) extend
    rightward from the zero baseline for positive scores, while yellow/gold bars (#FFD43B)
    extend leftward for negative scores. The data is sorted by value from highest
    (Customer Support at +72) at the top to lowest (Return Policy at -42) at the bottom.
    Each bar displays its value with +/- sign positioned outside the bar. A clear
    dark vertical line marks the zero baseline. The x-axis spans -100 to +100 with
    tick marks at 25-point intervals. Title reads "Customer Satisfaction Survey ·
    bar-diverging · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at top. The layout uses a clean
    white template with subtle gridlines.
