  strengths:
  - 'All spec requirements met: percentage labels, distinct colors, legend, exploded
    slice'
  - Excellent text legibility with explicitly set font sizes throughout
  - Realistic, neutral dataset (cloud market share) with realistic proportions
  - Clean, well-structured code with no unnecessary complexity
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual contrast between slices
  - Nice typography hierarchy with bold title, gray subtitle, and normal-weight labels
  weaknesses:
  - Empty space between the pie and the bottom legend wastes canvas area — consider
    increasing pie size or reducing gap
  - No data storytelling annotations — adding callouts like Top 3 providers control
    67% of market or highlighting the AWS dominance would elevate the chart
  - Subtitle provides temporal context but the chart does not guide the viewer toward
    any specific insight
  - 'The exploded slice could be more visually dramatic (slicedOffset: 35 is modest
    at this scale)'
  image_description: 'The plot is a pie chart on a white background in square (3600x3600)
    format. It displays "Cloud Infrastructure Market Share" with 5 slices: AWS (dark
    blue, 31.0%), Azure (golden yellow, 25.0%), Google Cloud (terra cotta orange,
    11.0%), Alibaba (teal/cyan, 4.0%), and Others (medium purple, 29.0%). The AWS
    slice is exploded (pulled outward) for emphasis. Data labels are positioned outside
    each slice with thin gray connector lines, showing category name and percentage
    in bold. The title reads "Cloud Infrastructure Market Share · pie-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" in bold, with a gray subtitle "Global cloud spending by provider,
    2024" beneath it. A horizontal legend with colored circles sits at the bottom.
    The pie occupies the center-upper portion of the canvas with notable whitespace
    below the pie and above the legend.'
