review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation from scratch without external dependencies
  - Clear visual hierarchy with edge thickness proportionally conveying trade volume
  - Node sizing by weighted degree adds valuable information layer
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles with no unnecessary complexity
  - Professional styling with minimal chrome and well-placed legend
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color gradient uses grayscale which can be confusing since edges are also
    gray
  - Spring layout algorithm is simplified; edges with higher weight should attract
    nodes more strongly
  image_description: 'The plot displays a weighted network graph representing international
    trade relationships between 15 countries. Nodes are positioned using a force-directed
    layout with USA centrally placed. Node labels (country names) appear in bold black
    text above each node. Edges are rendered as gray segments (color #888888) with
    varying thickness representing trade volume in billions USD - thicker lines indicate
    higher trade values. The heaviest edges connect USA-China (~550B), USA-Mexico
    (~420B), and USA-Canada (~380B). Node sizes vary based on weighted degree, with
    USA and China appearing as larger blue (#306998) circles. A legend in the bottom-right
    corner shows the trade volume scale from 100 to 500 billion USD. The title follows
    the correct format: "network-weighted · letsplot · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "International
    Trade Network (Edge Thickness = Trade Volume)". The background is clean white
    with minimal chrome (no axes, gridlines, or tick marks).'
