review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical structure with group headers and indented tasks
  - Clear dependency visualization with connector lines and arrowheads
  - Good use of color coding for different project phases
  - Proper aggregate bars showing group spans with transparency
  - Interactive HTML export as bonus
  weaknesses:
  - Task labels on the left side are relatively small (16pt) for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Title font size (32pt) could be larger for better prominence
  - Legend is positioned far from the chart content on the right edge
  - Some dependency arrows pass through task bars rather than routing around them
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Gantt chart with task dependencies for a
    software development project. The chart has a white background with the title
    "gantt-dependencies · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top left. Tasks are organized
    hierarchically by four groups: Requirements (blue), Design (yellow), Development
    (green), and Testing (pink). Each group has a lighter semi-transparent aggregate
    bar showing the group span, with individual task bars in solid colors below. Tasks
    are labeled on the left side with group names and indented task names. Dependency
    arrows connect tasks with gray connector lines featuring small triangular arrowheads,
    showing finish-to-start relationships. The x-axis shows a timeline from Jan 01
    2026 to Mar 01 with the label "Timeline". A legend on the right side identifies
    the four groups by color. The chart effectively visualizes 12 tasks across 4 phases
    with clear dependency connectors.'
