review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe palette for species differentiation
  - Clean hierarchical structure clearly showing species relationships (Setosa distinct,
    Versicolor/Virginica mixed)
  - Species-colored x-axis labels with bold font enhance readability
  - Proper use of Ward linkage method for meaningful clustering
  - Good sample size (30) within recommended 10-50 range for readable dendrograms
  - Title and axis labels follow specification format exactly
  - Subtle y-axis grid with alpha=0.3 provides reference without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Legend color markers use squares but appear slightly different shade than the
    x-axis label colors (minor visual inconsistency)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical dendrogram visualizing clustering
    of 30 iris flower samples (10 from each species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
    The dendrogram uses Ward linkage distances on the y-axis (ranging from 0 to ~15).
    The tree structure clearly shows Setosa samples clustering together on the left
    with low merge distances (~1.5), while Versicolor and Virginica samples cluster
    together on the right with higher merge distances (~6-7), reflecting that these
    two species are more similar to each other than to Setosa. Branch colors correspond
    to clusters, with orange branches for Setosa, green branches for Versicolor/Virginica
    clusters. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees and color-coded by species (teal/blue
    for Setosa, orange for Versicolor, green for Virginica). A legend in the upper
    right identifies the species. The title follows the required format "dendrogram-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Grid lines are subtle and present only on the y-axis.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme, sns.set_context, sns.color_palette, sns.despine;
          however, core dendrogram is from scipy (seaborn has no native dendrogram),
          seaborn primarily used for theming and aesthetics
  verdict: APPROVED
