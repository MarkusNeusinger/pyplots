review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of faceted grid layout using creative PIL-based composition
    approach
  - Clear, readable labels with proper units (Height in cm, Days)
  - Consistent shared y-axis range across all facets for easy comparison
  - Realistic plant growth scenario with meaningful variation between conditions
  - Clean color scheme using pyplots primary blue (#306998)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently visible but acceptable)
  - The faceted composition relies heavily on PIL rather than pygal native features
    - this is a reasonable workaround given pygal limitations
  - Row labels could be slightly larger for better visibility
  image_description: The plot displays a 2×3 faceted grid showing plant growth data
    (height vs days). The grid has two rows labeled "Sandy Soil" and "Clay Soil" (rotated
    labels on left side), and three columns labeled "Low Light", "Medium Light", and
    "High Light" at the top. Each cell contains a line chart with blue lines and circular
    markers showing plant height (cm) on the y-axis (0-32 range) over days (0-30)
    on the x-axis. The main title "facet-grid · pygal · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top in dark gray. All subplots share consistent y-axis scales. The layout
    is clean with light gray plot backgrounds and subtle horizontal grid lines.
