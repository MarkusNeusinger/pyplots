review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with high contrast black/white cells and subtle cell
    gaps
  - Proper Data Matrix structure with L-shaped finder and alternating timing patterns
  - Clean code following KISS principles with good reproducibility
  - Effective use of Plotly heatmap and annotation features
  - Correct title format and informative annotations showing encoded content
  weaknesses:
  - Interior data pattern is simulated with random values rather than true Reed-Solomon
    ECC 200 encoding (acceptable for visualization demo)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 16×16 Data Matrix 2D barcode rendered as
    a heatmap with black and white cells on a white background. The title "datamatrix-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray text (~28pt). The matrix
    shows an L-shaped finder pattern with solid black on the left column and bottom
    row, and alternating (clock) patterns on the top row and right column. The interior
    cells contain a pseudo-random pattern derived from the encoded content. Below
    the matrix are two annotation lines: "Encoded: SERIAL:12345678" in medium gray
    and "ECC 200 | 16×16 Matrix" in lighter gray. The barcode maintains a square 1:1
    aspect ratio with adequate white quiet zone margins around it. Thin white gaps
    separate each cell for clarity.'
