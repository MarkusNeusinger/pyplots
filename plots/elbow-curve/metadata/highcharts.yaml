review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate font sizes and marker visibility
  - Proper implementation of elbow curve with clear elbow point annotation using Highcharts
    annotations module
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with reproducible random seed
  - Correctly uses both LineSeries and ScatterSeries for different purposes
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper right corner could be better integrated with the chart
    area
  - Could leverage more Highcharts-specific interactive features for the interactive
    HTML output
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering with
    a white background. The X-axis shows "Number of Clusters (k)" ranging from 1 to
    12, and the Y-axis shows "Inertia (Within-cluster Sum of Squares)" ranging from
    0 to 16,000. A blue line (#306998) connects circular blue markers at each k value,
    showing the characteristic elbow curve shape with inertia decreasing rapidly from
    ~15,000 at k=1 to ~4,500 at k=4, then leveling off. The elbow point at k=4 is
    highlighted with a yellow diamond marker (#FFD43B) with blue outline, accompanied
    by a yellow annotation label reading "Elbow Point (k=4)". A legend in the upper
    right shows "Inertia" (blue circle) and "Optimal k = 4" (yellow diamond). The
    title "elbow-curve · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the
    top. Grid lines are subtle dashed gray lines. The layout is clean and professional.
