review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with properly sized fonts (28pt title, 22pt axis titles,
    18pt tick labels)
  - Smart date formatting with %b %Y format adapts well to yearly time span
  - Rotated x-axis labels at -45° effectively prevent overlap
  - Realistic stock price data with 252 trading days accurately represents one year
    of market data
  - Interactive features (zoom/pan and tooltips) enhance user experience
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines only appear on y-axis; x-axis grid would improve temporal data readability
    as noted in spec
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like selections, layered views, or
    conditional formatting
  - Starting price of exactly 100 feels artificial; a more realistic starting value
    would improve authenticity
