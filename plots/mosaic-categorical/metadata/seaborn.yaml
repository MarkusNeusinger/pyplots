review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn colorblind palette for accessibility
  - Clean implementation using Titanic dataset which perfectly demonstrates categorical
    associations
  - Frequency labels are well-positioned and legible within each rectangle
  - Title follows the correct format specification
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Rounded rectangle corners add visual polish
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot as suggested in the specification
    (builds mosaic manually)
  - Legend placement could be improved - currently in upper right but slightly disconnected
    from the plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a mosaic chart showing Titanic passenger survival
    by class. The visualization uses a blue and yellow color scheme from seaborn''s
    colorblind palette. Three columns represent First, Second, and Third class passengers,
    with widths proportional to the number of passengers in each class. Each column
    is divided into two rectangles: blue for "Survived" (bottom) and yellow/orange
    for "Did Not Survive" (top). Rectangle heights represent conditional survival
    proportions within each class. Frequency counts are displayed as white bold text
    in the center of each rectangle (136, 87, 119 for survived; 80, 97, 372 for did
    not survive). The title follows the required format with spec-id, library, and
    pyplots.ai. Axis labels show "Passenger Class" (x-axis) and "Survival Status"
    (y-axis). A legend in the upper right identifies the color coding.'
