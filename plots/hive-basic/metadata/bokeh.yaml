review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot geometry with correct 3-axis radial layout
  - Smooth bezier curve edges provide visual clarity and reduce hairball effect
  - Color-coded axes with Python-inspired palette (blue, yellow, green) are visually
    appealing
  - Software dependency network context is realistic and educational
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels specified in code are not visible in rendered image - need larger
    text or different positioning
  - Degree legend in bottom-right is not rendering/visible in the output
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - plot occupies only ~40% of the 3600x3600
    space
  - Nodes appear relatively small for the high-resolution canvas
