review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological context with real gene names from different pathways (cell
    cycle, metabolism, immune, cancer)
  - Clear visual separation of tumor vs normal samples through clustering
  - Well-implemented diverging colormap (RdBu) centered at zero as spec requires
  - Both row and column dendrograms properly displayed and aligned with the heatmap
  - Clean label placement with angled sample labels avoiding overlap
  - Proper use of Ward's method with Euclidean distance as recommended in spec
  - Interactive HTML output also generated
  weaknesses:
  - Image dimensions (3950x2850) don't match target 4800x2700 specification
  - Axis labels (Samples, Genes) are set in code but not visible because axes are
    hidden
  - Text sizes could be increased for better readability at full resolution (title
    is 28pt but labels are 14pt instead of recommended 18pt+)
  - Manual dendrogram drawing is complex; code could be simplified
