review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using pygal XY chart with custom SVG injection for
    decision regions
  - Clear visualization of the moon-shaped decision boundary with proper color-coded
    regions
  - Good implementation of misclassified point markers with red X overlay
  - Well-designed legend showing all three marker types
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme
  - Proper use of sklearn make_moons dataset for realistic ML context
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function data_to_svg() breaks KISS principle slightly, though justified
    for coordinate mapping
  - Axis labels lack units (acceptable for synthetic ML data, but Feature 1 normalized
    would be better)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a decision boundary visualization with two
    moon-shaped class regions. The background is divided into two color zones: light
    blue (Class 0) and light yellow (Class 1), with a curved boundary between them
    following the characteristic moon pattern from sklearn''s make_moons dataset.
    Training points are overlaid as solid circles - blue circles for Class 0 and yellow
    circles for Class 1. Misclassified points are marked with red X symbols on top
    of their class-colored circles. The title "contour-decision-boundary · pygal ·
    pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Axis labels show "Feature 1" (x-axis) and "Feature
    2" (y-axis) with clear tick marks ranging from approximately -1.9 to 2.9 on x-axis
    and -1.4 to 2.0 on y-axis. A legend in the top-right corner shows Class 0, Class
    1, and Misclassified markers.'

        comment: Creative use of pygal's XY chart as a base with custom SVG injection
          to create decision boundary regions. This is an excellent workaround for
          pygal's limited contour capabilities.
  verdict: APPROVED
