review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of synchronized crosshair using Altairs selection_point
    with nearest=True
  - Clean declarative approach with vconcat for vertical stacking
  - Conditional opacity for hover highlighting across all three charts
  - Reference lines for overbought/oversold levels add domain context
  - Text annotations appear on hover showing exact values
  - Uses appropriate color scheme (Python blue, gold, green)
  weaknesses:
  - Date axis label is generic - could be more descriptive like Trading Date
  - The synchronized crosshair dashed gray rule may be hard to see
  - Could add proper tooltips instead of text marks for cleaner hover experience
  - No explicit zoom/pan interactivity added
  image_description: The plot displays a synchronized multi-chart dashboard with three
    vertically stacked charts sharing a common x-axis (date from Jan 2024 to Sep 2024).
    The top chart shows Price ($) as a blue line chart ranging from 0-120, with the
    line fluctuating between approximately 80-115. The middle chart displays Volume
    as yellow/gold vertical bars ranging from 0M-5M with varying heights throughout
    the time period. The bottom chart shows a Momentum Indicator as a green line ranging
    from 0-100, with red and green dashed horizontal reference lines at 70 (overbought)
    and 30 (oversold) levels. The indicator line shows significant variation, eventually
    dropping to near 0 at the end of the period. The main title "dashboard-synchronized-crosshair
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in a large font. All three charts
    have visible grids with subtle opacity, clear axis labels with appropriate fonts,
    and proper date formatting showing monthly intervals ("Jan 2024", "Feb 2024",
    etc.). Each chart has its own y-axis with independent scales appropriate for the
    data type (dollars for price, millions for volume, 0-100 for indicator).
