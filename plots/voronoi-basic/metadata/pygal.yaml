review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Voronoi diagram implementation with proper polygon clipping to bounding
    box
  - Creative workaround for pygal's lack of native Voronoi support using manual SVG
    construction with pygal's Style
  - Colorblind-safe palette with 20 distinguishable colors
  - Proper seed point markers with white borders for visibility
  - Good realistic context with facility location clusters (urban, industrial, suburban)
  - Interactive tooltips on cells and points via SVG title elements
  - High-resolution output suitable for publication
  weaknesses:
  - Code violates KISS principle by using multiple helper functions instead of flat
    structure
  - Legend positioned inside plot area could potentially overlap with data in different
    configurations
  image_description: The plot displays a Voronoi diagram partitioning a 2D plane into
    20 colored polygonal regions. The canvas has a light gray background with a white
    plot area. Each Voronoi cell is filled with a distinct color (including blue,
    yellow, orange, green, purple, pink, lavender, teal, gray, and others) at 60%
    opacity with dark gray borders. Seed points are shown as small circles with white
    outer rings and colored inner circles matching their respective cells. The title
    "voronoi-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. Axis
    labels show "X Coordinate (km)" and "Y Coordinate (km)" with tick marks at odd
    values 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. A dashed grid overlay helps with spatial reference. A legend
    in the upper right shows "Voronoi Cell" and "Seed Point" symbols with "n = 20
    points" notation. The plot is well-proportioned, filling most of the canvas with
    balanced margins.
