review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all specification requirements met perfectly (clear
    bin edges, y-axis at zero, readable labels, appropriate bin count)
  - 'Strong Bokeh idioms: ColumnDataSource, quad glyphs for histograms, HoverTool
    with formatted tooltips, dual PNG+HTML export'
  - Realistic and engaging data scenario (marathon finish times) with bimodal distribution
    showing histogram capabilities
  - 'Perfect code quality: clean KISS structure, reproducible seed, all imports used,
    no over-engineering'
  - All text sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for the 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: the bimodal distribution (main runners vs slower group)
    is interesting but not annotated — adding mean/median lines, distribution labels,
    or callout text would guide the viewer'
  - Aesthetic sophistication is at well-configured default level — could benefit from
    a more distinctive color treatment (e.g., gradient fill, or subtle color variation
    across bins) and a more polished title/subtitle hierarchy
  - Layout has minor wasted space — the plot could utilize more of the horizontal
    canvas area for a more impactful presentation
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of marathon finish times in minutes
    using muted steel-blue (#306998) bars with white edge lines separating each bin.
    The x-axis is labeled "Finish Time (min)" ranging from approximately 130 to 360
    minutes, and the y-axis shows "Frequency" from 0 to about 53. The title "histogram-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the upper left. The distribution is right-skewed
    with a primary peak around 240–250 minutes and a visible secondary shoulder around
    290–310 minutes, reflecting the bimodal data generation (two overlapping normal
    distributions). The background is clean white with subtle horizontal grid lines
    on the y-axis only. X-grid is hidden. Bars have no gaps between them. The overall
    layout is balanced with the plot filling most of the canvas.
