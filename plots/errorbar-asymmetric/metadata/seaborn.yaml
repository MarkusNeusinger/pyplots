review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements following the guidelines
    exactly
  - Clear demonstration of asymmetric error bars with visible caps as specified
  - Good data context (battery life) that clearly shows asymmetric uncertainty
  - Annotation explaining the error bar meaning (10th-90th percentile) as required
    by spec
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - The annotation box placement in the corner is functional but a proper legend entry
    might integrate better with the plot
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib for the core errorbar functionality rather than showcasing
    seaborn-specific features
  image_description: The plot displays an asymmetric error bar chart showing battery
    life measurements across 8 device models (Model A through Model H). The plot uses
    a consistent blue color (#306998) for both the scatter points and error bars.
    Each data point is represented by a large circular marker with vertical error
    bars extending asymmetrically above and below. The error bars have visible caps
    at both ends. The title follows the correct format "errorbar-asymmetric · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The x-axis shows "Device Model" with 8 categorical labels,
    and the y-axis shows "Battery Life (hours)" ranging from approximately 6 to 18.
    A subtle grid with dashed lines is visible in the background. An annotation box
    in the bottom-right corner explains "10th–90th percentile". The layout is clean
    with good use of whitespace and the whitegrid seaborn style.

        comment: While sns.scatterplot is used for the points, the core asymmetric
          errorbar functionality relies entirely on matplotlib's errorbar(). Seaborn
          doesn't have native asymmetric error bar support, so this is an acceptable
          compromise, but it doesn't showcase distinctive seaborn features.
  verdict: APPROVED
