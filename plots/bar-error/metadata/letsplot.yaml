review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with excellent text legibility at target resolution
  - Error bars have visible caps as required by the specification
  - Caption clearly explains what the error bars represent (95% CI)
  - Asymmetric error bars correctly implemented with ymin/ymax
  - Realistic A/B testing scenario with plausible conversion rate data
  - Proper use of ggplot2-style grammar of graphics
  weaknesses:
  - The alternating blue/yellow color scheme is decorative rather than informative;
    colors could encode a meaningful variable
  - Grid could benefit from a subtle alpha setting
