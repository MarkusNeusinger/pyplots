review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of histtype="step" to create clean outline-only histograms
  - Two overlapping distributions demonstrate the key advantage of step histograms
    (comparison without visual clutter)
  - Appropriate line width (3) makes steps clearly visible
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good contrast
  - Realistic temperature data scenario that is immediately understandable
  - Clean, minimal code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in upper right may overlap with data in some cases; consider
    upper left or outside plot
  - Both distributions have similar shapes (normal); varying the spread or adding
    a third distribution would better showcase the comparison capability
