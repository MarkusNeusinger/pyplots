review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent biological realism with chromosome-specific significant peaks mimicking
    real GWAS patterns (MHC region on chr6)
  - Clean visual design with alternating chromosome colors and clear significance
    thresholds
  - Proper handling of dense data with appropriate marker size and transparency
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Yellow highlighting of significant SNPs provides excellent visual emphasis
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis grid could be styled more subtly (current alpha=0.3 is slightly prominent)
  - Significant SNPs highlighting uses raw matplotlib instead of seaborn; could use
    a second scatterplot call for consistency
