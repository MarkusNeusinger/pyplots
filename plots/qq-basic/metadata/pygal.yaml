review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Beasley-Springer-Moro algorithm for calculating
    theoretical quantiles without scipy dependency
  - Clean, readable code structure with appropriate comments explaining the algorithm
  - 'Good choice of colors (blue #306998 for points, gray for reference) that are
    accessible and professional'
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart for scatter plot functionality
  - Reference line (y=x) is clearly visible and correctly implemented
  - Font sizes are well-scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Data demonstrates the key Q-Q plot feature of showing deviation from normality
    (right skew)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent; could benefit from more subtle styling
  - The inverse normal CDF calculation adds complexity; consider if scipy dependency
    would simplify the code
  - Marker size (dots_size=12) could be slightly larger for better visibility at this
    resolution
