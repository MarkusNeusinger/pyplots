review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-designed cluster markers showing count labels
  - Good use of letsplot layer_tooltips() for interactive hover information
  - Effective displacement algorithm prevents cluster overlap
  - Clean two-legend design (size and color) provides clear interpretation
  - Realistic store location data with meaningful categories
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function displace_overlapping_clusters violates KISS principle (could be
    inline or simplified)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered marker map of the continental
    United States showing store locations. A simplified gray polygon outlines the
    US boundaries. Cluster markers are displayed as filled circles with varying sizes
    representing the count of locations (from small clusters like 5-6 to large clusters
    like 131). Each cluster shows a white number inside indicating the count. The
    clusters are color-coded by dominant store type: blue for Retail (most common),
    yellow/gold for Warehouse, and red for Service Center. The map shows regional
    clusters: West Coast (99, 6, 74), Midwest (97), East Coast (131, 60, 5), Texas
    area (67, 6, 12, 25), and Florida (45, 22). Two legends appear on the right: a
    "Locations" size legend showing scale from 10-200, and a "Store Type" color legend.
    The title "map-marker-clustered · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, and
    a caption "Store locations clustered by proximity | Hover for details | 760 total
    locations" at the bottom.'
