review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 resolution (72px title,
    48px axis titles, 36px labels)
  - Clean implementation following library rules with inline Highcharts JS for headless
    Chrome compatibility
  - Proper use of Python Blue color with transparency (rgba 0.7) for overlapping point
    visibility
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Subtle dashed grid lines enhance readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual with units
  - Marker radius (18) could be slightly smaller for better distinction between nearby
    points
  - Does not leverage Highcharts tooltip/hover interactivity features visible in the
    static image
