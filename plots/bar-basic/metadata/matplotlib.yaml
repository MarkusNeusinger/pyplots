review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured to specification
    guidelines
  - Strong idiomatic matplotlib usage — bar_label with callable formatter, FuncFormatter
    for y-axis, axes-level API throughout
  - Clean, professional appearance with Python Blue, white bar edges, subtle grid,
    and removed spines
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format, value labels, and appropriate
    data mapping
  - Realistic, neutral business data context with good value variation
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: missing annotations or callouts to highlight insights (e.g.,
    Electronics leads at $45.2K or a highlight on the top/bottom performer)'
  - Canvas utilization could be improved — some wasted whitespace, plot could fill
    more of the available area
  - Dollar format lambda is duplicated between bar_label and FuncFormatter — could
    extract to a shared formatter
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" showing product sales by category. Six bars represent Electronics
    ($45,200), Clothing ($32,800), Home & Garden ($28,500), Sports ($38,700), Books
    ($18,900), and Toys ($24,100). All bars are rendered in a consistent dark blue
    (Python Blue #306998) with white edge highlights. Dollar-formatted value labels
    appear above each bar. The y-axis shows dollar-formatted tick labels from $0 to
    $50,000. The x-axis labels read "Product Category" with individual category names
    below each bar. A subtle y-axis grid (low alpha) provides reference lines. Top
    and right spines are removed for a clean look. The layout is a standard 16:9 landscape
    format with balanced whitespace.'

        comment: bar_label with lambda formatter is distinctive (matplotlib 3.4+);
          FuncFormatter is library-specific; good but not exceptional
