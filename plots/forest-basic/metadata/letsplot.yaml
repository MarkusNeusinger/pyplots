  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the forest plot structure with all required elements
    (point estimates, CIs, pooled diamond, null reference line)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with logical data organization
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar including geom_polygon for the diamond
    shape
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output (title 24pt, axis text 16pt, axis
    title 20pt)
  - Realistic meta-analysis data with meaningful variation in effect sizes and weights
  - Proper marker sizing proportional to study weight using scale_size_identity()
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size variation based on weight is subtle and could be more visually distinct
    (range of 2-10 is narrow)
  - Grid styling could be improved - currently using panel_grid_major_y=element_blank()
    but might benefit from subtle horizontal grid lines for readability
  - The plot could benefit from lets-plot interactive features like tooltips showing
    exact values on hover
  image_description: 'The forest plot displays 10 clinical trials (Johnson 2019 through
    Taylor 2022) arranged vertically and ordered by effect size from lowest to highest.
    Each study is represented by a blue square marker (point estimate) with horizontal
    blue lines extending to show 95% confidence intervals. A dashed gray vertical
    line at x=0 marks the null effect. At the bottom, a yellow diamond indicates the
    pooled estimate with the label "Pooled: 0.31 [0.15, 0.46]" shown beneath it. The
    title "forest-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The x-axis is
    labeled "Log Odds Ratio (95% CI)" and ranges from -0.5 to 1.0. Study names appear
    on the left y-axis. The overall color scheme uses blue (#306998) for study data
    and yellow (#FFD43B) for the pooled estimate diamond.'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar (geom_segment, geom_point, geom_polygon,
          geom_text), theme customization, and scale_size_identity; however, doesn't
          leverage lets-plot specific interactive features or tooltips
