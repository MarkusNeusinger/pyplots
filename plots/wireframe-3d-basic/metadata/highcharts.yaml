quality_score: 90
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of wireframe effect using scatter3d with line connections
  - Two-tone blue color scheme enhances depth perception of the mesh
  - Clear title following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  - Mathematical subtitle displaying the function formula
  - All three axes properly labeled with descriptive text and units
  - 'Good 3D viewing angle (alpha: 18, beta: 30) showing surface topology'
  - Proper canvas size (4800x2700) with good utilization
  weaknesses:
  - Z-axis tick labels and axis title overlap slightly in the lower right corner
  - Grid/legend score reduced as no visible gridlines on the 3D frame floor for spatial
    reference
