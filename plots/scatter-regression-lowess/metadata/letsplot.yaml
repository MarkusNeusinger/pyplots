review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent LOWESS implementation using geom_smooth with loess method and confidence
    band (se=True)
  - Perfect title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Realistic plant growth vs temperature scenario that naturally demonstrates LOWESS
    benefits
  - Good color contrast between blue points and yellow curve with appropriate transparency
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence band fill color (#FFD43B) same as line color - could use a lighter/different
    shade for better visual distinction
  - Some imports listed individually could be consolidated (minor style issue)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot with approximately 200 blue
    data points (#306998) representing plant growth rate vs temperature. A smooth
    yellow LOWESS curve (#FFD43B) is overlaid with a light yellow confidence band
    (se=True). The curve shows a clear non-linear relationship: growth rate increases
    from ~17 cm/day at 5°C to a peak of ~22 cm/day around 15-17°C, then gradually
    declines back to ~18 cm/day at 40°C. The title "scatter-regression-lowess · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" is properly formatted at the top. Axis labels include units: "Temperature
    (°C)" and "Growth Rate (cm/day)". The minimal theme provides a clean white background
    with subtle gray grid lines. Points have appropriate alpha (0.6) showing density
    while allowing the LOWESS curve to be clearly visible.'

          cm/day is on the high end but plausible for fast-growing plants

          theme_minimal(), element_text() for styling. Good usage but not exceptional
