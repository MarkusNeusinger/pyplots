review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular layout with 5 well-proportioned concentric arcs
  - Clean neutral data context using corporate departments
  - Proper random seed set for reproducibility
  - Good use of seaborn colorblind palette for accessibility
  - Clear legend with department names and seat counts
  - Helpful annotations for majority threshold and total seats
  - White edge borders on seats provide good visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some empty space below the baseline that could be better utilized
  - Title uses regular dots which work but could be improved
