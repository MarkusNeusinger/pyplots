review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - 'Good use of Bokeh distinctive features: ColumnDataSource and HoverTool for interactivity'
  - Clean KISS-style code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.7) for overlapping points
  - Realistic data scenario (study hours vs exam scores)
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels render as generic X Value/Y Value instead of descriptive labels -
    x_axis_label and y_axis_label parameters not being applied correctly
  - Y-axis scale shows 4-14 instead of expected 0-100 for exam scores - data scaling
    issue
  - Text sizes appear smaller than specified for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Grid lines barely visible despite grid_line_alpha=0.3 setting
  - Point size (28) appears small relative to the large canvas
