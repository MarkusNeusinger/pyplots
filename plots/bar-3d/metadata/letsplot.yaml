review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 3D isometric projection with clear depth perception using geom_polygon
    for bar faces
  - Good use of viridis color scale reinforcing z-values for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean separation of product categories and quarters with readable labels
  - Interactive tooltips provide rich data exploration when viewing HTML export
  - Well-structured code with proper depth sorting for correct face rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Product labels on left side appear stacked vertically rather than aligned with
    their corresponding bar rows in the 3D space
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D bar chart with an isometric perspective.
    The title "bar-3d · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top left. Twenty
    3D bars are arranged in a 5x4 grid representing quarterly sales (Q1-Q4) across
    five product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Sports, Books). Each bar
    uses the viridis color scale (purple→teal→green→yellow) to encode revenue values
    ranging from ~15M to 65M. The bars have three visible faces (front, top, right)
    with dark outlines creating clear 3D definition. A subtle gray floor grid provides
    depth reference. Product labels are stacked vertically on the left, quarter labels
    (Q1-Q4) appear along the front edge, and "Revenue ($M)" labels the z-axis. A color
    legend on the right maps the gradient to revenue values.

        comment: Good use of geom_polygon, layer_tooltips for interactivity, scale_fill_viridis,
          theme customization; could better utilize lets-plot's native grammar of
          graphics features
  verdict: APPROVED
