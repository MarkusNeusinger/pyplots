review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance - all six requirements from the specification are implemented
    (step ECDFs, K-S statistic, max distance highlight, p-value, legend, Y-axis range)
  - Strong annotation design with rounded box, arrow, and connectionstyle creating
    a polished look
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario with appropriate beta distributions producing
    visually distinct CDFs
  - Clean, well-structured code with no unnecessary complexity
  - Shaded gap region (fill_betweenx) adds visual emphasis to the K-S distance
  weaknesses:
  - Data storytelling is weak - both curves have equal visual weight with no hierarchy
    guiding the viewer to the key insight; consider adding contextual text or varying
    visual emphasis
  - Color accessibility could improve - while linestyle differentiation helps, the
    blue-red pair is not ideal for all forms of color vision deficiency; consider
    using blue and orange/amber
  - Axis label Credit Score (0-100) includes range but not units in the traditional
    sense; Cumulative Proportion could include (0-1) for completeness
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step functions on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. The "Good Customers"
    ECDF is rendered as a solid blue line (#306998) rising slowly from left to right,
    while the "Bad Customers" ECDF is a dashed red/coral line (#D4533B) that rises
    much more steeply. Both curves span from approximately 0 to 100 on the x-axis
    (Credit Score) and 0 to 1.0 on the y-axis (Cumulative Proportion). A dotted vertical
    line at approximately x=48 marks the maximum distance between the two CDFs, with
    two dark dots (white-edged) at the upper and lower endpoints. A light blue shaded
    rectangle highlights the gap region. A labeled annotation box reads "D = 0.722"
    with an arrow pointing to the midpoint of the distance line. The italicized text
    "p-value < 0.001" appears in the lower-right corner. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. The legend is placed in the
    upper left with a semi-transparent background. Top and right spines are removed,
    and subtle y-axis gridlines are visible.
