review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot layer_tooltips() with rich hover information (category
    title, revenue, percentage, units sold, YoY growth)
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate grid styling (only horizontal major grid
    lines)
  - Good currency formatting on y-axis using scale_y_continuous
  - Realistic business data scenario with multiple data dimensions
  - Proper 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scaling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme transitions from blue to yellow which is decorative rather than semantic;
    could consider a single-hue gradient or sequential palette
  - File handling boilerplate for lets-plot output directory could be cleaner
  image_description: The plot displays an interactive bar chart showing quarterly
    product sales revenue across 8 categories. Bars are arranged from highest (Electronics
    at ~$125,000) to lowest (Automotive at ~$28,000). The color scheme uses a gradient
    from dark blue (#306998) for higher values through lighter blues to yellow (#FFD43B/#FFDF5F)
    for the last two categories (Beauty, Automotive). The y-axis displays currency
    formatting with dollar signs ($0 to $130,000). X-axis labels are rotated at ~25
    degrees showing category names. A clean minimal theme is applied with subtle horizontal
    gray grid lines and no vertical grid. The title "bar-interactive · letsplot ·
    pyplots.ai" is displayed in bold at the top.
