review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of composite plot using ggbunch to combine dendrograms
    with heatmap
  - Creative solution using scipy for hierarchical clustering since lets-plot lacks
    native clustermap
  - Proper diverging colormap (blue-white-red) centered at zero for expression data
  - Good visual separation between cluster groups reveals biological patterns
  - Dendrograms properly aligned with heatmap through careful coordinate transformation
  - Realistic gene expression scenario perfect for demonstrating clustered heatmaps
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function get_dendrogram_segments() which violates the KISS no-functions
    principle
  - Gene labels on y-axis are slightly small (size=10) for optimal readability at
    full resolution
  - Legend is positioned somewhat far from the main heatmap due to ggbunch layout
    constraints
  image_description: The plot displays a clustered heatmap with gene expression data
    (20 genes × 15 samples). A column dendrogram at the top shows the hierarchical
    clustering of samples, with clear branching structure. A row dendrogram on the
    left shows the hierarchical clustering of genes. The heatmap uses a diverging
    red-white-blue colormap (RdBu) where red indicates high expression (up to ~4),
    white indicates neutral (0), and blue indicates low expression (down to ~-4).
    Gene labels (Gene_01 through Gene_20) appear on the y-axis, and sample labels
    (Sample_A through Sample_O) are shown on the x-axis rotated at 45 degrees. The
    title "heatmap-clustered · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. A legend
    on the right shows "Expression (z-score)" with the color scale. The clustering
    reveals clear patterns with distinct gene groups showing correlated expression
    patterns across sample clusters.
