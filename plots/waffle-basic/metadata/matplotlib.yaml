review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with rounded squares (FancyBboxPatch) giving a polished,
    modern look
  - Perfect color choices using Python blue/yellow plus colorblind-safe additions
  - Well-implemented 10x10 grid where each square = 1%, matching spec exactly
  - Clean legend with shadow and fancybox styling that is positioned appropriately
  - Correct title format following the pyplots.ai convention
  - Simple, readable KISS code structure without unnecessary complexity
  weaknesses:
  - Waffle charts benefit from a subtitle or annotation explaining what the data represents
  - Data could include a very small category to show how the chart handles edge cases
  - Could use additional matplotlib features like annotating total percentage per
    category on the chart
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 10x10 waffle chart with 100 rounded squares
    arranged in a grid. The chart uses four distinct colors: deep blue (#306998) for
    Product A occupying the bottom 42 squares (4.2 rows), golden yellow (#FFD43B)
    for Product B taking the next 28 squares (2.8 rows), bright green (#4DAF4A) for
    Product C with 18 squares, and pink (#E377C2) for Product D filling the top 12
    squares. Each square has subtle rounded corners and white gaps between them for
    visual separation. The title "waffle-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top in large clear font. A well-styled legend with a shadow effect
    is positioned to the right of the grid, showing each category with its percentage
    value (e.g., "Product A (42%)"). The layout is clean with good use of whitespace
    and the chart fills the canvas appropriately.'
