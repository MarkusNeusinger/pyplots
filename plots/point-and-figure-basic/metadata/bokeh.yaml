review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the P&F algorithm with proper box size and reversal
    logic
  - Clean, readable code with proper data generation including realistic trending
    periods
  - Good visual clarity with appropriately sized X and O markers
  - Both PNG and HTML exports for static and interactive viewing
  - Proper trend line implementation with 45-degree ascending/descending lines
  weaknesses:
  - Legend only shows trend lines, missing explanation of X (bullish) and O (bearish)
    meanings
  - Grid lines not at exact box size intervals as suggested in spec
  - Could add HoverTool for interactivity showing price/date information
  - Minor empty space on left side of chart
  image_description: The plot displays a Point and Figure chart with green "X" symbols
    representing bullish (rising price) columns and red "O" symbols representing bearish
    (falling price) columns. The chart shows 9 columns (numbered 0-8 on x-axis) with
    prices ranging from approximately 78 to 122 on the y-axis. A blue ascending support
    trend line starts from the lower left (~77) and slopes upward to the right (~95).
    A yellow descending resistance trend line starts from the upper left (~123) and
    slopes downward to the right (~105). The title reads "point-and-figure-basic ·
    bokeh · pyplots.ai". The legend shows "Support Trend" and "Resistance Trend" in
    the top left. The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines.
    The X and O markers are appropriately sized and bold, making them clearly distinguishable.
