review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm with physics simulation that produces tight,
    non-overlapping layout
  - Clear area-proportional scaling using sqrt transformation as specified
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual appeal
  - Well-formatted labels inside large bubbles with department name and budget
  - Proper use of Altair layering for circles and text
  - Interactive tooltips in HTML export provide additional context
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Small bubbles (HR, Legal, Security, QA) lack visible labels in the static PNG
    - only accessible via tooltips in HTML
  - No legend explaining what colors represent (even though colors are cyclic, a note
    would help)
  - The optional grouping feature from the spec could have been demonstrated to show
    clustering capability
