review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's native go.Candlestick for clean, idiomatic implementation
  - Proper teal/red color scheme that is more accessible than pure green/red
  - Realistic price simulation with appropriate volatility and trend behavior
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correctly disabled rangeslider for cleaner static output
  weaknesses:
  - Could enhance Plotly's distinctive hover tooltips with custom hovertemplate showing
    OHLC values
  - Grid visibility is good but could add annotation or subtitle explaining color
    meaning for first-time viewers
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 trading days
    of stock price data from January 2 to February 11, 2024. The chart uses teal/green
    (#26A69A) for bullish (up) candles and red (#EF5350) for bearish (down) candles.
    Each candlestick clearly shows the body (open-close range) and wicks (high-low
    range). The price starts around $100 and shows realistic market movement with
    an initial uptrend to ~$109, followed by a gradual decline to the $100-102 range.
    The title "candlestick-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. X-axis
    shows "Date" with appropriate date labels, Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from
    96 to 112. A subtle gray grid helps read price levels. The layout is clean with
    a white background.
