review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with multiple geom layers (geom_line,
    geom_vline, geom_segment, geom_point, geom_text)
  - Good color and shape encoding for different event types making them easily distinguishable
  - Smart alternating flag positioning algorithm to avoid visual clutter
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of scale_color_manual and scale_shape_manual for custom styling
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (alpha 0.3 instead of E0E0E0 which appears quite
    visible)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock price chart spanning from January
    2024 to September 2024, with the price ranging from approximately $115 to $165.
    The stock price is rendered as a thick blue line (#306998). Eight event flags
    are positioned throughout the chart with connector lines linking each flag marker
    to its corresponding date on the price line. Events are color-coded by type: blue
    squares for Earnings (Q4 Beat, Q1 Miss, Q2 Beat), green diamonds for Dividends
    (Div $0.50, Div $0.55), yellow triangles for News (New Product, Partnership),
    and a red circle for the Split (2:1 Split). The flags alternate above and below
    the price line to minimize overlap. Vertical dashed gray lines mark each event
    date. The title "stock-event-flags · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the
    top. A legend on the right side explains the event type symbols and colors. X-axis
    shows monthly dates (Jan 2024 through Sep 2024) with 45-degree rotation, Y-axis
    shows "Stock Price ($)" with values from ~115 to ~165.'
