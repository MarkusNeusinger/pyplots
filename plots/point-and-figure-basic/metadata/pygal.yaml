quality_score: 72
review:
  strengths:
  - Correct P&F algorithm implementation with proper box size and reversal logic
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (blue and coral instead of green/red)
  - Proper axis labeling with units
  - Title follows correct format
  - Grid lines at box size intervals as specified
  - Good data generation showing multiple reversals
  weaknesses:
  - Support and resistance trend lines are coded but not visible in output (pygal
    may not render them with show_dots=False)
  - Uses filled circle markers instead of actual X and O symbols as specified in the
    spec
  - Legend indicates X (Rising) but shows circles, creating inconsistency
  - Grid lines are too prominent (should be more subtle with lower alpha)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Point and Figure chart with 8 columns (0-7)
    on the X-axis labeled "Column (Reversal)" and price levels from $82 to $110 on
    the Y-axis labeled "Price ($)". Blue/teal circular markers represent X (Rising)
    columns and red/coral circular markers represent O (Falling) columns. The chart
    shows alternating bullish and bearish columns: column 0 is rising (blue, ~100-110),
    column 1 is falling (red, ~82-108), column 2 is rising (blue, ~84-94), column
    3 is falling (red, ~86-92), column 4 is rising (blue, ~88-92), column 5 is falling
    (red, ~82-90), column 6 is rising (blue, ~84-96), and column 7 is falling (red,
    ~86-94). The title correctly shows "point-and-figure-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai".
    A legend at the bottom shows "X (Rising)" and "O (Falling)". Grid lines are visible
    at each box size interval ($2). The support and resistance trend lines mentioned
    in the code are NOT visible in the rendered image.'
