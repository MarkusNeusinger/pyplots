review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of overfitting visualization with validation loss diverging
    from training loss after epoch 25
  - Clean use of Altair's layered composition with separate chart objects for lines,
    points, and annotations
  - Red diamond marker with annotation clearly indicates the optimal stopping point
    at minimum validation loss
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with strong contrast between blue training and yellow
    validation curves
  - Proper title format and axis labeling including loss function type as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Legend title "Curve Type" is generic; could be more descriptive
  - Points on every epoch (50 points per curve) add visual noise; could use opacity
    or fewer markers
  image_description: 'The plot displays two line curves on a white background with
    a subtle grid. The title "line-loss-training · altair · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top in large black text. The x-axis is labeled "Epoch" (ranging from 0
    to 50) and the y-axis is labeled "Cross-Entropy Loss" (ranging from 0.0 to 2.8).
    Two curves are shown: a blue line (Training Loss) starting at ~2.5 and exponentially
    decaying to ~0.15, and a yellow/gold line (Validation Loss) starting at ~2.7,
    decaying then showing overfitting behavior by rising slightly after epoch 25.
    A red diamond marker at approximately epoch 30 indicates "Min Val Loss (Epoch
    30)" with a red text annotation. The legend in the top-right corner shows "Curve
    Type" with Training Loss (blue) and Validation Loss (yellow). Points are marked
    along both lines.'
