review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with good use of pygal custom Style system
  - Value labels with dollar formatting enhance readability and practical use
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labels with units
  - Good bar spacing and proportions for a basic bar chart
  - Deterministic data with realistic retail sales scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently at default opacity)
  - Font sizes in the style are larger than library defaults but tick labels could
    be slightly larger for optimal legibility
