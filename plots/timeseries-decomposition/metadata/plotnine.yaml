review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine facet_wrap for creating the four-panel decomposition
    layout
  - Clean implementation using statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper time series
    analysis
  - Good color choice (#306998) that is accessible and professional
  - Proper handling of NaN values from decomposition edges
  - Correct categorical ordering of components using pd.Categorical
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - 12 years of monthly data provides meaningful decomposition
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels in the Original panel appear slightly crowded with multiple
    values stacked
  - Panel spacing could be reduced to make better use of vertical canvas space
  - Grid alpha at 0.5 could be more subtle (0.3 would be better)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked faceted panels on a 16:9 landscape layout. The main title "timeseries-decomposition
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. Each panel has
    a gray strip header showing the component name with numbering: "1. Original",
    "2. Trend", "3. Seasonal", and "4. Residual". All panels use a consistent blue
    (#306998) line color. The x-axis shows dates from 2012 to 2024 with 2-year intervals,
    and a shared "Date" label appears at the bottom. A shared "Value" label appears
    on the left y-axis. The Original panel shows time series data ranging from ~200
    to ~600 with clear upward trend and seasonal oscillation. The Trend panel shows
    a smooth increasing line from ~260 to ~540. The Seasonal panel shows a repeating
    sinusoidal pattern oscillating between approximately -25 and +25. The Residual
    panel shows random noise fluctuating roughly between -30 and +30. Light gray grid
    lines are visible in all panels. The background is minimal/white with subtle gray
    panel backgrounds.'

          Y-axis tick labels in the first panel are slightly compressed/overlapping
          due to many values.

        comment: Good use of canvas space with four panels; however, the panels are
          quite short vertically leaving significant white space between them.

        comment: Grid is subtle at alpha 0.5, but no legend is needed for this single-series
          plot. However, the grid could be slightly more subtle.

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with facet_wrap, theme customization,
          and scale_x_datetime. Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like
          annotate or custom scales.
