review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent real-world data: recognizable technologies mapped to plausible maturity
    rings create a coherent innovation strategy narrative'
  - Strong visual hierarchy through marker-size variation by ring (Adopt=280, Hold=130)
    and pastel ring fills, guiding the viewer from near-term to future
  - 'Complete spec compliance: all required features implemented including 270-degree
    arc, ring labels, sector headers, dual-encoded markers, legend, and ring background
    fills'
  - Colorblind-safe palette with dual encoding (color + marker shape) ensures accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Item labels at fontsize=9 are too small for the 3600x3600 output — increase to
    at least 12pt, and bump sector headers (15pt) and ring labels (14pt) closer to
    18-20pt
  - Label crowding in the dense inner rings (Adopt/Trial) causes near-overlaps, particularly
    Vision Transformers/AI Code Assistants and FinOps Tooling/Edge Computing — improve
    angular or radial spacing in crowded cells
  - Excessive white space above and below the chart — use bbox_inches=tight in savefig
    and/or reduce top/bottom margins to improve canvas utilization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree radial innovation radar chart
    on a white background. Four concentric rings represent time horizons labeled in
    italic bold text in the arc gap on the right: Adopt (innermost, light blue fill),
    Trial (light green fill), Assess (light yellow fill), and Hold (outermost, light
    pink fill). Four angular sectors divide the arc: AI & ML (upper-left), Cloud &
    Infra (lower-left), Data Engineering (bottom-center), and Security (right). Each
    sector has bold black header text along the outer edge. Twenty-two technology
    items are plotted as labeled markers within their respective sector and ring.
    Marker shapes encode sectors: blue circles (AI & ML), orange/gold squares (Cloud
    & Infra), teal diamonds (Data Engineering), and pink triangles (Security). Marker
    sizes decrease from inner to outer rings, providing visual hierarchy where near-term
    adoptions are most prominent. Each marker has a small white-background label (fontsize
    9). A legend box in the lower-right shows the four sectors with their colors and
    shapes. The title reads "radar-innovation-timeline · matplotlib · pyplots.ai"
    at the top in large text. There is noticeable white space above and below the
    chart area.'

        comment: Title at 24pt is good. Item labels at 9pt too small for 3600x3600.
          Sector headers (15pt) and ring labels (14pt) fall short of >=20pt guideline.

        comment: Minor label crowding in inner rings. Vision Transformers/AI Code

          marker shapes provides redundancy.

          axis labels appropriate for this chart type.

        comment: Marker size variation by ring creates visual hierarchy. Intuitive
          ring coloring progresses from calm blue to attention-drawing pink. Real
          technologies tell a coherent strategy story.
