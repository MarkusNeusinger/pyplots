review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic weekly cyclical pattern plus upward trend
    and noise — perfectly demonstrates area chart strengths
  - 'Good use of letsplot-specific features: layer_tooltips() with formatted hover
    information and HTML interactive export'
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.4) balances between showing the area weight and
    maintaining readability
  - Text sizing follows library guidelines perfectly (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starting at 0 creates substantial empty space below the data range (~4300-7600),
    compressing the visual representation of variation in the upper portion of the
    chart
  - Right edge Jan 31 label appears slightly clipped
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart titled "area-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai". The x-axis shows dates from Jan 01 to Jan 31 labeled "Date", and
    the y-axis shows "Daily Visitors" ranging from 0 to 8,000. The area beneath the
    line is filled with semi-transparent blue (#306998, alpha ~0.4) with a solid darker
    blue outline (line width 2). The data exhibits a clear cyclical weekly pattern
    (peaks and troughs every ~7 days) overlaid on an upward trend from ~5,000 to ~7,500
    visitors. Dashed light-gray gridlines aid value estimation. The theme is minimal
    with clean white background. The chart uses the full canvas width well in landscape
    orientation.
