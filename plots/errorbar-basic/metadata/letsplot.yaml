review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional visualization with proper error bar caps
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2 grammar with geom_errorbar and geom_point layering
  - Well-chosen experimental data scenario that perfectly illustrates error bar use
    case
  - Proper sizing for 4800x2700 output with appropriate text scaling
  - Good variation in error magnitudes across groups showcases the visualization purpose
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Measured Value (units) would be better)
  - Could demonstrate asymmetric error bars to show full feature coverage as mentioned
    in spec
  image_description: The plot displays a basic error bar chart with 5 experimental
    groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C, Treatment D) on the x-axis
    and "Measured Value" on the y-axis (range ~40-68). Each group shows a central
    blue point marker with vertical error bars extending above and below, featuring
    horizontal caps at both ends. The colors are a consistent blue (#306998) for both
    points and error bars. The title correctly displays "errorbar-basic · letsplot
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The background is clean white with subtle gray grid
    lines, using a minimal theme. The data shows variation across groups with Treatment
    B having the highest mean (~61) and largest error range, while Control has the
    lowest mean (~45).

        comment: Uses ggplot2-style grammar correctly with geom_errorbar and geom_point,
          but doesn't leverage advanced lets-plot features like tooltips or interactive
          elements
  verdict: APPROVED
