review:
  strengths:
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all required K-S test features are present and correct
    (ECDFs, D statistic, p-value, max divergence line)'
  - Thoughtful annotation design with green arrow, bordered box, and semi-transparent
    background pointing to the divergence
  - Credit scoring context is well-chosen and realistic, with beta distributions producing
    plausible separation
  - HTML export alongside PNG leverages Plotly interactive capability
  - Clean code structure with correct manual computation of the maximum divergence
    point
  weaknesses:
  - The maximum divergence region could be more visually emphasized — a shaded area
    (fill between the two curves at the divergence point) would strengthen the data
    storytelling
  - The two ECDF curves have equal visual weight; adding a subtle fill or shading
    under each curve could improve distinction and visual hierarchy
  - The annotation arrow points to the midpoint of the divergence line but the annotation
    box partially overlaps with the dashed line area — repositioning could improve
    clarity
  - Y-axis gridlines are present but very subtle; a slightly stronger grid or horizontal
    reference lines at 0.25/0.5/0.75 would aid readability
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step functions against a white background. The blue line (#306998)
    represents "Good Customers" and the orange-red line (#E8590C) represents "Bad
    Customers", with credit scores (0–100) on the x-axis and cumulative proportion
    (0–1) on the y-axis. The Bad Customers ECDF rises steeply and plateaus near 1.0
    by score ~55, while the Good Customers ECDF rises slowly and reaches 1.0 around
    score ~97. A green dashed vertical line marks the point of maximum divergence
    at approximately x=50, where the two curves are farthest apart. An annotation
    box with a green border and arrow displays "D = 0.804" and "p < 0.001". The legend
    in the upper-left corner lists all three trace labels. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · plotly · pyplots.ai". Y-axis has subtle gray gridlines; x-axis has no gridlines.
