review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine geom_smooth(method="lm", se=True) for built-in regression
    with confidence interval
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation with proper layer composition
  - 'All specification requirements met: R² prominently displayed, regression equation
    annotated, confidence band visible'
  - Good color contrast between blue points and yellow regression line
  - Appropriate data scenario (study hours vs exam score) directly from spec applications
  - Well-configured theme with proper font sizes for 4800×2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear slightly more visible than ideal despite alpha settings
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with linear regression showing
    the relationship between Study Hours (x-axis) and Exam Score in percentage (y-axis).
    Blue scatter points (~80 data points) are distributed across the plot showing
    a clear positive linear correlation. A golden/yellow regression line runs diagonally
    from bottom-left to top-right, with a semi-transparent yellow confidence band
    around it. The title "scatter-regression-linear · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. The regression equation (y = 5.26x + 43.53) and R² = 0.871 are annotated
    in the upper-left area. The background uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid
    lines. The layout is clean with good 16:9 proportions.

          `annotate()` for statistical text'
