review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_polygon and scale_fill_cmap
  - Effective use of theme_void for map-like appearance
  - Well-sized legend with clear labeling
  - Appropriate colorblind-safe Blues palette for sequential data
  weaknesses:
  - Not a true choropleth map - uses abstract rectangular grid instead of geographic
    shapes (countries/states/counties as spec requires)
  - Generic Value Index data context - should use realistic scenario like population
    density or economic indicators
  - Could leverage plotnine faceting or annotation features for richer visualization
  - Layout has excess whitespace at bottom of canvas
