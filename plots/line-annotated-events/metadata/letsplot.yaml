review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating y_offset heights for event labels prevents overlap
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar implementation with proper layering of geoms
  - Good color contrast between data line (blue) and event markers (red)
  - Appropriate figure sizing with scale=3 for high-resolution output
  - Data shows realistic growth pattern with trend, seasonality, and event impacts
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label says Day of Year 2024 but displays month names - should be consistent
