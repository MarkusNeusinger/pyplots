review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure with well-organized hierarchical data
  - Good use of seaborn modern API with hue parameter (avoiding deprecation warnings)
  - Realistic business context with geographic sales hierarchy
  - Value labels clearly positioned above bars
  - Proper breadcrumb navigation shown in subplot titles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Third subplot (Level 3: cities) is missing from the rendered output - only 2
    of 3 panels visible despite code creating 3'
  - Color palette in Level 2 (gray tones) has poor contrast - USA, Canada, Mexico
    all appear in similar gray shades
  - Click to drill down text is too subtle and positioned outside the plot area
  - No visual indicator (hover state or icon) showing columns are interactive
  image_description: 'The plot shows a hierarchical bar chart drilldown visualization
    with only 2 subplots visible instead of the 3 that should be rendered. The left
    panel "Level 1: All Regions" displays three bars for North America ($850M, blue),
    Europe ($620M, yellow), and Asia Pacific ($530M, blue). The right panel "Level
    2: All > North America" shows a drilldown into North America with USA ($480M,
    blue-gray), Canada ($220M, gray), and Mexico ($150M, dark gray). The main title
    "bar-drilldown · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. Each bar has value
    labels above it. The third panel showing "Level 3: All > NA > USA" with cities
    is missing from the rendered output, despite being present in the code.'
