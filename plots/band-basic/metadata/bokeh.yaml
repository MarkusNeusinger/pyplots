review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of growing uncertainty band that widens over time
  - Good color contrast between blue band and yellow center line (colorblind-safe)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Clean KISS code structure with appropriate font sizing for high-resolution output
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., "Time (s)" or "Value (units)")
  - Could use Bokeh native varea() glyph instead of patch() for cleaner band implementation
  - Legend text appears slightly small relative to the canvas size
  image_description: The plot shows a band plot with a light blue semi-transparent
    filled region representing a 95% confidence interval. A yellow/gold center line
    runs through the middle of the band representing the mean trend. The band starts
    narrow on the left (around x=0) and progressively widens toward the right (x=10),
    demonstrating growing uncertainty over time. The title "band-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top left. The x-axis is labeled "Time" (0-10) and y-axis is labeled
    "Value" (approximately 1-10). A legend in the top-left corner shows "95% Confidence
    Interval" and "Mean Trend". The background is white with subtle gray grid lines.
