review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (ribbon under
    line)
  - Confidence interval correctly widens over time demonstrating forecast uncertainty
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Proper figure sizing (16x9) and font scaling for high-resolution output
  - Legend clearly identifies both the confidence band and forecast line
  - Realistic business context (monthly sales forecast)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows two separate entries due to using both fill and color aesthetics
    - could be combined into single legend item
  - X-axis label Month lacks temporal context
