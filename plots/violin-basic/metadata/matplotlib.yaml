review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choice with four distinct distribution shapes including bimodal,
    showcasing violin plot strengths
  - Custom median-based color intensity creates subtle visual differentiation between
    schools
  - Clean code with good use of matplotlib violinplot parts dictionary for granular
    customization
  - 'All spec requirements met: quartile markers, mirrored density, median line'
  - Strong visual refinement with spine removal, subtle grid, and alpha blending
  weaknesses:
  - Data storytelling could be stronger - interesting patterns (bimodality, distribution
    differences) are not visually emphasized
  - School names are generic (A/B/C/D) rather than more memorable real-world names
  - White Q1/Q3 lines could be more visually distinct from the violin body
  - Monochromatic blue scheme with subtle median-based variation lacks visual punch
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes arranged horizontally for
    Schools A, B, C, and D. All violins use shades of blue (Python Blue #306998 base),
    with shade intensity varying by median value — darker blue for lower medians,
    lighter for higher. Each violin has mirrored KDE density on both sides. Inside
    each violin, white horizontal lines mark Q1 and Q3, while a yellow/gold line marks
    the median. Top and right spines are removed. A subtle y-axis grid (alpha 0.2)
    is visible. The x-axis is labeled "School" and y-axis "Test Score (points)". The
    title reads "violin-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". School A shows a normal
    distribution centered ~75, School B a tight cluster ~85, School C a wide spread
    centered ~62 extending down to ~30, and School D a bimodal shape with peaks near
    70 and 88.'
