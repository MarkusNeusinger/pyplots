review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with sort=-x for automatic sorting
  - Horizontal orientation improves label readability (follows spec recommendation)
  - Clean professional appearance with subtle grid styling
  - Proper font sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700 target)
  - Interactive HTML version with tooltips enhances usability
  - Rounded bar corners add visual polish
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling (dashed lines) is slightly more prominent than ideal; solid lines
    with lower opacity might be cleaner
  image_description: The plot shows a horizontal bar chart with 10 product categories
    sorted by sales in descending order. The bars are colored in Python Blue (#306998).
    The y-axis displays product names (Laptop, Smartphone, Tablet, Headphones, Smartwatch,
    Camera, Keyboard, Monitor, Speaker, Mouse from top to bottom). The x-axis shows
    "Sales (Units)" ranging from 0 to about 4,800. The title "bar-sorted · altair
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. A subtle dashed grid (light blue/gray)
    is visible behind the bars. The bars have rounded right edges. The layout is clean
    with good use of space.
