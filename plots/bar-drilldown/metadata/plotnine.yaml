review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of hierarchical drilldown concept using a static
    library
  - Clear breadcrumb-style navigation labels showing the drill path
  - Good use of geom_segment for drill arrow connecting parent to child view
  - Clean color scheme with Americas children using a gradient of blues
  - Value labels clearly positioned above bars
  - Appropriate realistic business data context
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows all 8 categories mixed together which is confusing
  - No visual indicator that bars are clickable (though understandable for static
    library)
  image_description: The plot displays a hierarchical bar chart showing sales data
    by region with a drilldown into the Americas breakdown. On the left side, four
    regional bars are shown (Americas=720, Asia Pacific=713, Europe=610, MEA=220)
    in blue, green, yellow, and orange respectively. On the right side, four country
    bars show the Americas breakdown (USA=450, Canada=120, Brazil=85, Mexico=65) in
    various shades of blue. A dashed gray arrow connects the Americas bar to the USA
    bar, indicating the drill path. Section labels at the top read "1. All Regions"
    and "2. Americas → Countries" in blue text, simulating breadcrumb navigation.
    The title follows the correct format. Value labels appear above each bar in dark
    gray bold text. A legend on the right shows all category colors. The Y-axis is
    labeled "Sales ($ millions)" with gridlines at 200-unit intervals.
