review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent domain-specific implementation with realistic Basquin equation modeling
  - All three material property reference lines clearly labeled with values
  - Appropriate log-log scaling as required by specification
  - Good visual hierarchy with zorder control for layering
  - Region annotations help explain the S-N curve behavior
  - Professional scatter plot styling with edge highlighting
  weaknesses:
  - Legend font size (14) slightly smaller than recommended (16)
  - Could use fill_between to shade the infinite life region below endurance limit
  image_description: 'The plot displays an S-N curve (Wöhler curve) with a log-log
    scale. The x-axis shows "Number of Cycles to Failure (N)" ranging from 10² to
    10⁸, and the y-axis shows "Stress Amplitude (MPa)" ranging from 2×10² to 6×10².
    Blue circular markers with white edges represent test data points showing scatter
    typical of fatigue testing. A yellow solid line represents the Basquin fit curve
    showing the inverse relationship between stress and cycles. Three horizontal dashed
    reference lines are included: red for Ultimate Strength (500 MPa), orange for
    Yield Strength (350 MPa), and green for Endurance Limit (200 MPa). Gray italic
    annotations label the three fatigue regions: "Low-Cycle Fatigue" (upper left),
    "High-Cycle Fatigue" (center), and "Infinite Life" (lower right). The legend is
    positioned in the upper right with a semi-transparent background. The title follows
    the required format "sn-curve-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
