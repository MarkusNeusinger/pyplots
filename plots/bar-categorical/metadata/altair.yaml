review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with automatic count aggregation via
    count():Q
  - Smart sorting by count descending using sort="-y" as suggested in spec
  - Tooltips add interactivity for the HTML output
  - Rounded bar corners add visual polish
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate font sizes and label angles for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Category frequency distribution could show more extreme variation to better demonstrate
    the counting feature (e.g., one very rare category)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing retail transaction
    counts across 6 product categories. The bars are rendered in a pleasant blue color
    (#306998) with subtle rounded corners at the top. Categories are displayed on
    the x-axis with labels angled at -30 degrees for readability: Electronics (42),
    Clothing (34), Home & Garden (27), Books (19), Sports (16), and Toys (12). The
    bars are sorted in descending order by count. The y-axis shows "Number of Transactions"
    ranging from 0 to 44. The title "bar-categorical · altair · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top center. The layout is clean with subtle gray gridlines and good use
    of canvas space.'
