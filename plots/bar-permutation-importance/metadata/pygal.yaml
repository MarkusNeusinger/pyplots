review:
  strengths:
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seeds
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for consistent visual appearance
  - Tooltips include standard deviation information which partially addresses error
    bar requirement
  - Feature names properly formatted with title case
  - Appropriate canvas size and font sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing horizontal error bars to show importance variability across shuffles (spec
    requirement)
  - Missing sequential color gradient mapped to importance values (spec requirement)
  - Missing vertical reference line at x=0 (spec requirement)
  - Many features showing 0.0000 importance makes lower half of chart visually sparse
