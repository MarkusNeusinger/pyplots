review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to render phylogenetic tree structure
  - Excellent choice of primate evolution as realistic scientifically meaningful example
  - Good colorblind-friendly palette for species markers
  - Properly proportional branch lengths showing evolutionary distances
  - Includes scale bar for reference
  weaknesses:
  - Species names only appear in legend, not directly labeled at tree tips
  - Scale bar rendered as legend item rather than standalone annotation
  - Tree structure appears vertically compressed with uneven species distribution
  - Dot sizes for species markers could be larger for better visibility
