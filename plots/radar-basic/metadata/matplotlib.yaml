review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib polar projection for radar chart creation
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color scheme with Python official colors (blue/yellow)
  - Clear comparison of two employee profiles with meaningful performance differences
  - Filled polygons with appropriate transparency (0.25) showing overlap visibility
  - 'All spec requirements implemented: gridlines at intervals, closed polygons, legend,
    distinct colors'
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Square figure size (12x12) appropriate for radar charts
  weaknesses:
  - Data is deterministic but lacks explicit seed comment for clarity
  - Radial tick labels positioned inside could be clearer if positioned outside or
    rotated
