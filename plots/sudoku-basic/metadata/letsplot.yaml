quality_score: 93
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with thick/thin grid lines clearly distinguishing 3x3
    boxes from individual cells
  - Clean monochrome design perfectly matches spec requirement for print-friendly
    output
  - Numbers are bold, large, and well-centered in cells for easy readability
  - Square aspect ratio (1:1) is ideal for Sudoku grid presentation
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics with geom_segment for lines and geom_text
    for numbers
  weaknesses:
  - Pandas import is unnecessary; simple Python lists/dicts would suffice and reduce
    dependencies
  image_description: The plot displays a 9×9 Sudoku grid with a clean black-and-white
    design. The title "sudoku-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in
    bold black text. The grid shows thick black lines separating the nine 3×3 boxes,
    with thinner gray lines dividing individual cells within each box. Numbers 1-9
    are displayed in bold black font, centered in their respective cells. Empty cells
    are shown as blank (no zeros displayed). The puzzle contains a partially filled
    standard Sudoku with numbers like 5,3 in the top-left, 7 in the top-middle area,
    etc. The overall layout is square (1:1 aspect ratio) with the grid well-centered
    and utilizing good canvas space. The monochrome design is clean and suitable for
    printing.
