review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of rug plot concept with trimodal data showing clustering
    patterns and gaps
  - Clean, minimal design with hidden y-axis appropriate for 1D distribution visualization
  - Helpful annotations explaining each cluster characteristics (density, spread,
    sample size)
  - Good use of alpha transparency for overlapping tick marks
  - Proper font sizing following matplotlib guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Measurement Value lacks units (e.g., Measurement Value (ms) or similar
    context)
  - Could demonstrate outlier detection capability mentioned in the spec
  - Basic vlines implementation rather than matplotlib more specialized options
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic rug plot with vertical blue tick marks
    (#306998) along a horizontal axis ranging from 10 to 90. The title "rug-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in black text. Three clusters of
    tick marks are visible: a dense cluster around value 25 (labeled "Dense cluster
    (n=50)"), a wider spread cluster around value 55 (labeled "Wider spread (n=35)"),
    and a small group around value 75 (labeled "Small group (n=15)"). The x-axis is
    labeled "Measurement Value". The y-axis is hidden, with only the bottom spine
    visible. Annotations in blue text above each cluster explain the data distribution.
    The layout is clean with good use of whitespace.'

        comment: Uses ax.vlines() which is appropriate but basic; could leverage matplotlib's
          EventCollection or rugplot-specific methods for a more idiomatic implementation
