review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Good use of Highcharts packedbubble chart type with simulation layout
  - Realistic data scenario (software project structure with lines of code)
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  weaknesses:
  - 'Wrong chart type: Uses packedbubble (flat grouped bubbles) instead of true circle
    packing with nested hierarchy - spec requires nested circles where each circle
    contains smaller circles representing its children'
  - Poor canvas utilization (~35%) - bubbles clustered in center with large empty
    margins
  - 'Constants node (value: 800) is filtered out and not displayed due to dataLabels
    filter'
  - No visual representation of hierarchy depth - all nodes appear at same level
  - Legend is placed far from the chart area in top-right corner
