review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's declarative grammar with mark_arc and explicit angle
    calculations
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with 12 distinct, well-chosen colors
  - Proper radial gridlines with concentric circles aid value estimation
  - Correct starting position at 12 o'clock for time-based data
  - Interactive tooltips add value for the HTML output
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Chart positioned in upper portion of canvas with significant empty whitespace
    below; should center the rose chart vertically or increase its size to better
    utilize the 16:9 canvas
  - Value labels on smaller segments (22, 28, 30, 35) are somewhat crowded together
