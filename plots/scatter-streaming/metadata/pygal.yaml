review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of color gradient from light to dark blue showing data age
  - Point size progression (smaller for older, larger for newer) reinforces streaming
    concept
  - Clean inverse correlation pattern between temperature and humidity is realistic
  - Good axis labels with proper units
  - Legend placed at bottom avoids data overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is too small to read clearly at full resolution
  - Could add tooltip content for interactive HTML version to show exact values
  - The streaming effect could be more dramatic with opacity/alpha variation (though
    pygal has limitations here)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter visualization of temperature (°C)
    on the x-axis (range 15-35) versus humidity (%) on the y-axis (range 30-80). The
    data shows a clear negative correlation between temperature and humidity, with
    150 points grouped into 5 age bins representing time windows. Colors range from
    light blue (#a8c8e8) for older data (240-300s ago) to dark blue (#1a4d6e) for
    newest data (0-60s ago). Point sizes increase with recency, effectively conveying
    the streaming concept. The legend at the bottom displays all 5 time window labels
    horizontally. Grid lines are subtle and aid readability. The title correctly follows
    the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format.
