review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format and text sizing throughout
  - Well-implemented hover templates with informative formatting
  - Clear annotation highlighting the key 10% lift metric
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic customer response model scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible for better
    readability
  - Marker density in early percentages could be reduced for cleaner visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a lift curve with a blue line ("Model Lift")
    showing cumulative lift ratio on the Y-axis (ranging from 0 to ~2) against percentage
    of population targeted on the X-axis (0-100%). A dashed yellow/gold horizontal
    line at y=1 represents the "Random Selection" baseline. The lift curve starts
    high (~1.8x) at low percentages and gradually decreases toward 1 as the percentage
    approaches 100%. An annotation box with an arrow points to the 10% mark, showing
    "Top 10%: 1.6x lift". The title "lift-curve · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The legend is positioned in the upper right corner. The background
    is clean white with subtle gray gridlines.'
