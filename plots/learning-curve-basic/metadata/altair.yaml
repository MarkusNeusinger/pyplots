review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen font sizes and line thickness
  - Perfect colorblind-safe color palette (Python blue and gold)
  - Proper confidence bands using mark_area with appropriate opacity
  - Clean, declarative Altair code following library idioms
  - Realistic simulated data showing classic learning curve behavior
  weaknesses:
  - Legend configuration uses resolve_legend which creates duplicate legend behavior
  - Missing interactive features (tooltips, hover) for exploring exact values
  - Y-axis scale could be tighter to better show validation curve detail
