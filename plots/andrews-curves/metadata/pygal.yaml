quality_score: 84
review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Andrews curve Fourier transformation formula implementation
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with high contrast between species
  - Proper data normalization (z-score standardization) as specified in notes
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.4) to reveal density patterns
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text and markers at bottom are too small and poorly positioned, reducing
    readability
  - Font sizes could be increased further for better legibility at full resolution
  - No distinctive pygal features utilized (interactive tooltips, custom hover effects)
