review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of split violin concept using areasplinerange series
  - Clean visual separation between Remote (blue) and Office (yellow) groups with
    colorblind-safe palette
  - Median markers (white diamonds) provide useful statistical reference points
  - Realistic and meaningful data scenario (employee satisfaction by work arrangement)
  - Proper KDE computation with Gaussian kernel and Silverman's rule of thumb for
    bandwidth
  - Good use of inverted chart to achieve horizontal violin orientation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines on the satisfaction score axis would improve readability
  - Image height is 2561px instead of the expected 2700px (aspect ratio slightly off)
  - Median markers could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
