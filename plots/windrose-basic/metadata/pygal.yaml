review:
  strengths:
  - Effective cumulative stacking approach creates proper wind rose visual representation
  - Cool-to-warm color progression follows meteorological convention for wind speeds
  - Realistic wind data generation with Weibull distribution and prevailing SW/W winds
  - Correct 8-direction sector binning with proper angular calculations including
    North wraparound
  - Clean, readable code structure with helpful comments
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is too small and positioned too far from chart, reducing readability
  - Innermost calm wind layer (0-3 m/s) is barely visible in most directions
  - Direction labels around the perimeter could be larger for better readability
  - Chart not centered well on canvas - noticeable empty space on left side
