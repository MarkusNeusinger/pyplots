review:
  strengths:
  - Clean minimalist design appropriate for sparkline visualization
  - Good use of pygal cubic interpolation for smooth curves
  - Area fill under line adds visual weight without distraction
  - Appropriate canvas utilization with plot filling the space well
  - Deterministic data representing realistic daily sales scenario
  - Per-point styling attempted for min/max/first/last highlighting
  weaknesses:
  - Legend should be hidden (show_legend=False) - sparklines are meant to be pure
    visualization without any chrome
  - Min/max yellow highlight dots are not visible in the final render - the node styling
    may not be working as intended
  - Data is monotonically increasing with only minor dips - would benefit from more
    varied trend showing both growth and decline periods
