review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized lines (linewidth=3.5) and readable
    text at all sizes
  - Three models demonstrating different performance levels (excellent, good, fair)
    provides comprehensive feature coverage
  - Proper inclusion of diagonal reference line for random classifier baseline
  - AUC values displayed prominently in legend with proper formatting
  - Good use of fill_between to emphasize area under curves
  - Colorblind-accessible color palette (blue, yellow, green)
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains helper functions (compute_roc and compute_auc) which violates the
    KISS principle - should be inline computation or use sklearn
  - Legend placement in lower right corner slightly crowds the curve convergence area
  - Axis labels lack explicit mention that these are rates/proportions (though standard
    for ROC curves)
