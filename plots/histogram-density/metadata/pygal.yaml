review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal distribution data that clearly demonstrates density histogram
    concept
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Well-formatted title following the required convention
  - Good use of pygal Style class for comprehensive customization
  - Appropriate axis labels with descriptive units
  - Smart x-label spacing (every 5th label) prevents overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests adding a reference line or theoretical PDF overlay for context,
    which is not implemented
  - Could use pygal native Histogram chart type instead of Bar chart for more semantic
    correctness
  image_description: The plot displays a density histogram with blue bars on a white
    background. The title "histogram-density · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score" with values ranging from approximately
    40 to 95, with labels shown at intervals (40, 52, 64, 76, 88). The y-axis is labeled
    "Density (Probability per Unit)" with values from 0 to approximately 0.034. The
    histogram clearly shows a bimodal distribution with two peaks - one around score
    65 and another around score 80-82, which aligns with the generated bimodal test
    score data. Horizontal grid lines are visible at subtle intervals. The bars are
    rendered in Python Blue (#306998) with slight transparency.

        comment: Title, axis labels, and tick marks are all clearly readable. Font
          sizes are well-scaled for the 4800x2700 canvas. Slight deduction as y-axis
          tick labels are somewhat small.

        comment: Y-axis grid is visible but no legend present (acceptable since single
          series with show_legend=False). Grid is subtle.

        comment: Uses pygal's Style customization, Bar chart with custom tooltips
          via label dictionaries. Could leverage more pygal-specific features like
          built-in tooltips or animations.
