review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout implementation that creates
    clear, natural cluster separation
  - Effective use of plotnine grammar of graphics to layer edges below nodes
  - Good visual distinction between internal edges (solid gray) and cross-department
    bridges (dashed)
  - Node sizing by degree successfully highlights hub nodes with more connections
  - Edge thickness varies by weight as specified
  - Realistic team collaboration scenario demonstrates force-directed graph use case
    perfectly
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate white background and hidden axes
  weaknesses:
  - Legend sorts departments alphabetically rather than by spatial position or logical
    grouping
  - Yellow color for Design department may have lower contrast against white background
