review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular seat arrangement algorithm that properly distributes seats
    across concentric arcs
  - Clean visual design with white marker borders that distinguish individual seats
  - Proper horizontal legend with seat counts for each party
  - Smart use of Plotly hover templates for interactivity
  - Majority threshold line adds context as specified
  - Total seats annotation at center is a nice touch
  - Neutral fictional party names avoid political controversy
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - The majority threshold dashed line is quite faint (rgba 0.3 alpha); could be slightly
    more visible while remaining subtle
