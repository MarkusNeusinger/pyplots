review:
  strengths:
  - Clean and professional visual appearance with well-styled legend (shadow, fancybox)
  - Excellent use of seaborn theming capabilities (set_theme, set_context) for consistent
    aesthetics
  - Percentage labels are bold white text with good visibility against colored slices
  - The exploded TechCorp slice effectively draws attention to the market leader
  - Realistic market share scenario that matches the spec application examples
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate multiple exploded slices (spec says 1-3 slices can be exploded)
    to show full feature range
  - Square figsize (12, 12) may not be optimal - standard 16:9 or defined square format
    could improve canvas utilization
  - The seaborn library is primarily used for styling rather than core plotting (acceptable
    since seaborn has no native pie chart)
