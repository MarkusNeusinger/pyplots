review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of notch=True with patch_artist for visually distinct, colored boxes
  - 'Thoughtful data design: Engineering vs Support shows non-overlapping notches
    (significant difference), Sales vs Marketing shows overlapping notches (no significant
    difference) - perfectly demonstrates the spec purpose'
  - Helpful annotation explaining what non-overlapping notches mean for statistical
    interpretation
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate font sizes and subtle grid
  - Explicit outliers in Support department showcase the outlier detection feature
  - Colorblind-safe palette starting with Python blue
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units for full clarity (e.g., Performance Score (0-100))
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 notched box plots representing employee
    performance scores across departments (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Support,
    HR). Each box has a distinct color: Engineering (Python blue #306998), Sales (yellow),
    Marketing (teal/cyan), Support (coral/red), and HR (light green). The notches
    around the medians are clearly visible, showing the 95% confidence intervals.
    The title "box-notched · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is at the top. Outliers are
    shown as gray circular points - visible for Sales (2 outliers ~43-52), Support
    (4 outliers including low ones at ~32-35 and high ones ~95-100). The y-axis shows
    "Performance Score" ranging from ~30-100, and x-axis shows "Department". A helpful
    annotation with an arrow points to Engineering''s box explaining that non-overlapping
    notches suggest significant difference in medians. Grid lines are subtle on the
    y-axis only.'
