review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color scheme using consistent hue families (blue gradients for Engineering,
    yellow for Marketing, etc.) that clearly show parent-child relationships
  - Clean separation between inner and outer rings with appropriate sizing (inner
    20-45%, outer 55-85%)
  - Professional title format with informative subtitle explaining the ring hierarchy
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario with plausible department/expense values
  - Good use of Highcharts PieSeries configuration for nested donut effect
  - HTML output also generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring labels (especially smaller segments like Software, CRM Tools)
    could benefit from larger font sizes for better readability at full resolution
  - Spec suggests using a legend for smaller segments, but legend is disabled; this
    is a minor deviation from spec guidance
