review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of seaborn heatmap with all key parameters: annot, fmt, cmap, center,
    vmin/vmax, square, linewidths'
  - Automatic text contrast (white on dark, dark on light) improves readability significantly
  - Financial correlation matrix provides realistic, meaningful context that demonstrates
    the plot type perfectly
  - Square aspect ratio is ideal for correlation matrices
  - Diverging colormap centered at 0 correctly represents positive/negative correlations
  weaknesses:
  - Missing axis titles (e.g., Asset Class for both axes) would add context
  - Colorbar could have more intermediate tick values for precision reading
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 7x7 correlation matrix heatmap showing relationships
    between financial asset classes: Stocks, Bonds, Gold, Real Estate, Crypto, Commodities,
    and Cash. The heatmap uses a diverging RdBu_r colormap with dark red indicating
    strong positive correlations (+1.0), white/light for near-zero correlations, and
    dark blue for strong negative correlations (-1.0). Each cell contains bold white
    or dark text annotations showing the correlation coefficient to 2 decimal places.
    The text color automatically contrasts with the background - white text on dark
    cells, dark text on light cells. The diagonal shows perfect 1.00 correlations
    (dark red). A vertical colorbar on the right shows the correlation scale from
    -1.0 to 1.0. The title "heatmap-annotated · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears in bold
    at the top. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees for readability. Cell gridlines
    are thin white separators.'
