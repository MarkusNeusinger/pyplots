review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and clear color contrast
  - Realistic temperature forecast scenario that demonstrates the plot type perfectly
  - Widening confidence interval over time shows thoughtful data modeling
  - Clean implementation following KISS principles
  - Proper use of toself fill for creating the confidence band polygon
  - Good use of semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.25) as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in upper-left overlaps slightly with the confidence band at its peak
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates to show exact
    values on mouseover
