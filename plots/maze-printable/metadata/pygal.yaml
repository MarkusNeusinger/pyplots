review:
  strengths:
  - Creative adaptation of pygal Dot chart to render a maze grid
  - Excellent DFS maze generation algorithm ensuring single solution path
  - Clean black-and-white print-friendly design
  - Proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Missing S (start) and G (goal) markers as specified in the spec
  - Title font size could be larger relative to the large canvas
  - Dot chart approach results in circular walls rather than solid lines (less traditional
    maze appearance)
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 maze puzzle rendered using pygal's
    Dot chart. Black dots represent walls arranged in a grid pattern on a white background.
    The maze has a clear entrance at the top-left (opening in the border) and exit
    at the bottom-right (opening in the border). The maze structure shows interconnected
    passages formed by the absence of dots, creating a solvable path. The title "maze-printable
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in a clean, readable font. The overall
    design is black-and-white, print-friendly, with the maze filling the canvas well
    and good margins around the edges.
