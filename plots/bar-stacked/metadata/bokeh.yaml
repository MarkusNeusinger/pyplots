review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled font sizes for the 4800×2700
    canvas
  - Clean stacking implementation with white borders between segments for clarity
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and HoverTool for interactivity
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with distinct hues
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful data variation across quarters
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left slightly crowds the upper y-axis tick labels
  - Missing total value labels above each stack (mentioned in spec notes as consideration)
  - Data is hardcoded rather than using random generation with seed
