review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent compositional layout using vconcat/hconcat for proper marginal plot
    arrangement
  - Good use of shared axis domains ensuring perfect alignment between scatter and
    marginals
  - Interactive brush selection on scatter points with tooltips enhance user experience
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate marker size and opacity for 150 data points
  - Consistent color scheme throughout all plot elements
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid on the main scatter plot (spec mentions revealing density
    patterns)
  - Brush selection is decorative - does not filter/update marginal histograms (missed
    opportunity for linked interactivity)
  - Right marginal histogram shows Y-axis tick labels which creates slight visual
    redundancy
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart with marginal distribution
    histograms in the classic layout: main scatter plot in the lower-left, top histogram
    for X distribution, right histogram for Y distribution. The scatter shows ~150
    data points in Python blue (#306998) with 0.65 opacity, demonstrating a clear
    positive linear correlation. X-axis labeled "X Value (units)" ranges roughly 0-90,
    Y-axis labeled "Y Value (units)" ranges roughly 0-110. Both marginal histograms
    use matching blue bars with 0.5 opacity, showing approximately normal distributions.
    The title "scatter-marginal · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top
    in appropriately large font. The axes of marginal plots align well with the main
    scatter plot axes. Layout is clean with no overlapping elements.'

        comment: Uses vconcat/hconcat composition, interactive brush selection, tooltips,
          and declarative encoding - good use of Altair's compositional grammar, but
          brush selection doesn't update marginal histograms (would require transform_filter)
  verdict: APPROVED
