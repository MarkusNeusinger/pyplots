review:
  strengths:
  - Inline Kaplan-Meier calculation with Greenwood formula for CI (KISS principle
    followed)
  - Excellent colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme with good contrast
  - 'Proper step function implementation using Highcharts step: left option'
  - Confidence interval bands correctly implemented with AreaRangeSeries and appropriate
    transparency
  - Censored observation markers now visible as diamond shapes on the curves
  - Realistic clinical trial data with meaningful difference between treatment groups
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in middle-left area potentially overlapping with data visualization
    region
  - Censored markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at the high resolution
