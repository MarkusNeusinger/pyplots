review:
  strengths:
  - Good canvas utilization with large 3600x3600 square format - pie chart fills significant
    portion of canvas
  - Clear hierarchical data structure representing realistic company expense breakdown
    (Operations, Marketing, Research, HR)
  - Labels are legible with white text on colored slices showing name, value, and
    percentage
  - Includes breadcrumb navigation text and click indicator for interactive functionality
  - Uses colorblind-friendly palette with good contrast between adjacent slices
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Only two colors visible (green and red) - the yellow from the color palette is
    not appearing, limiting color differentiation between categories
  - Red and green adjacency is not ideal for colorblind users despite being different
    shades
  - The Human Resources slice label text is partially difficult to read due to smaller
    slice size and label positioning
