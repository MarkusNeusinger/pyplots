review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using sns.lineplot with units parameter to draw individual
    arrow segments
  - Clean implementation of arrowheads using trigonometric calculations
  - Viridis colormap with colorbar effectively shows magnitude variation
  - Proper aspect ratio (equal) for vector field visualization
  - Well-scaled arrows that do not overlap but remain visible
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be X Position (units) or similar context-specific
    labeling)
  - Data context is purely mathematical rather than tied to a real-world application
    (e.g., wind field, fluid flow)
