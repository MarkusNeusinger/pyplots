review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular layout with 5 concentric arcs
  - Clean legend placement with party names and seat counts
  - Good visual balance with majority threshold line annotation
  - White edge borders on seats provide good visual separation
  - Proper title format following spec conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Data context uses political parties which violates content policy (should use
    neutral scenario like committee composition or board members)
  - No random seed set for reproducibility (np.random imported but seed not set)
  - Seaborn is used only for styling (set_style, set_context) but the actual plotting
    uses matplotlib scatter - this does not leverage seaborn distinctive plotting
    features
  - Color palette includes red and green which may not be fully colorblind-safe
