review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Bokeh native linked selection via shared ColumnDataSource
  - Four coordinated views exceeding the spec requirement of 2-3 views
  - Well-implemented CustomJS callbacks to update histogram and bar chart on selection
  - Clear Selection button provides good UX for resetting views
  - Proper use of selection_color, selection_alpha, and nonselection_alpha for visual
    feedback
  - Color-consistent encoding across all views
  weaknesses:
  - Text sizes could be slightly larger for the high-resolution canvas
  - Histogram uses single color instead of showing category breakdown with colors
  - Small Bokeh toolbar icons in top-right corner may be hard to see at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2x2 grid layout with four coordinated views.
    Top-left: A scatter plot titled "Scatter Plot - Use Box Select or Lasso to Select
    Points" showing Sepal Length (cm) on x-axis vs Sepal Width (cm) on y-axis with
    150 data points in three distinct color-coded clusters (blue for Species A, yellow
    for Species B, green for Species C). Top-right: A second scatter plot titled "Value
    vs Sepal Width - Linked Selection" showing Value (units) on x-axis vs Sepal Width
    (cm) on y-axis with the same color encoding, demonstrating cross-view linking.
    Bottom-left: A histogram titled "Value Distribution - Updates with Selection"
    showing the count distribution across Value (units) in blue bars. Bottom-right:
    A bar chart titled "Category Distribution - Updates with Selection" showing three
    equal-height bars (50 each) for Species A (blue), Species B (yellow), and Species
    C (green). The main title "linked-views-selection · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left corner. All views share consistent color encoding for the three
    species categories.'
