review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-friendly color scheme with blue for increasing and orange-red for decreasing
  - Clean slope chart visualization with clear start/end points
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Good dot and line sizing for visibility
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays all 10 individual products instead of 2 grouped entries (Increasing/Decreasing)
    despite code attempting this
  - Right-side endpoint labels are truncated, showing only Product and value without
    the letter identifier
  - Minor label overlap in crowded middle region (products B, E around 68-72)
