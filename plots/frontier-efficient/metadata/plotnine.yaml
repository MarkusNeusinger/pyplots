review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of efficient frontier concept with proper portfolio optimization
  - Clear visual distinction between the efficient frontier line and random portfolios
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered components
  - Proper annotation of key portfolios (Min Variance and Max Sharpe)
  - Colorblind-friendly color gradient for Sharpe ratio visualization
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Uses helper functions (portfolio_variance, portfolio_return) which slightly deviates
    from pure KISS structure
  - Some empty space in the upper-right portion of the plot could be better utilized
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. It shows approximately 300 scattered portfolio points with colors
    ranging from blue (lower Sharpe ratio ~0.30) to yellow (higher Sharpe ratio ~0.45),
    representing different risk-return combinations. The efficient frontier curve
    is drawn as a prominent blue line that forms the upper boundary of the feasible
    portfolio space, curving from the bottom-left (low risk, low return) to the upper-right
    (high risk, high return). Two key portfolios are marked with yellow square and
    diamond markers: "Min Variance" at approximately (0.16, 0.09) and "Max Sharpe"
    at approximately (0.19, 0.12). The x-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation)" ranging
    from 0.15 to 0.45, and the y-axis shows "Expected Return" ranging from about 0.085
    to 0.175. The title follows the correct format: "frontier-efficient · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai". A color gradient legend for Sharpe Ratio is positioned on the right
    side.'
