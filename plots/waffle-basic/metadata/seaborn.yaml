review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of sns.heatmap with custom colormap to create waffle chart effect
  - Perfect grid structure with clean white separators (linewidths=2)
  - Good color palette starting with Python Blue (#306998)
  - Correct square aspect ratio for waffle charts
  - Legend clearly shows categories with percentages
  - Realistic budget allocation example that demonstrates the chart type well
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the grid (large gap between chart and legend)
  - Grid fills top-to-bottom which is less intuitive than bottom-to-top (like filling
    a glass)
