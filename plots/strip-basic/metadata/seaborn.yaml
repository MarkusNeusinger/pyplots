review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of modern seaborn API with hue parameter to avoid FutureWarning
  - Good implementation of jitter (0.25) matching spec recommendation (0.1-0.3)
  - Thoughtful addition of group mean lines as reference (spec suggestion implemented)
  - Varied distributions across departments demonstrate strip plot utility
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - 'Color palette includes two similar blue shades (Engineering #306998, Sales #4B8BBE)
    which may be hard to distinguish'
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Satisfaction Score (%) or Satisfaction Score (0-100))
  image_description: 'The plot displays a strip plot showing satisfaction scores (y-axis,
    ranging from ~35 to 105) across four departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales,
    HR) on the x-axis. Each department has its own color: Engineering uses blue (#306998),
    Marketing uses yellow (#FFD43B), Sales uses light blue (#4B8BBE), and HR uses
    gray (#646464). Individual data points are shown with jitter applied horizontally
    within each category. Red dashed horizontal lines indicate group means for each
    department. The title "strip-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    A legend in the upper right corner identifies the red dashed line as "Group Mean".
    The y-axis is labeled "Satisfaction Score" and x-axis is labeled "Department".'

        comment: Uses sns.stripplot correctly with proper hue/palette pattern, but
          could showcase more seaborn-specific styling like sns.set_context or sns.despine
  verdict: APPROVED
