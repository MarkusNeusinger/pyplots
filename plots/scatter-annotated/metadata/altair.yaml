  - Clean declarative layer composition using Altair's grammar of graphics
  - Realistic, neutral dataset with recognizable tech companies and accurate financials
  - Smart label positioning with consistent dx/dy offsets to avoid point overlap
  - Proper use of tooltips for interactivity in HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Missing connector lines/arrows from labels to points as mentioned in specification
    notes
  - Could leverage more Altair-specific features like conditional formatting or selections
