review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of rug plot concept with trimodal data showing clustering
    patterns and gaps
  - Clean, minimal design with hidden y-axis appropriate for 1D distribution visualization
  - Helpful annotations explaining each cluster characteristics (density, spread,
    sample size)
  - Good use of alpha transparency for overlapping tick marks
  - Proper font sizing following matplotlib guidelines (24/20/16pt hierarchy)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis label Measurement Value lacks units (e.g., Measurement Value (ms) or similar
    context)
  - Could demonstrate outlier detection capability mentioned in the spec
  - Basic vlines implementation rather than matplotlib more specialized options
