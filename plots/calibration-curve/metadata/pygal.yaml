review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal interactive tooltip system with descriptive labels for
    each data point
  - High-contrast color scheme (dark green, dark red, gray) ensures accessibility
  - Brier scores displayed in legend provide quantitative calibration metrics
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs leverage pygal dual static/interactive capability
  - Clean KISS-style code structure with inline calibration computation
  weaknesses:
  - None significant - previous issues have been addressed
  image_description: 'The plot displays a calibration curve on a white background
    with a 4800×2700 canvas. Three series are shown: (1) a gray dashed diagonal line
    representing "Perfect Calibration" running from (0,0) to (1,1), (2) a dark green
    line with circular markers for "Logistic Regression (Brier: 0.209)" that closely
    tracks the diagonal indicating good calibration, and (3) a dark red line with
    circular markers for "Overconfident Model (Brier: 0.227)" showing the characteristic
    sigmoid pattern where the model is overconfident at both extremes. The x-axis
    is labeled "Mean Predicted Probability" ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, and the y-axis
    is labeled "Fraction of Positives" from 0 to 1. The title follows the correct
    format "calibration-curve · pygal · pyplots.ai". The legend is placed at the bottom
    in a horizontal layout with all three series clearly labeled. Grid lines are subtle
    and non-distracting.'

        comment: Green/red/gray color scheme is high-contrast. Colors are distinguishable
          even for colorblind users due to different hues and saturation levels.

          but takes up considerable space.
