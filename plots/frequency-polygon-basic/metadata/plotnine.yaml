review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_freqpoly for native frequency
    polygon support
  - Realistic psychology research scenario with meaningful response time distributions
  - Clear visual differentiation between three experimental conditions
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are barely visible and could benefit from slightly higher alpha
  - Yellow color for Treatment A could have slightly better contrast against white
    background
  image_description: 'The plot displays a frequency polygon comparing three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) for response time distributions.
    The x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 150 to 700ms,
    and the y-axis shows "Frequency" ranging from 0 to 30. Three distinct colored
    lines represent each condition: blue for Control (centered around 450ms), yellow/gold
    for Treatment A (centered around 380ms, showing fastest responses), and red for
    Treatment B (centered around 420ms with wider spread). The lines connect histogram
    bin midpoints, creating smooth distribution outlines. A legend on the right side
    clearly identifies each condition. The title follows the required format: "frequency-polygon-basic
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The background uses a minimal theme with a subtle grid.
    Lines are thick enough (size=2) to be clearly visible, and the overall layout
    is well-balanced with good use of the canvas space.'
