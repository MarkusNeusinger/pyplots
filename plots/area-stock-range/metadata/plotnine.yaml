review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic stock price patterns (trends, volatility
    clusters, corrections)
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geoms
  - Good text sizing and readability
  - Appropriate semi-transparent fill with solid line overlay
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Missing range selector - The specification explicitly requires an interactive
    range selector with preset ranges and mini chart, but the implementation is just
    a static area chart'
  - Y-axis starts at $0, wasting ~50% of vertical canvas space; stock charts typically
    start near the minimum price value
  - Grid styling is too subtle (alpha 0.3 with light gray makes gridlines barely visible)
  image_description: The plot shows a stock area chart displaying approximately 2
    years of simulated stock price data (Jan 2022 to Jan 2024). The chart features
    a semi-transparent light blue filled area (#306998 with alpha 0.35) beneath a
    solid blue line showing price movements. The y-axis displays "Stock Price (USD)"
    with values formatted as currency ($0 to ~$250), and the x-axis shows "Date" with
    3-month interval labels (e.g., "Jan 2022", "Apr 2022"). The title follows the
    correct format "area-stock-range · plotnine · pyplots.ai". The price starts around
    $150, shows initial volatility with a dip to ~$130, then demonstrates various
    trend phases including a bull run, correction, recovery, and late rally reaching
    a peak around $260 before settling around $230. X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees
    for readability. The background uses a minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.
