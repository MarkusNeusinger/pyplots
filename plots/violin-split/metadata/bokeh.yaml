review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent split violin implementation with halves meeting cleanly at the center
    line
  - White quartile markers (median solid, Q1/Q3 dashed) provide clear statistical
    reference within each violin
  - HoverTool integration provides interactive statistics (median, Q1, Q3, sample
    size) for each violin half
  - Blue/yellow color scheme is visually appealing and highly accessible for colorblind
    users
  - Realistic employee training satisfaction scenario makes the visualization immediately
    understandable
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label text appears slightly smaller relative to x-axis label at display
    resolution
  - Bokeh toolbar icons visible on right edge slightly detract from clean presentation
  - Legend glyph boxes are relatively small compared to the large canvas size
