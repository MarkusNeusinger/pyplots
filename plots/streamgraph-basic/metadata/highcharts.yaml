review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of streamgraph with proper centered baseline and smooth
    flowing curves
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between genres
  - Realistic music streaming scenario with meaningful data trends (growth, decline,
    seasonal)
  - Proper title format and well-structured legend
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific StreamGraphSeries class
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could be tighter - generous margins mean the actual chart area is slightly
    smaller than optimal
  - X-axis lacks a descriptive label (though Month context is clear from labels)
