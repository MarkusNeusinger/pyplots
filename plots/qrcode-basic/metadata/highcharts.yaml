review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts heatmap to render QR code modules
  - Clean, high-contrast black and white color scheme perfect for scanning
  - Proper quiet zone implementation with appropriate margins
  - Title format follows specification exactly
  - HTML export provided for interactive viewing
  - Y-axis flipping handled correctly for proper QR code orientation
  weaknesses:
  - Image height is 3461px instead of expected 3600px (minor rendering variance from
    Selenium screenshot)
  - Code structure is necessarily complex due to Selenium-based PNG export
  image_description: 'The plot displays a valid QR code rendered as a heatmap visualization
    using Highcharts. The QR code is centered on a white background with a 3600x3600
    square canvas. The title "qrcode-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold black text (48px), with a subtitle "Encoded: https://pyplots.ai" in
    smaller gray text below it. The QR code itself shows the characteristic three
    finder patterns (large squares) in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left corners.
    The code uses pure black (#000000) modules on white (#ffffff) background with
    high contrast. The quiet zone (white border) is visible around the QR code. The
    QR code pattern is properly oriented and appears scannable.'
