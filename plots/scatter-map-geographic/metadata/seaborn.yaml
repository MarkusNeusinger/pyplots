review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic context with simplified coastlines providing clear continental
    boundaries
  - Clean dual-legend system separating categorical (region) and continuous (population)
    encodings
  - Good use of seaborn hue and size parameters for multi-dimensional encoding
  - Realistic city data with accurate coordinates and population values
  - Professional color palette with good contrast against the ocean/land background
  - Proper font scaling for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Region legend shows redundant region label beneath Region title (seaborn auto-generates
    column name)
  - The marker_size column is calculated but never used - sizes parameter handles
    it internally
  - Blue and teal colors for Asia and Oceania could be slightly more differentiated
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a geographic scatter map showing 25 major world cities positioned by their latitude/longitude coordinates on a world map. The background uses a light blue color (#d4e8f7) to represent oceans, with simplified continent outlines rendered as gray filled polygons (#e8e8e8 fill, #b0b0b0 border). Cities are represented as circular markers with:
    - Color encoding region: Asia (blue #306998), North America (orange #E07B53), Europe (yellow #FFD43B), Oceania (teal #2DB5AE), Africa (purple #9D6AB8), South America (green #5AAE61)
    - Size encoding population: Ranges from ~150 (small cities ~3M) to ~800 (Tokyo ~37M)
    - White edge highlighting on all markers with alpha=0.8

    Two legends are positioned in the lower corners: Region legend (lower-left) and Population size legend (lower-right). The title "scatter-map-geographic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in bold. Axes show Longitude (°) and Latitude (°) with subtle dashed grid lines.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with hue/size encoding and sns.set_theme for
          styling. Good seaborn usage but basemap is pure matplotlib
