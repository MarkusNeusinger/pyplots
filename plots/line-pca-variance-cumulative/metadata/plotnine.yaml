review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layered composition (7
    geom/annotate layers)
  - Real Wine dataset provides authentic PCA results rather than synthetic data
  - Elbow point detection and annotation with drop-line creates a clear visual narrative
  - Shaded threshold regions (90-95% and 95%+) add visual sophistication beyond simple
    dashed lines
  - All font sizes explicitly set following library rules for 4800x2700 output
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct amber/green threshold colors
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis starts at 28% leaving dead space below the first data point at ~36%; consider
    starting at 0% or closer to the first data point
  - Elbow annotation slightly crowds the component 2-3 area; positioning could be
    improved
  - Threshold labels (90%, 95%) are pushed to the far right edge and appear cramped
  - Missing the optional 99% threshold line mentioned in the spec
  - Could benefit from a subtle individual variance bar overlay (spec mentions as
    optional enhancement) to add more data density
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative explained variance line chart
    for PCA component selection using the Wine dataset (13 components). A solid blue
    line (#306998) with white-filled circular markers traces the cumulative variance
    from ~36% at component 1 to ~100% at component 13. An orange/red highlighted larger
    marker at component 2 (~55.4%) marks the detected elbow point, with a bold red
    annotation label "Elbow at 2 components (55.4%)" and a dotted vertical drop-line
    to the x-axis. Two dashed horizontal threshold lines appear at 90% (amber/orange)
    and 95% (green), with corresponding "90%" and "95%" text labels on the right edge.
    Shaded green regions fill the area between 90-95% and above 95%. The background
    is a light gray panel (#FAFAFA) with subtle horizontal grid lines. The title reads
    "line-pca-variance-cumulative · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold. Axis labels are
    "Number of Principal Components" (x) and "Cumulative Explained Variance (%)" (y).
    Y-axis ranges from 30% to 100%.
