review:
  strengths:
  - Correct EAN-13 encoding implementation with proper L/G/R code patterns
  - Guard bars (start, center, end) properly extend below regular bars
  - Human-readable digits correctly positioned with first digit outside left guard
  - Clean white background with proper quiet zones
  - Uses realistic German product code
  - Proper use of lets-plot geom_rect for bar rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Helper functions deviate from pure KISS structure (though necessary for encoding
    complexity)
  - Could leverage more lets-plot interactive features
  image_description: 'The plot displays a properly rendered EAN-13 barcode for the
    German product code "4006381333931". The barcode consists of black vertical bars
    of varying widths on a white background, following the standard EAN-13 encoding
    pattern. The title "barcode-ean13 · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in black text. Below the barcode, the 13 human-readable digits are displayed:
    the first digit "4" is positioned outside the left guard pattern, followed by
    "006381" under the left half, and "333931" under the right half of the barcode.
    The guard patterns (start, center, and end) extend slightly lower than the main
    bars, as required by the EAN-13 standard. The barcode is well-centered with adequate
    quiet zones on both sides.'
