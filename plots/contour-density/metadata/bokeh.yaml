review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent contour visualization with 8 clearly visible density levels
  - Smart approach using matplotlib for KDE contour extraction then rendering in Bokeh
  - Good color gradient from light blue (low density) to dark blue (high density)
  - Scatter point overlay provides valuable context for the underlying data
  - Proper font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Two-cluster data effectively demonstrates density variation
  weaknesses:
  - The legend text "Data points" is minimal and could be more descriptive
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib for contour extraction rather than using a more Bokeh-native
    solution
