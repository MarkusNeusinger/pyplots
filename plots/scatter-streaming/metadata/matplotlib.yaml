review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of streaming data concept with clear temporal
    encoding
  - Well-implemented colorbar showing time progression with inverted axis (0=newest
    at top)
  - Yellow highlight for latest reading provides immediate visual identification
  - Arrow annotation cleverly shows data flow direction
  - Buffer info annotation adds context about streaming parameters
  - Good use of the Blues colormap for colorblind accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend in lower right may overlap with data points in certain data distributions
  - Iterating over each point individually for scatter is less efficient than using
    array-based alpha (though visually identical)
  - Pandas imported only for date_range - could simplify to numpy only since timestamps
    are not displayed
  image_description: 'The plot displays a streaming scatter plot showing temperature
    (°C) on the x-axis versus humidity (%) on the y-axis. There are 200 data points
    visible, representing simulated sensor readings. The visualization uses a blue
    color gradient from the Blues colormap - older points appear lighter/more transparent
    (indicating ~60 seconds ago) while newer points appear darker and more opaque.
    A vertical colorbar on the right shows "Time (seconds ago)" with values from 0
    (newest, light blue at top) to 60 (oldest, dark blue at bottom). The most recent
    data point is highlighted with a bright yellow marker with a blue border, accompanied
    by an arrow pointing to it from a previous position to indicate data flow direction.
    The legend in the lower right labels this as "Latest reading". Italicized annotation
    text in the upper left shows "Buffer: 200 points | Stream rate: ~3 pts/sec". The
    title follows the correct format: "scatter-streaming · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    Grid lines are visible with subtle alpha. Overall layout is well-balanced with
    the plot occupying good canvas space.'
