review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution for a plot type Altair does not natively support
  - Custom marching squares algorithm implementation for generating contour line segments
  - Effective use of layered marks (rect for filled background + rule for contour
    lines)
  - Viridis colormap with white contour lines creates beautiful contrast
  - Well-configured legend with appropriate sizing
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units or more context
