review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of range selector with all required preset buttons (1M,
    3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All)
  - Proper use of rangeslider mini chart for custom date selection
  - Clean semi-transparent fill with solid line on top matching spec requirements
  - Good realistic stock data with trend, volatility, and dip/recovery pattern
  - Well-formatted hover tooltips with date and price
  - Proper title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle
  - Range selector button text appears slightly small compared to other elements
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a stock price area chart spanning from January 2023 to December 2025 (approximately 3 years of data). The main chart shows price values on the y-axis ranging from $0 to $200, with the actual price data oscillating between roughly $125 and $195. The area beneath the price line is filled with a semi-transparent blue color (rgba with ~35% opacity), and a solid blue line traces the price at the top edge. A noticeable dip and recovery pattern is visible around mid-2024, where prices dropped to approximately $130 before recovering to peak around $195.

    At the top-left of the chart, there are six range selector buttons: 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, and All, styled with a light blue background and blue borders. The "All" button appears to be the active/selected state. Below the main chart, there is a rangeslider (mini chart) showing the full data range with the same filled area pattern, allowing users to select custom date ranges.

    The title "area-stock-range · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark gray text. The y-axis is labeled "Price (USD)" with dollar sign prefixes on tick values. The x-axis is labeled "Date" with tick marks showing month and year (e.g., "Jul 2023", "Jan 2024"). Grid lines are subtle with low opacity. The overall color scheme uses a blue (#306998) for the main data visualization against a white background.
