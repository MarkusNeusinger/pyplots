review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements the L-shaped finder pattern (solid black on left and bottom
    edges)
  - Proper alternating timing pattern on top and right edges
  - Clean high-contrast black/white visualization ideal for barcode scanning
  - Appropriate quiet zone (white border) around the barcode
  - Good use of sns.heatmap with custom binary colormap
  - Square aspect ratio is appropriate for Data Matrix codes
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - The data pattern is manually hardcoded rather than using an actual Data Matrix
    encoding library (spec suggests pylibdmtx, treepoem, or segno)
  - Does not use any distinctive seaborn features beyond basic heatmap functionality
  image_description: The plot displays a 10x10 Data Matrix 2D barcode rendered as
    a heatmap with high-contrast black and white cells. The barcode correctly shows
    the L-shaped finder pattern with a solid black left column and solid black bottom
    row. The top row and right column display the alternating (clock) timing pattern
    as required by the spec. The interior 8x8 region contains a simulated data pattern
    representing encoded information. A white quiet zone surrounds the barcode on
    all sides. The title "datamatrix-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in black text. The overall layout uses a square format which is appropriate
    for this barcode type.

        comment: sns.heatmap is used appropriately but this is basic usage; seaborn
          does not have specialized barcode features
