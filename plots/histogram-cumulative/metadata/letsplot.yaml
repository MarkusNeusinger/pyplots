review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual quality with proper text sizing and canvas utilization
  - Correct implementation of cumulative histogram using geom_rect for precise bin
    control
  - Realistic API response time scenario with appropriate data distribution
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility seed
  - Proper title format following spec guidelines
  weaknesses:
  - Could use geom_histogram with cumulative parameter if available, though geom_rect
    approach is valid
  image_description: The plot displays a cumulative histogram of API response times
    in milliseconds using a blue color (#306998) with darker borders (#1e4a6e). The
    x-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from 0 to ~750ms, and the y-axis shows
    "Cumulative Count" from 0 to 500. The histogram exhibits a characteristic cumulative
    distribution shape - steep initial rise (many fast responses) then gradually flattening
    (fewer slow responses). The title "histogram-cumulative · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is prominently displayed at the top. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle
    gray gridlines and good use of canvas space.
  verdict: APPROVED
