review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of mark_arc with theta/radius encoding to create proper rose chart
    (radius proportional to value, not angle)
  - Clean data setup with month ordering preserved via explicit order column
  - Good colorblind-friendly palette with distinct colors per month
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output leveraging Altair interactive capabilities
  - Value labels positioned nicely on each segment with radiusOffset
  - Tooltips provide additional interactivity in HTML version
  weaknesses:
  - Missing radial gridlines mentioned in the specification as an aid for value estimation
  - Chart does not start at 12 o'clock (top) for time data as recommended in spec
    notes
  - Canvas utilization could be improved - chart is somewhat left-heavy with unused
    space
  - Title includes Monthly Rainfall prefix instead of pure {spec-id} · {library} ·
