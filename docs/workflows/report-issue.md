# Report Issues

Report issues with existing plot specifications or implementations.

## Overview

Found a problem with an existing plot? The report system helps you:
1. Submit structured issue reports
2. Get AI-powered analysis and validation
3. Queue issues for maintainer review and fix

Reports are validated by AI and structured for efficient review.

## How to Report

### From pyplots.ai (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the plot page (e.g., `pyplots.ai/scatter-basic`)
2. Click **"report issue"** in the breadcrumb bar (top right)
3. Complete the form on GitHub
4. Wait for AI validation

**Spec issues:** Report from the overview page (e.g., `/scatter-basic`) → opens spec issue template
**Impl issues:** Report from the library page (e.g., `/scatter-basic/matplotlib`) → opens impl issue template with library pre-filled

### From GitHub

1. Go to [New Issue](https://github.com/MarkusNeusinger/pyplots/issues/new/choose)
2. Select the appropriate template:
   - **"Report Spec Issue"** - for specification problems (affects all libraries)
   - **"Report Implementation Issue"** - for implementation problems (specific library)
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Submit

## Workflow

```
User submits report (spec or impl template)
        │
        ▼ (report-pending label auto-added)
        │
report-validate.yml runs:
  ├── Validates spec/impl exists
  ├── Reads specification and metadata
  ├── AI analyzes the issue
  ├── Posts structured analysis comment
  └── Updates labels (report-validated + category + target)
        │
        ▼
Issue ready for maintainer review
        │
        ▼
Maintainer fixes manually:
  ├── Spec issues: Edit specification directly
  └── Impl issues: Trigger impl-generate.yml to regenerate
```

## Tips for Good Reports

1. **Be specific:** Describe exactly what's wrong
2. **Include context:** What did you expect vs. what happened?
3. **Use screenshots:** Especially for visual issues
4. **Check the spec:** Make sure the spec ID is correct
5. **One issue per report:** Don't combine multiple issues
