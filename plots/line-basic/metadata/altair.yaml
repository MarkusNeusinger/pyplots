review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and line/point visibility
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format and all required features
  - Realistic, comprehensible data scenario (monthly temperature with seasonal pattern)
  - Clean KISS code structure following project guidelines
  - Good use of layered chart (line + points) for enhanced visibility
  - Proper temporal encoding (:T) for datetime data
  weaknesses:
  - Missing Altair distinctive interactive features (tooltips, .interactive() for
    zoom/pan) that showcase the library strengths
  - Grid lines are too subtle (gridOpacity=0.3) making them barely visible
