review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of radar chart using plotnine grammar of graphics by
    converting polar to Cartesian coordinates
  - Clean polygon layering with appropriate transparency (alpha=0.2) allowing overlap
    visibility
  - Well-structured gridlines (dashed circles) and spokes for reference
  - Good color choices with Python Blue and Yellow plus complementary colors
  - Realistic product comparison scenario with 6 meaningful attributes
  - Proper polygon closure by repeating first point
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed set - though data is deterministic, best practice is to include
    np.random.seed(42)
  - Color palette includes red and green which can be problematic for red-green colorblind
