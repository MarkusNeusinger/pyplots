review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: sorted bars, color gradient,
    error bars, and value annotations'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper grammar of graphics
    structure
  - Well-chosen loan default prediction scenario with realistic feature names and
    importance values
  - Good use of coord_flip() for horizontal bars with readable feature names
  - Proper text sizing for high-resolution output (4800x2700 px)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned far from the main plot area, creating visual disconnect
  - Missing random seed even though data is deterministic (minor but good practice)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing feature importance
    scores for a loan default prediction model. There are 15 features shown, sorted
    from highest importance (income at 0.182) to lowest (region at 0.003). The bars
    use a sequential color gradient from light blue (#A8D5E5) for low importance to
    dark blue (#306998) for high importance. Each bar has error bars (standard deviation)
    shown in dark gray, and importance values are annotated at the end of each bar.
    The title "bar-feature-importance · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is at the top, the
    y-axis is labeled "Feature", and the x-axis is labeled "Importance Score". A color
    legend for the gradient is positioned on the right side. The layout is clean with
    subtle grid lines on the x-axis only.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar, coord_flip, scale_fill_gradient, and theme customization;
          HTML export for interactivity. Could use more advanced lets-plot specific
          features
  verdict: APPROVED
