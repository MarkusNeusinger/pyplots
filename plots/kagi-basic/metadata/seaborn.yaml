review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements Kagi chart algorithm with proper reversal logic
  - Clear visual distinction between yang (thick green) and yin (thin red) segments
  - Proper horizontal connectors (shoulders/waists) at transition points
  - Good use of seaborn theming for professional appearance
  - Realistic stock price data generation with appropriate reversal threshold
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Red-green color combination is not colorblind-safe (spec requires these colors,
    but implementation could note accessibility concern)
  - Grid uses dashed lines which can be slightly distracting
  - Does not use seaborn plotting functions - only uses seaborn for styling/theming
  - The yang determination logic in the reversal-down case checks price > last_low
    which may not accurately reflect the intended yang/yin transition logic
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Kagi chart showing price movements over
    approximately 21 line segments. The chart uses thick green lines (sea green, #2E8B57)
    for yang/bullish segments and thin red/crimson lines (#DC143C) for yin/bearish
    segments. Vertical lines represent price movements with horizontal connectors
    (shoulders/waists) at transition points. The Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging
    from approximately $77 to $115, and the X-axis shows "Kagi Line Index" from 0
    to 20. A legend in the upper left identifies "Yang (Bullish)" with a thick green
    line and "Yin (Bearish)" with a thin red line. The title follows the required
    format "kagi-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". The chart demonstrates multiple trend
    reversals with clear thick-to-thin line transitions. A subtle dashed grid is visible
    in the background. The whitegrid seaborn theme provides a clean aesthetic.'
