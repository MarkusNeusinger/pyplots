review:
  strengths:
  - Creative solution extending pygal Graph class to implement geographic heatmap
    that pygal does not natively support
  - Excellent geographic context with California coastline boundaries
  - Beautiful smooth density gradient using Gaussian kernel smoothing
  - Good choice of YlOrRd colormap for density visualization
  - Proper colorbar with density scale
  weaknesses:
  - Violates KISS principle by using a custom class instead of simple linear code
    flow
  - Scatter point overlay is too faint and small (alpha=0.3, r=4) to be clearly visible
  - No grid lines to help read coordinate values
  - Colorbar has only 3 tick values which limits precision of reading density values
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic heatmap of California showing
    spatial density of environmental monitoring data. The visualization uses a YlOrRd
    (yellow-orange-red) colormap to represent density values ranging from 0.0 to 105.5.
    Three distinct density hotspots are visible: one in Northern California (around
    lat 38.5°, lon -122.5°), one on the Central California coast (around lat 36.5°,
    lon -121.5°), and one in Southern California (around lat 34°, lon -118°). The
    California coastline is drawn as a dark gray outline, providing geographic context.
    Small blue scatter points overlay the heatmap showing the original data point
    locations. The plot has a light blue background with axis labels showing ''Latitude
    (°)'' and ''Longitude (°)''. A colorbar on the right shows the ''Density'' scale
    with values at 0.0, 52.7, and 105.5. The title correctly reads ''heatmap-geographic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai''.'
