review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the navigator feature with draggable selection window
    and resize handles
  - 'Good use of Highcharts Stock-specific features: range selector buttons (1M, 3M,
    6M, 1Y, YTD, All), date input fields, scrollbar'
  - Clean data generation with realistic sensor reading pattern (trend + seasonality
    + noise)
  - Proper colorblind-safe color choice (#306998)
  - Subtitle provides helpful context about the data
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs are generated
  weaknesses:
  - Uses manual JSON chart options instead of the highcharts_core Python library classes;
    this works but bypasses the library object-oriented API
  - X-axis labels show Jan 2025 repeating multiple times in the visible range which
    looks odd (could benefit from smarter date formatting)
  image_description: The plot displays a Highcharts Stock line chart with a mini navigator
    at the bottom. The main chart shows "Sensor Reading" data over time (approximately
    one year visible, Dec 2024 - Jan 2025), with values ranging from ~68 to 85 on
    the Y-axis labeled "Sensor Value (units)". The line is rendered in a blue color
    (#306998). The title "line-navigator · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold, with a subtitle "Daily Sensor Readings with Interactive Navigator
    (2022-2025)". Range selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All) and date input
    fields are visible at the top left. The bottom navigator pane shows the full 3-year
    dataset extent (Jan 2022 - Jan 2025) with a selection window highlighted. A scrollbar
    is present below the navigator. The legend shows "Sensor Reading" at the top.
    Grid lines are subtle. The X-axis shows dates in "Mon Year" format with some repetition
    of "Jan 2025" labels. Overall layout is clean with good use of canvas space.
