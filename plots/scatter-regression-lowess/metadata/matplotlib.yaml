review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of LOWESS smoothing on complex non-linear data (sine +
    quadratic + noise)
  - LOWESS curve is visually distinct with contrasting yellow color and thick line
    (linewidth=4)
  - Appropriate smoothing bandwidth (frac=0.3) as recommended in spec
  - Marker transparency (alpha=0.6) shows data density while keeping LOWESS curve
    visible
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - All text elements properly sized for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could be "Measurement Index (samples)" or similar)
  - Data context is generic "Measurement Index" / "Response Value" - could be more
    domain-specific
