review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Realistic business scenario with employee performance data
  - Proper grouped box plot implementation with clear visual distinction between subcategories
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like BoxPlotSeries and proper chart configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function calc_boxplot_stats() which violates the KISS principle
    (no functions/classes rule)
  - Outliers are not displayed as separate points (spec requests outliers to be shown)
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the chart area
