review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of realistic European GDP data with proper ISO-3 country codes
  - Clean Viridis colorblind-safe color palette with appropriate value range
  - Well-formatted title following the required naming convention
  - Good use of Plotly geographic features (scope, projection, coastlines, ocean coloring)
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Missing data countries shown gracefully in gray
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra prefix before the spec-id pattern
  - Country border lines could be slightly thicker for better boundary visibility
  - Could add hover templates to enhance interactive HTML with formatted GDP values
