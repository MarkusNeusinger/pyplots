review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts Maps library with proper drilldown functionality and
    breadcrumb navigation
  - Well-designed color scale using blue sequential palette that is colorblind-safe
  - Comprehensive data with 50 states and city-level detail for 16 major states
  - Clean visual presentation with state labels filtered by value to prevent clutter
  - Proper HTML export with CDN links for interactive standalone version
  weaknesses:
  - The spec requests 3-level hierarchy (country→state→city) but implementation shows
    state-level as the initial view, missing the top region level aggregation in the
    static image
  - Alaska appears semi-transparent in the static PNG which is slightly distracting
  image_description: The plot displays a choropleth map of the United States showing
    regional sales performance data. States are colored using a blue sequential color
    scale ranging from light blue (low values, ~$0M) to dark navy blue (high values,
    up to ~$250M). California, New York, Texas, and Florida stand out as the darkest
    states indicating highest sales. The title "map-drilldown-geographic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text, with a subtitle "Regional
    Sales Performance ($M) — Click a state to drill down to cities" below it. State
    names are labeled directly on the map with white text outlines for readability.
    A vertical color legend on the right shows "Sales ($M)" with value labels from
    $0M to $250M. Alaska and Hawaii are shown below the continental US. The map uses
    white borders between states.
