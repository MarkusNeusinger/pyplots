review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent step chart implementation with correct left step style creating proper
    staircase pattern
  - Clear readable text at all sizes (title 72px, axis labels 48px, tick labels 36px)
  - Realistic cumulative sales scenario with appropriate data values
  - Clean KISS code structure following library guidelines exactly
  - Proper PNG export using Selenium with inline Highcharts JS
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears enabled but not visible in rendered image - may need positioning
    adjustment
  - Only demonstrates one step style (left) when spec mentions pre/post/mid options
  - Layout has slightly unbalanced margins
  image_description: The plot displays a step chart showing cumulative sales data
    over 12 months (January through December). The chart uses a deep blue color (#306998)
    for the step line with circular markers at each data point. The title "step-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. The Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative
    Sales ($K)" ranging from 0 to 825, and the X-axis is labeled "Month" with all
    12 month abbreviations displayed. The step pattern shows values remaining constant
    (horizontal lines) until the next month, then jumping vertically to the new value
    - creating the characteristic staircase appearance. Grid lines are visible on
    the Y-axis. The data shows a steady upward trend from $45K in January to $780K
    in December.
