review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with the Viridis colormap showing the chirp signal frequency
    sweep distinctly
  - Proper use of dB scale for power representation as recommended in spec
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Interactive hovertemplate provides detailed time/frequency/power information on
    mouseover
  - Correct title format and axis labeling with appropriate units
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines (though acceptable for heatmap, subtle grid could help with
    time/frequency reading)
  - Could utilize more Plotly-specific interactive features like range sliders or
    animation controls
  image_description: The plot displays a spectrogram heatmap showing a chirp signal
    with frequency increasing linearly from approximately 100 Hz at time 0 to 800
    Hz at time 2 seconds. The main signal trace appears as a bright yellow diagonal
    line sweeping from bottom-left to top-right against a teal/green background. The
    colorscale uses Viridis (yellow=high power, teal=medium, purple=low). The x-axis
    shows "Time (seconds)" ranging from 0 to ~1.9, y-axis shows "Frequency (Hz)" ranging
    from 0 to 2000. A colorbar on the right indicates "Power (dB)" ranging from approximately
    -90 to -20 dB. The title correctly reads "spectrogram-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai".
    Background noise is visible as random speckles across the frequency range.
