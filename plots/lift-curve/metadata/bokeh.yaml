review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with 42pt title, 32pt axis labels, 24pt tick labels - perfectly
    readable at 4800x2700
  - Clean implementation of lift curve with proper baseline reference line at y=1
  - Decile markers with contrasting yellow fill and blue outline provide clear data
    point emphasis
  - Realistic marketing campaign scenario with 15% baseline response rate
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity - would allow users to see exact lift values
    at each percentage
  - Y-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., Cumulative Lift Model/Random)
  - Legend text slightly small relative to other text elements on the large canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve visualization on a light gray
    background (#fafafa). A blue line (#306998) represents the model lift, starting
    at approximately 5.2 at 1% population, peaking around 5.7 at 3-5%, then smoothly
    declining toward 1.0 as population approaches 100%. A horizontal dashed gray line
    at y=1 represents the random selection baseline. Yellow circular markers with
    blue outlines are placed at each decile (10%, 20%, ..., 100%) along the curve.
    The title "lift-curve · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in bold at the top-left. The
    x-axis is labeled "Population Targeted (%)" ranging from 0-105, and the y-axis
    shows "Cumulative Lift Ratio" from 0 to ~6.5. A legend in the top-right corner
    identifies "Model Lift" (line) and "Decile Markers" (circles). Grid lines are
    subtle with dashed styling and low alpha.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource and Span which are Bokeh features, but doesn't
          leverage interactive capabilities like HoverTool which would be valuable
          for showing exact lift values at each point
  verdict: APPROVED
