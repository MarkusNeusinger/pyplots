review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of export menu functionality via embedded JavaScript
    in HTML output
  - Three distinct export formats (PNG, SVG, CSV) as specified with working download
    functionality
  - Clean, well-styled chart with appropriate colors from pyplots color scheme
  - Good use of pygal native SVG capabilities for high-resolution output
  - Deterministic data with realistic seasonal sales pattern
  weaknesses:
  - The PNG static output does not show the export menu button (menu only visible
    in HTML)
  - Legend placement at bottom creates excessive gap between chart and legend
  image_description: The plot displays a multi-line chart showing monthly sales data
    for three products (Product A, B, C) over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The chart uses
    a white background with subtle gray grid lines. Product A is rendered in a dark
    blue (#306998) line with circular dot markers, Product B in golden yellow (#FFD43B),
    and Product C in a light blue (#4B8BBE). The title "chart-export-menu · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. The Y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands)"
    and the X-axis is labeled "Month". The legend appears at the bottom with three
    colored squares identifying each product line. All three lines show a seasonal
    pattern peaking around July-August. Lines are clearly distinguishable with good
    spacing and data points marked with visible dots.
