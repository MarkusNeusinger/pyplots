review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of housing price prediction as a realistic regression context that
    makes the residual analysis meaningful
  - Clear U-shaped trend in residuals demonstrates non-linearity detection, which
    is the primary purpose of residual plots
  - Good implementation of outlier highlighting with color differentiation (blue/yellow)
    using hue parameter
  - Reference line at y=0 and ±2 SD bands provide clear visual guides for interpretation
  - Proper use of seaborn regplot for polynomial trend line with confidence interval
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use seaborn built-in residplot function which is specifically designed
    for this plot type
  - The Trend label in regplot line_kws does not appear in the legend (seaborn regplot
    does not add to legend automatically)
