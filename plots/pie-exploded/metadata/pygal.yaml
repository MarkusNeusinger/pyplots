review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal XML filter mechanism to implement custom explosion effect
  - Well-designed custom style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean color palette with good accessibility
  - Creative approach to exploded pie since pygal lacks native explosion support
  - Both PNG and HTML output provided
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a function definition (explode_slices) which deviates from KISS structure,
    though justified by pygal API design requiring a callable for add_xml_filter
