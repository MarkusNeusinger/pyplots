review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves algorithm using Fourier basis functions
  - Clean visualization that clearly shows Setosa species separation from Versicolor/Virginica
  - Proper normalization with StandardScaler prevents dominant variables
  - Appropriate transparency (alpha=0.4) for 150 overlapping curves reveals density
    patterns
  - X-axis uses mathematically meaningful tick labels (-π, -π/2, 0, π/2, π)
  weaknesses:
  - Missing np.random.seed(42) in code (though Iris dataset is deterministic, best
    practice is to include it)
  - Linewidth=1.5 is slightly below recommended 2-4 for high-resolution plots per
    library guidelines
  - Legend sample lines use alpha=0.8 while actual curves use alpha=0.4, creating
    visual inconsistency
