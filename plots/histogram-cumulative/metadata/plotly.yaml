review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear step function representation of cumulative
    distribution
  - Thoughtful addition of percentile reference lines (25th, 50th, 75th) with dashed
    yellow styling that enhances understanding
  - Custom hover templates provide informative tooltips showing exact proportions
  - Proper use of shape=hv for authentic step function appearance
  - Good color scheme using Python Blue and Yellow with appropriate contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Uses manual histogram calculation with np.histogram instead of Plotly native go.Histogram
    with cumulative_enabled=True
  - Legend position in upper-left could be moved to avoid potential visual overlap
