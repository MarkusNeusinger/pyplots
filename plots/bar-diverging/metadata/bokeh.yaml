review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of diverging bar chart with clear visual distinction
    between positive/negative values
  - Proper use of horizontal orientation for long category labels as recommended in
    spec
  - Good sorting by value for pattern recognition
  - Clean zero baseline using Bokeh Span annotation
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic NPS-style customer satisfaction data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain blue=positive, yellow=negative color encoding
  - No random seed set (though data is deterministic, adding np.random.seed(42) would
    be consistent with style guide)
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features like HoverTool to show exact values
    on hover
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal diverging bar chart showing customer
    satisfaction survey results (Net Promoter Score style) across 10 categories. Blue
    bars (#306998) extend rightward from zero for positive values, while yellow/gold
    bars (#FFD43B) extend leftward for negative values. Categories are sorted by value
    from lowest (Tech Support at -35) to highest (Return Policy at +52). The title
    "bar-diverging · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left. X-axis shows "Net
    Satisfaction Score" ranging from -60 to 60+, Y-axis shows "Category" with all
    10 category labels clearly visible. A subtle vertical baseline at zero separates
    positive from negative values. The plot uses the full canvas width effectively
    with good proportions.
