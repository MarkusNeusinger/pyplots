review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario with plant growth across soil types - realistic and scientifically
    relevant
  - Good use of colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue/Yellow
  - Clean implementation of jitter using numpy random uniform
  - Custom hover templates enhance interactivity
  - Proper output in both PNG and HTML formats
  - Different distributions per category (varying means and standard deviations) plus
    explicit outliers demonstrate strip plot capabilities well
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is redundant with x-axis labels (both show Clay, Sandy, Loam, Peat, Chalk)
    - consider removing legend or using it for a different variable
  - Grid alpha at 0.1 is perhaps too subtle - 0.2-0.3 would be more visible while
    still unobtrusive
