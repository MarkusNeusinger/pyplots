review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 resolution (72px title,
    48px axis titles, 36px labels)
  - Clean implementation following library rules with inline Highcharts JS for headless
    Chrome compatibility
  - Proper use of Python Blue color with transparency (rgba 0.7) for overlapping point
    visibility
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Subtle dashed grid lines enhance readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than contextual with units
  - Marker radius (18) could be slightly smaller for better distinction between nearby
    points
  - Does not leverage Highcharts tooltip/hover interactivity features visible in the
    static image
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot on a white background with approximately
    100 data points. The points are rendered as filled circles in a muted blue color
    (Python Blue) with transparency (alpha ~0.7). The title "scatter-basic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. The X-axis is labeled "X
    Value" (ranging from ~4.8 to ~13.6) and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" (ranging
    from ~2 to ~15). Both axes have subtle gray dashed grid lines. The data shows
    a clear positive correlation pattern with some scatter/noise. The overall layout
    is clean and professional with good proportions.

          the static output
  verdict: APPROVED
