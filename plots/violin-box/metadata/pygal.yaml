review:
  strengths:
  - Creative implementation using XY chart to construct violin shapes manually with
    KDE calculation
  - Proper KDE computation using Silverman's rule for bandwidth selection
  - Box plot statistics correctly calculated (median, Q1, Q3, whiskers, outliers)
  - Good color palette with distinct, colorblind-safe colors
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful variation between groups
  weaknesses:
  - Legend at bottom is redundant since x-axis already shows department names
  - Box plot elements (whiskers, median lines) could have stronger contrast against
    the violin fill
  - The complexity of manually building violin shapes leads to many unnamed series
    (None) in the chart
