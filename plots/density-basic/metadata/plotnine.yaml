review:
  strengths:
  - Clean plotnine grammar of graphics implementation using geom_density with appropriate
    bandwidth
  - Includes rug plot showing individual observations as specified in notes
  - Bimodal distribution demonstrates distribution characteristics well (skewness,
    modality)
  - Proper title format with spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
  - Good use of theme_minimal with appropriately sized text elements for 4800x2700
    output
  - Realistic test scores scenario with sensible value range (0-100)
  weaknesses:
  - Rug plot color (yellow) could have better contrast against the white background
    for accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a smooth density curve representing the distribution
    of test scores. The main density area is filled with a semi-transparent blue color
    (#306998) with a matching blue outline. The distribution shows clear bimodality:
    a primary peak around 72 points and a secondary bump around 88 points, representing
    the "high achievers" group. A yellow/gold rug plot along the x-axis shows individual
    observations as small vertical lines. The x-axis is labeled "Test Score (points)"
    ranging from 30 to 100, and the y-axis shows "Probability Density" ranging from
    0.00 to 0.03. The title "density-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is prominently
    displayed at the top. The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle gray grid
    lines.'

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_density + geom_rug
          layering, theme_minimal, and element_text sizing. Could leverage additional
          plotnine features like annotate or faceting for bonus.
  verdict: APPROVED
