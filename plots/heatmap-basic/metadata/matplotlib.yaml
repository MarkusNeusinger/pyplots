review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of adaptive text colors (white on dark, black on light) for cell
    annotations ensuring readability
  - 'Perfect implementation of spec requirements: diverging colormap (RdBu_r), cell
    annotations, and colorbar'
  - Clean, symmetric correlation matrix with realistic department names providing
    meaningful context
  - Square aspect ratio (12×12) ideal for matrix visualization
  - Well-sized fonts throughout (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks, 14pt annotations)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like ax.matshow() instead of ax.imshow()
    for more idiomatic matrix display
  - Department axis labels could include additional context (e.g., "Department" →
    "Department Correlation")
  image_description: The plot displays an 8×8 correlation matrix heatmap showing relationships
    between 8 company departments (Sales, Marketing, Support, Dev, HR, Finance, Ops,
    Legal). The heatmap uses the RdBu_r diverging colormap with dark red representing
    strong positive correlations (+1.0), dark blue representing strong negative correlations
    (-1.0), and white/light colors representing near-zero correlations. The diagonal
    shows perfect self-correlation (1.00) in dark red. Each cell contains its correlation
    coefficient value (e.g., -0.30, 0.49, -1.00) with white text on dark backgrounds
    and black text on light backgrounds for optimal readability. A vertical colorbar
    on the right shows the scale from -1.0 to +1.0 labeled "Correlation Coefficient".
    The title "heatmap-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis
    labels are rotated 45° for readability.
