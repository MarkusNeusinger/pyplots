review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with smooth color transitions from 80x80 grid resolution
  - Viridis colormap is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  - Subtle white contour line overlay at 0.4 alpha helps with precise level identification
    without being distracting
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seaborn styling setup
  - Multi-peak surface with saddle region demonstrates varied contour features
  - Correct title format and well-sized text elements
  - Equal aspect ratio ensures geometric accuracy of contours
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) rather than having units
    or representing a specific real-world context
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features since seaborn lacks native contour functions
    - relies primarily on matplotlib for the actual contour plotting
  - Could benefit from a more application-specific scenario (e.g., topographic elevation,
    temperature field) rather than abstract mathematical function
