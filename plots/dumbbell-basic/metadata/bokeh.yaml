quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal orientation with categories on y-axis as recommended in spec
  - Data sorted by difference reveals patterns effectively (smallest to largest improvement)
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme with good contrast (blue/yellow instead of red/green)
  - Clean, subtle connecting lines that do not overpower the dots
  - Appropriate dot sizing for the data density
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario with plausible score values
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears partially cut off at the bottom right corner of the plot
  - Could leverage Bokeh interactive features (hover tooltips) in the HTML output
  - All improvements are positive; including one negative change would demonstrate
    the plot type full capability
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal dumbbell chart comparing employee
    satisfaction scores before and after policy changes across 8 departments. Blue
    dots (#306998) represent "Before Policy Changes" and yellow dots (#FFD43B) represent
    "After Policy Changes", connected by subtle gray lines. Departments are listed
    on the y-axis (Finance, Sales, Operations, Customer Support, Engineering, Marketing,
    Human Resources, Research & Development - sorted by improvement magnitude). The
    x-axis shows "Satisfaction Score" ranging from approximately 50 to 90. The title
    "dumbbell-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is at the top. A legend in the bottom right
    identifies the two dot colors.
