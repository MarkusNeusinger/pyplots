review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine style=left-right parameter for true split violins
  - Inner boxplots add valuable statistical detail (quartiles and outliers visible)
  - Clear color contrast between blue and yellow for accessibility
  - Realistic employee training scenario with meaningful before/after comparison
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper font sizing for all text elements
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entry order (After Training first) does not match intuitive temporal order
    (Before should come first)
  - Boxplots are slightly narrow and could be more prominent
  - Distribution shapes are somewhat similar across departments - more varied shapes
    would better demonstrate the plot type capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays split violin plots for four departments (Engineering,
    Marketing, Sales, Support) comparing employee satisfaction scores before and after
    training. Blue violin halves on the left represent "After Training" scores, while
    yellow/gold violin halves on the right represent "Before Training" scores. Each
    violin contains an inner boxplot showing quartiles and outliers (small gray dots).
    The title "violin-split · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The y-axis
    shows "Satisfaction Score (0-100)" ranging from about 25 to 100, and the x-axis
    shows "Department". A legend labeled "Period" appears on the right with "After
    Training" and "Before Training" entries. The grid lines are subtle and dashed.

        comment: Grid is subtle but legend order is reversed from visual (After Training
          shown first in legend but appears on left side of violins, which is correct
          but "Before Training" comes after in legend despite being on right)

        comment: Uses plotnine's grammar of graphics with geom_violin(style="left-right"),
          geom_boxplot, scale_fill_manual, and theme customization. Could leverage
          more plotnine-specific features.
  verdict: APPROVED
