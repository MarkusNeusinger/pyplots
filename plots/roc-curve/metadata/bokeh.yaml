review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with appropriate line widths and font sizes for the 3600x3600
    canvas
  - Correct implementation of ROC curve mathematics using parametric approach
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Good color choices that distinguish the three classifiers
  - Produces both PNG and HTML output showcasing Bokeh's dual output capability
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in extreme bottom-right corner; could be better placed inside
    the plot area or with more padding
  - Does not utilize Bokeh's interactive features like HoverTool to show threshold
    values on hover
