review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the efficient frontier with all required components
  - Uses Altair declarative layering (alt.layer) elegantly to combine scatter, lines,
    and points
  - Proper scipy optimization to calculate true efficient frontier (not approximation)
  - Capital Market Line correctly drawn from risk-free rate tangent to frontier
  - Good use of tooltips for interactive HTML version
  - Viridis colormap is both visually appealing and colorblind-accessible
  - Special portfolio markers (min variance, max Sharpe) are clearly distinguished
  weaknesses:
  - Having two separate legends (Sharpe Ratio + Key Portfolios) makes the right side
    slightly crowded
  - The risk-free rate diamond marker (yellow) could be more clearly labeled directly
    on the chart
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays an Efficient Frontier for Portfolio Optimization. The chart shows:
    - X-axis: Risk (Standard Deviation) ranging from 0.00 to 0.44
    - Y-axis: Expected Return ranging from 0.00 to 0.22
    - Scatter points: 300 random portfolios colored by Sharpe Ratio using a viridis colormap (yellow=high ~0.54, purple=low ~0.42)
    - Blue curve: The efficient frontier line (thick, ~4px stroke width) showing optimal portfolios from minimum variance to maximum return
    - Yellow dashed line: Capital Market Line (CML) extending from risk-free rate (0.02) at origin tangent to the frontier
    - Red marker: Minimum Variance portfolio (around risk=0.16, return=0.10)
    - Teal/green marker: Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio (around risk=0.19, return=0.12)
    - Yellow diamond: Risk-free rate point at (0, 0.02)
    - Title: "frontier-efficient · altair · pyplots.ai" in correct format
    - Legends: Two legends - "Sharpe Ratio" colorbar and "Key Portfolios" categorical legend
    - Grid: Subtle gray grid lines at ~30% opacity
    - Overall layout is well-balanced with good canvas utilization
