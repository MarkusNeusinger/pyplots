review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of timeline concept using scatter plot with alternating
    y-positions
  - Clean alternating label placement above/below axis prevents text overlap
  - Colorblind-safe palette correctly applied to 5 distinct categories
  - Proper use of Highcharts datetime axis with appropriate formatting
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Central axis line using plotLines is an elegant Highcharts feature
  - Large markers with white borders ensure visibility
  - Realistic software development milestone scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Missing explicit axis labels (y-axis is conceptual for timeline but VQ-06 criteria
    expects labels)
  - Slight excess bottom margin creates minor whitespace imbalance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization showing
    10 software development project milestones for 2024. Events are represented as
    colored circular markers positioned alternately above and below a central horizontal
    axis line. The title "timeline-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top in bold, with a subtitle "Software Development Project Milestones 2024" below.
    A horizontal legend at the top shows 5 color-coded categories: Planning (blue
    #306998), Design (yellow #FFD43B), Development (purple #9467BD), Testing (cyan
    #17BECF), and Release (brown #8C564B). Event labels are displayed near each marker
    with bold text. The x-axis spans from Dec 2023 to Feb 2025 with monthly tick marks.
    The background is white and the layout is clean with good use of space.'

        comment: No axis labels present (acceptable for timeline where x-axis is self-explanatory
          as dates, but y-axis concept is implicit).
