review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color contrast
  - LOWESS curve is visually distinct and captures the complex non-linear pattern
    smoothly
  - Clean, idiomatic Altair code using declarative layer composition
  - Proper use of frac=0.3 for balanced smoothness as specified
  - Good marker sizing and transparency for the data density (200 points)
  - Canvas utilization and layout are well balanced
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic rather than having real-world context with units
  - No interactive features like tooltips or zoom added despite Altair strength in
    interactivity
  - Markers use outline style which can be slightly less visible than filled markers
