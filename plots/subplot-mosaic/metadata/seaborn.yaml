review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of complex mosaic layout demonstrating the ASCII-art
    style pattern AAB;CCD;EFG
  - Clear visual hierarchy with larger overview panel at top and smaller metric panels
    at bottom
  - Professional color scheme using consistent Python-themed blue/yellow palette
  - Good use of height_ratios to create visual emphasis on different panels
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with appropriate data ranges
  - All seaborn plotting functions used correctly with modern API (hue parameter)
  weaknesses:
  - Main title font size (22pt) is slightly below the recommended 24pt for optimal
    legibility at 4800x2700
  - Could leverage more seaborn-distinctive features like regression lines, KDE overlays,
    or statistical annotations
  - Feature coverage could include additional plot types to better demonstrate mosaic
    flexibility
