review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's transform_loess for the LOESS smoothed trend line -
    a distinctive library feature
  - Proper layering architecture with alt.layer combining zero line, scatter points,
    and trend line
  - Symmetric y-axis range (-6 to 6) around zero as recommended in spec
  - Good heteroscedasticity pattern in data with intentional outliers for realistic
    diagnostics
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper data generation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (though for residuals this is often acceptable)
  - Data scenario is generic rather than tied to a specific real-world regression
    context
