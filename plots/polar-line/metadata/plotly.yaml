review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Python brand colors (blue/yellow) creating strong visual contrast
  - Clever data choice showing Northern vs Southern hemisphere temperature inversion
    - perfectly demonstrates cyclical data visualization
  - Proper loop closure by appending first value to create connected polar shape
  - Well-sized markers and lines for the 12-point data series
  - Complete spec compliance with correct title format and axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - City names are generic (City A, City B) rather than specific cities like Berlin
    and Sydney which would add realism
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates showing
    exact month/temperature values
