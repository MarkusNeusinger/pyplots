review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal dumbbell chart implementation following spec recommendations
    precisely
  - Data sorted by difference ascending effectively reveals the pattern of improvements
  - Color choice (blue/yellow) provides excellent contrast and colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic employee satisfaction scenario with plausible values
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear comments
  - Proper use of zorder to ensure dots appear above connecting lines
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more distinctive seaborn features like sns.set_style() or seaborn
    color palettes
  - X-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., Employee Satisfaction Score instead
    of just Satisfaction Score)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal dumbbell chart comparing employee
    satisfaction scores before and after policy changes across 10 departments. Blue
    dots (#306998) represent "Before Policy" values and yellow dots (#FFD43B) with
    gray edge outlines represent "After Policy" values. Gray connecting lines (#888888)
    link each pair of dots. Departments are listed on the y-axis (HR, Customer Support,
    Marketing, IT, Research, Legal, Finance, Operations, Sales, Engineering), sorted
    by the magnitude of improvement (ascending). The x-axis shows "Satisfaction Score
    (%)" ranging from approximately 50 to 90. The title "dumbbell-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in the lower right identifies the two
    data series. A subtle dashed vertical grid with alpha transparency aids readability.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot which is basic seaborn usage; could have used
          seaborn's built-in styling or color palettes more distinctively
