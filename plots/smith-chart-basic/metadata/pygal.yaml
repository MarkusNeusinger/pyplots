review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Smith chart grid structure with proper resistance
    circles and reactance arcs
  - Good use of pygal's styling system with custom colors matching pyplots branding
  - Realistic RF engineering data scenario with antenna impedance frequency sweep
  - 'Clear visual hierarchy: blue boundary > red data > gray grid'
  - Proper mathematical conversion from impedance to reflection coefficient
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses multiple helper functions instead of KISS inline structure
  - Frequency markers are only identified in legend, not labeled directly on the curve
    as spec requests
  - Chart dimensions (3600x3600) differ from standard pygal sizing (4800x2700)
  - Legend shows |Γ|=1 Boundary but special character may not render properly
  - No axis scale indicators showing normalized impedance values on the chart
  image_description: The plot displays a Smith chart implementation using pygal's
    XY chart type. The chart features a prominent blue circular boundary representing
    |Γ|=1 (total reflection). Inside, light gray dashed lines show constant resistance
    circles (R Grid) radiating from the center, and constant reactance arcs (X Grid)
    curving from the right edge. A dark gray horizontal real axis line passes through
    the center. The impedance locus (Antenna Z(f)) is shown in red/coral color as
    a connected curve with dots at each data point, displaying the frequency sweep
    trajectory of antenna impedance across 1-6 GHz. Three larger yellow/gold markers
    indicate key frequency points (1 GHz, 3.5 GHz, 6 GHz). The title "smith-chart-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark gray text. A legend at the bottom
    shows all six series in a 3-column layout.
