review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of the spec-compliant title format
  - Clean, readable axis labels positioned well around the perimeter
  - Good color choices with Python Blue as primary color and accessible complementary
    colors
  - Proper polygon closure with both fill (alpha=0.25) and outline (linewidth=3, markers)
  - Appropriate use of square figure format for radar chart
  - Clean seaborn styling with whitegrid theme and talk context
  weaknesses:
  - Data values are somewhat tightly clustered (65-90 range) which reduces the visual
    impact of comparing products - more dramatic variation would better showcase the
    radar chart strengths
