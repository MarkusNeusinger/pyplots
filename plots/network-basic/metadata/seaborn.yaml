review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed layout algorithm from scratch
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot with hue for community coloring and size for degree
    encoding
  - Clean legend showing only the group categories (filtered out size legend entries)
  - Appropriate color palette that is colorblind-friendly
  - Node labels are centered and readable with bold font
  - Network structure clearly shows the four communities with bridge connections
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels in dense areas (Leo/Jack/Mia region) have minor crowding
  - The force-directed algorithm implementation is quite verbose for a KISS-style
    script
