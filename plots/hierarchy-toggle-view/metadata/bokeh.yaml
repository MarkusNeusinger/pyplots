review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (CustomJS callbacks, Button widgets,
    visibility toggling)
  - Both treemap and sunburst views implemented with consistent color scheme
  - Good canvas utilization and clean visual layout
  - Realistic company budget data scenario
  - HTML version provides full interactivity as intended
  weaknesses:
  - 'Critical: Labels not visible in PNG export - the text renderers (treemap_labels_renderer,
    treemap_values_renderer) are not appearing in the exported PNG, making nodes unidentifiable'
  - Code uses functions (squarify, add_sunburst_wedges) violating KISS principle -
    should be inline code
  - Toggle buttons and interactive elements not visible in static PNG output
  - Similar yellow shades make some Engineering sub-departments hard to distinguish
  image_description: 'The plot displays a treemap visualization showing company budget
    allocation across departments and sub-departments. The treemap consists of 14
    nested rectangles representing leaf nodes (sub-departments), arranged using a
    squarified algorithm. Colors are used consistently: yellow shades for Engineering
    (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, QA), teal/green shades for Marketing (Digital, Content,
    Analytics), orange shades for Operations (Logistics, Facilities, Procurement),
    and purple shades for HR (Recruiting, Training, Benefits). The rectangles have
    white borders separating them, with a light gray (#fafafa) background. The title
    "hierarchy-toggle-view · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in blue at the top-left.
    Critical issue: No text labels are visible on the rectangles - the node names
    and values that should appear on each rectangle are missing from the PNG output,
    making it impossible to identify which rectangle represents which department without
    cross-referencing the colors.'
