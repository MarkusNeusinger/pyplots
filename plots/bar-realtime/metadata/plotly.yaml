review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of real-time data with ghosted previous state
    showing motion/transition
  - Clear change indicators with color-coded +/- values above bars
  - Live Updating annotation effectively conveys the dynamic nature for static output
  - Clean, professional layout with good use of the plotly_white template
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Legend colors do not accurately reflect all bar colors (shows gray/green but bars
    include red for decreases)
  - Green/red color scheme for increase/decrease may not be ideal for colorblind accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time updating bar chart showing service
    metrics (Requests per Second) for 6 services: API Gateway, Auth Service, Data
    Pipeline, Cache Layer, ML Engine, and Notification. The visualization uses an
    overlay technique with semi-transparent light blue/gray bars representing the
    "Previous State" and solid colored bars for the "Current State". Current state
    bars are colored green (#4CAF50) for increases and red (#F44336) for decreases.
    Each bar displays its current value (e.g., 847, 623, 1,152) with change indicators
    above showing the delta (e.g., +48, -54, -38, +1, +80, +37). A "◉ Live Updating"
    annotation in the top-left corner indicates the real-time nature. The title follows
    the required format "bar-realtime · plotly · pyplots.ai". The legend in the top-right
    shows "Previous State" and "Current State". The layout uses a clean white background
    with subtle horizontal gridlines.'
