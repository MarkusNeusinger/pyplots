review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data choices with four distinct distribution shapes (normal, bimodal,
    shifted normal, right-skewed) that showcase the violin plot ability to reveal
    distribution differences
  - 'All spec features implemented correctly: mirrored KDE, IQR quartile boxes, median
    lines'
  - Interactive HTML tooltips showing full statistics (n, mean, median, Q1, Q3, std
    dev) — meaningful use of Highcharts interactivity
  - Clean code structure with appropriate complexity for manual violin construction
  - Custom color palette with good contrast and cohesion
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick density is excessive (every 2 units from 0-106 = ~53 tick labels),
    creating visual clutter on the left side
  - Overall design polish is good but not publication-quality — needs more refined
    y-axis tick interval and visual refinement
  - Library mastery is adequate but could leverage more Highcharts-specific features
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin shapes representing test score
    distributions across four study groups: Control (dark blue, #306998), Tutorial
    (yellow/gold, #FFD43B), Self-Study (purple, #9467BD), and Intensive (cyan/teal,
    #17BECF). Each violin shows a mirrored KDE density shape with a dark IQR box in
    the center and a white horizontal median line. The Control group shows a symmetric
    normal distribution centered around 50. The Tutorial group displays a wider, bimodal
    distribution spanning roughly 10-85. Self-Study shows a tighter normal distribution
    centered around 60. Intensive shows a right-skewed distribution centered lower
    (~38) with a long upper tail reaching above 100. The title reads "violin-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" at the top center. Y-axis labeled "Test Score (points)"
    with ticks every 2 units from 0 to 106. X-axis labeled "Study Group". Legend in
    top-right shows all four categories plus "Median" entry. Background is white with
    subtle grid lines.'
