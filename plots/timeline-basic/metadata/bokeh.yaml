review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label positioning above/below axis prevents text overlap
  - Clean category color-coding with proper legend showing all 5 project phases
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for categorical grouping in scatter plot
  - Proper 4800x2700 sizing with appropriate font sizes for the canvas
  - Realistic software project milestone scenario with logical progression
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Event label font size (18pt) could be slightly larger for better readability at
    full resolution
  - Legend positioned far from data area in top-right corner
  - Could benefit from Bokeh-specific features like HoverTool for interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline visualization showing
    10 software project milestones from January 2024 to October 2024. A central blue
    horizontal line serves as the timeline axis. Events are represented by colored
    circular markers (size ~35) positioned alternately above and below the axis with
    vertical connector lines. The 5 project phases are color-coded using Category10
    palette: Planning (blue), Design (orange), Development (green), Testing (red),
    and Release (purple). Event labels appear above/below their respective markers.
    The title "timeline-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is displayed in blue (#306998)
    at the top center. A legend titled "Phase" in the top-right shows all categories.
    The x-axis displays dates with slight rotation, labeled "Date". Background is
    light gray (#fafafa) with dashed vertical grid lines.'

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, Label model, figure with datetime axis, legend
          configuration - good Bokeh usage but could leverage more interactive features
          or tooltips
