review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive collision detection system that keeps 27 labels readable in a crowded
    polar layout
  - Multi-encoding through seaborn scatterplot (hue, style, size) creates rich visual
    differentiation
  - Excellent data choice with real current technology innovations in a plausible
    ThoughtWorks-style radar format
  - 'Subtle design touches: pastel ring fills, marker halos, white-box labels with
    connectors, and color-coded sector headers'
  - Full spec compliance with all requested features including 270-degree layout,
    ring backgrounds, distinct markers, and combined legend
  weaknesses:
  - Innovation item labels at 12pt are slightly small for a dense polar chart; 13-14pt
    would improve readability
  - Collision detection helper functions break strict KISS structure though justified
    by the labeling challenge
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib for the core visualization limits seaborn-specific
    library mastery score
  - Minor label crowding in the Biotech sector where 3 items cluster at similar angles
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 270-degree polar radar chart on a white
    background with the title "radar-innovation-timeline · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at
    the top in bold ~26pt text. Four concentric rings are labeled "Adopt" (innermost),
    "Trial", "Assess", and "Hold" (outermost), with subtle pastel background fills
    (green, orange, yellow, pink respectively) separated by thin gray boundary lines.
    Four angular sectors divide the chart: "Sustainability" (green, top-left), "Cloud
    & Infra" (orange, top-right), "AI & ML" (blue, bottom-right), and "Biotech" (purple,
    bottom-left), with bold color-coded sector headers positioned along the outer
    edge. Twenty-seven labeled innovation items are plotted as colored markers — circles
    for AI & ML, squares for Cloud & Infra, diamonds for Sustainability, and triangles
    for Biotech — with marker sizes varying by ring importance (larger in Adopt, smaller
    in Hold). Each label has a white rounded background box connected to its marker
    by a thin gray line. A combined legend in the lower-right shows both sector colors/shapes
    and ring-size mapping. The overall layout is clean and well-organized with good
    use of the 270-degree arc to leave space for the legend.'
