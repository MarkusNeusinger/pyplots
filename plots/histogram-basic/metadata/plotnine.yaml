  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with correct title format, bin edges, and axis labeling
    with units
  - 'Exemplary code quality: clean KISS structure, reproducible seed, all imports
    used'
  - Idiomatic plotnine grammar of graphics with proper explicit font sizing for 4800x2700
    output
  - Good realistic data context (test scores) with appropriate scale and sample size
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add annotations for mean/median, distribution shape callout,
    or key statistics to guide the viewer'
  - 'Visual refinement is minimal beyond theme_minimal defaults: consider custom grid
    styling, spine removal, or whitespace tuning'
  - 'Data could show more histogram features: a slightly bimodal distribution or visible
    outlier region would better demonstrate the plot type'
  - Unused lower x-axis range (0-18) creates unbalanced whitespace on the left side
    of the plot
  - No distinctively plotnine features used (e.g., after_stat for density overlay,
    stat layers, or annotate)
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram of test scores (0-100 points) with
    25 bins using a muted steel blue fill (#306998 Python Blue) and white bar edges.
    The distribution is left-skewed, generated from a beta(5,3) distribution, peaking
    around 60-65 with frequencies reaching approximately 49. X-axis is labeled "Test
    Score (points)" with ticks every 10 units from 20 to 100. Y-axis is labeled "Frequency
    (count)" ranging from 0 to 50. The title reads "histogram-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    in the correct format. The plot uses theme_minimal providing a clean, light grid
    background. All text is clearly legible with explicitly set font sizes. Layout
    is 16:9 landscape format with reasonable proportions.
