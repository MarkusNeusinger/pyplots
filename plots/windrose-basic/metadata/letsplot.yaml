review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate implementation with correct North orientation and clockwise
    direction
  - Professional color scheme progressing from cool to warm that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic wind data simulation with Weibull distribution and direction-dependent
    speed variation
  - Clean 16-sector binning with appropriate speed categories matching meteorological
    conventions
  - Good use of coord_polar with proper start=0 and direction=1 parameters
  weaknesses:
  - No lets-plot distinctive features used (tooltips, interactivity exported to HTML
    could be enhanced)
  - Radial axis label Frequency (%) appears on left side which is unconventional for
    polar plots
  image_description: The plot displays a polar wind rose chart with North (N) at the
    top. The chart shows 16 direction sectors as stacked bar segments radiating from
    the center. The dominant wind directions are clearly NW (Northwest) and W (West),
    with bars extending to approximately 14% and 8% frequency respectively. Colors
    progress from cool blues (dark blue for 0-3 m/s, medium blue for 3-6 m/s, light
    blue for 6-9 m/s) to warm colors (yellow for 9-12 m/s, orange for 12-15 m/s, red
    for 15+ m/s). The 8 cardinal/ordinal direction labels (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W,
    NW) are positioned around the perimeter. The y-axis shows "Frequency (%)" ranging
    from 0 to 16. A legend titled "Wind Speed" appears on the right side showing all
    6 speed categories. The title "windrose-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top.
