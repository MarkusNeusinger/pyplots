review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of both vertical and horizontal spans with meaningful
    context (recession period + target zone)
  - Data clearly shows the effect of the recession with visible dip during the highlighted
    period
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  - Good color choices that are colorblind accessible
  - Appropriate alpha values (0.25 and 0.2) keep underlying data visible
  weaknesses:
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib axvspan/axhspan rather than seaborn-specific features;
    could explore seaborn fill_between or other native approaches to demonstrate library
    strengths
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing monthly sales data from
    2006 to 2011. There is a blue semi-transparent vertical span (light blue, #306998
    with alpha 0.25) highlighting the recession period from 2008 to 2009. A yellow
    horizontal span (#FFD43B with alpha 0.2) marks the target sales zone between 120-140
    thousand dollars. The blue line (matching #306998) shows sales values that clearly
    dip during the recession period and recover afterward, demonstrating the relationship
    between the highlighted region and the data trend. The title "span-basic · seaborn
    · pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. Axis labels show "Month" and
    "Sales (thousands $)" with clear, readable tick labels. A legend in the upper
    left identifies both span regions. The grid uses subtle dashed lines with low
    opacity.'
