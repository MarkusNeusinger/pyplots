review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine stage() function with after_scale for precise positional
    nudging of cloud and rain layers — a distinctive grammar-of-graphics technique
  - 'Strong data storytelling with two well-placed annotations: bimodal distribution
    callout with dashed leader lines, and treatment comparison note'
  - Bimodal distribution in Treatment B is a smart data design choice that demonstrates
    the raincloud plot key advantage over boxplots
  - Clean publication-quality aesthetic with custom color palette, refined typography
    hierarchy, and minimal chrome
  - 'Perfect raincloud metaphor: cloud (half-violin) rises above, rain (jitter) falls
    below each category baseline'
  weaknesses:
  - Annotation text sizes (10-11pt) are slightly small relative to the axis text (16pt);
    increasing to 12-13pt would improve readability at full resolution
  - The jittered points could be marginally larger (size 2.5-3.0) for better visibility,
    especially for Treatment B where points are more spread out
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction Time
    (ms) on the x-axis, rendered on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. Each condition
    has three layered components: a half-violin (cloud) extending upward from the
    category baseline, a thin white boxplot centered on the baseline, and jittered
    scatter points (rain) below the baseline. Control uses a deep blue (#2B5B8A) with
    a unimodal distribution centered around 450ms. Treatment A uses golden amber (#E8A838),
    shifted left to ~380ms. Treatment B uses muted green (#3A8A5C) with a visible
    bimodal shape showing peaks near 350ms and 500ms. Two italic annotations provide
    narrative: "Faster responses vs. Control →" near Treatment A, and "← Bimodal:
    two distinct response clusters" near Treatment B with dashed guide lines pointing
    to both peaks. Title reads "raincloud-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold at
    the top. Axis labels are bold: "Experimental Condition" (y) and "Reaction Time
    (ms)" (x). Grid shows only subtle horizontal lines. Overall layout is clean, well-proportioned,
    and publication-ready.'
