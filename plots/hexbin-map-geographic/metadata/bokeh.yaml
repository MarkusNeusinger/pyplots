review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh native hexbin utility and hex_tile glyph
  - Good clustered data generation simulating realistic urban hotspots
  - Interactive features (HoverTool) properly implemented for Bokeh
  - Clean well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Colorblind-safe viridis palette
  weaknesses:
  - Missing base map overlay - spec explicitly requires geographic context (coastlines,
    boundaries, or street map)
  - Title format incorrect - should not include NYC Taxi Pickups prefix, just the
    spec-id format
  - Color bar title (Pickup Count) appears cut off or barely visible at edge of image
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., should be Longitude degrees or Latitude degrees)
  image_description: The plot displays a hexagonal binning map showing NYC taxi pickup
    density. The visualization consists of approximately 100+ hexagonal cells arranged
    in a roughly organic shape representing the geographic distribution of pickup
    locations. The cells use a viridis-like color scale (purple/dark blue for low
    counts to yellow for high counts). Two distinct yellow/green hotspots are visible
    - one in the center-upper area and another in the center-left area, representing
    Midtown Manhattan and Greenwich Village areas respectively. The axes show Longitude
    (-74.1 to -73.85) on the x-axis and Latitude (40.7 to 40.8) on the y-axis. A color
    bar on the right shows "Pickup Count" ranging from approximately 50 to 250+. The
    title "NYC Taxi Pickups · hexbin-map-geographic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left. The background is a light gray (#f0f0f0) with subtle grid lines.
    The hexagons are rendered with slight transparency (alpha=0.85) and no edge lines,
    creating a clean appearance.
