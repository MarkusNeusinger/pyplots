quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent facet_grid implementation demonstrating lets-plot's ggplot2 grammar
  - Clean, professional visual design with theme_minimal
  - Realistic sales analysis scenario with meaningful variation across facets
  - Proper use of geom_smooth for trend lines within faceted panels
  - Good canvas utilization with ggsize(1600, 900) scaled 3x
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (yellow/red proximity)
  - Data generation uses for-loop which is less elegant than vectorized numpy/pandas
    operations
