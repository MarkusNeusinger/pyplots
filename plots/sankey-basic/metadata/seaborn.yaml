review:
  strengths:
  - Clean visual design with smooth bezier curves for flows
  - Good use of seaborn color palette (HUSL) for source differentiation
  - Node labels include values with units (TWh) for clarity
  - Proper alpha transparency (0.65) makes overlapping flows distinguishable
  - Well-proportioned layout with balanced margins
  weaknesses:
  - Legend implemented as a hidden barplot is unconventional; a simple legend with
    patches would be cleaner
  - Gray target nodes reduce visual distinction; could use a second seaborn palette
  - Code complexity is high due to manual Sankey implementation (seaborn lacks native
    support)
