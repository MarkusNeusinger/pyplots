review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent funnel visualization with clear stage progression from Awareness (1000)
    to Purchase (100)
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each stage (blue, yellow, purple,
    cyan, brown)
  - Data labels include both absolute values and percentages with clean connector
    lines
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  - Well-configured funnel neck (30% width, 25% height) creating visually appealing
    shape
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  - Good use of Highcharts FunnelSeries with proper configuration
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels positioned only on the right side, could be centered or inside segments
    for better balance
  - VQ-07 could be improved with subtle background styling or stage separators
  - Library features score could be higher by adding hover tooltips or animation effects
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a funnel chart with 5 sequential stages of a sales funnel. The title "funnel-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text. The funnel narrows from top to bottom with distinct colors for each stage:
    - **Awareness** (dark blue #306998): Widest segment at top, labeled "Awareness: 1,000 (43.5%)"
    - **Interest** (yellow #FFD43B): Second segment, labeled "Interest: 600 (26.1%)"
    - **Consideration** (purple #9467BD): Middle segment, labeled "Consideration: 400 (17.4%)"
    - **Intent** (cyan #17BECF): Narrow segment, labeled "Intent: 200 (8.7%)"
    - **Purchase** (brown #8C564B): Narrowest at bottom, labeled "Purchase: 100 (4.3%)"

    Data labels are positioned to the right of each segment with connector lines. The funnel shape is well-proportioned with a neck at the bottom. White background with good canvas utilization.
