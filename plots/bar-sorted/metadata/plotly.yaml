review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent horizontal bar orientation choice for category labels readability
  - Clean sorting implementation with numpy argsort
  - Professional appearance with Python Blue color scheme and subtle borders
  - Proper use of Plotly graph_objects for fine-grained control
  - Value labels positioned outside bars improve readability
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai standards
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for maximum utility
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (current alpha 0.1 is good but
    gridwidth=1 makes them slightly prominent)'
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal sorted bar chart showing "Monthly
    sales by product category" with 10 product categories arranged in descending order
    from top to bottom. Electronics leads with 450 (thousands USD), followed by Clothing
    (380), Home & Garden (320), Sports (280), Books (250), Toys (220), Beauty (195),
    Food & Grocery (170), Automotive (140), and Office Supplies (95) at the bottom.
    All bars are rendered in a consistent Python Blue (#306998) color with darker
    border lines. Value labels appear outside each bar to the right. The title "bar-sorted
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Sales (thousands
    USD)" ranging from 0 to ~500, and the y-axis shows "Product Category". The background
    uses Plotly's white template with subtle gridlines.
