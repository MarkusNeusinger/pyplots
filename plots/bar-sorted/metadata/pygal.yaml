review:
  strengths:
  - Clean descending sort implementation with explicit sorting code
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of custom Style with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible sales data
  - Proper use of HorizontalBar chart type for category readability
  - Value formatter configured for currency display
  weaknesses:
  - Category labels are only shown in legend, not on Y-axis of the bars; users must
    cross-reference legend to identify each bar
  - Each category added as separate series creates redundant legend instead of using
    x_labels for category names
  - Value labels on bars (print_values) are disabled despite spec notes recommending
    them for readability
