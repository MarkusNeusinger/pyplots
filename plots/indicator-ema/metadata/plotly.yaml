review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of EMA indicator with clear visual hierarchy (price line
    prominent, EMA lines thinner)
  - Crossover detection and highlighting with appropriate markers (triangle-up for
    golden cross, triangle-down for death cross)
  - Custom hover templates providing formatted dates and prices
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Plotly's strength
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Could add rangeslider for interactive time selection (Plotly's distinctive feature)
  - Legend with 5 items is slightly verbose; could consider grouping or repositioning
  image_description: 'The plot displays an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicator
    chart with stock price data from January 2024 to June 2024. The main price line
    is shown in a prominent dark blue color with a thicker line width (~3px). Two
    EMA lines are overlaid: EMA 12 (short-term) in yellow/gold color and EMA 26 (long-term)
    in red, both with thinner line widths (~2px). The chart shows an uptrend starting
    around $150, with a consolidation phase in the middle, then resuming the uptrend
    to reach approximately $188 by June 2024. Two crossover markers are visible: a
    green upward triangle (Golden Cross) near early January around $151 and another
    in early April around $156, plus a red downward triangle (Death Cross) in early
    March around $160. The title "indicator-ema · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The Y-axis shows "Price (USD)" with dollar-formatted values ($150-$190),
    and the X-axis shows "Date" with monthly intervals. A legend is positioned in
    the upper-left corner with a semi-transparent white background, showing all five
    series. The grid is subtle with light gray lines.'
