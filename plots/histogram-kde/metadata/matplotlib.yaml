review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent financial data simulation with mixture of normal, volatile, and extreme
    return periods creating realistic fat-tailed distribution
  - Manual KDE implementation using Scott's rule bandwidth is mathematically correct
    and educational
  - Perfect color contrast between blue histogram and yellow KDE line - colorblind
    accessible
  - 'All spec requirements met: semi-transparent bars (alpha=0.5), density scaling,
    KDE overlay, contrasting colors'
  - Professional appearance suitable for publication with proper axis labels including
    units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid legend styling could be slightly improved (legend box frame could have subtle
    background)
  - Manual KDE implementation, while correct, does not leverage scipy.stats.gaussian_kde
    which would be more robust
