review:
  strengths:
  - Clear monotonic PDP relationship that effectively demonstrates feature impact
    on predictions
  - Proper implementation of confidence intervals using individual predictions
  - Good use of rug plot to show training data distribution
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled font sizes for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Correct use of sklearn partial_dependence API with both average and individual
    kinds
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend dots are small and hard to distinguish at the bottom of the chart
  - Rug plot points could be slightly more prominent for better visibility
  - Grid styling is functional but the legend positioning creates visual separation
    from the data
