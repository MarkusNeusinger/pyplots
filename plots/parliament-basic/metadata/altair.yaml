review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular arrangement algorithm distributing 300 seats across 5 arcs
    proportionally
  - Legend displays party names with seat counts as specified in the requirements
  - Good use of Altair declarative grammar with proper encoding types and legend configuration
  - Clean color mapping using Scale with explicit domain and range
  - Appropriate circle size (250) and opacity (0.9) for the data density
  - Saves both PNG and HTML formats taking advantage of Altair interactive capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function instead of KISS inline structure (violates CQ-01)
  - Legend could be centered or better positioned to balance the layout
  - Political party theme may be considered sensitive per content policy (though fictional
    and neutral)
