review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn pairplot function, which is specifically designed for
    scatter matrices
  - Iris-like data is a perfect, realistic example that demonstrates species clustering
    and correlations
  - Clean implementation with appropriate sizing and transparency for the data density
  - KDE plots on diagonal with fill provide good visual distribution representation
  - Title format and axis labels with units are correct
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses two similar blues (Setosa and Virginica) which could be confusing;
    consider using three more distinct colors
  - Accessing private attribute g._legend is not ideal; consider using legend_data
    parameter or seaborn move_legend function
  - Marker size (s=80) could be slightly smaller given the data density in some cells
