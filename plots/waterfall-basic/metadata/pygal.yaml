review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-friendly color scheme using blue/teal/orange instead of problematic
    red/green
  - Creative use of StackedBar with invisible spacer series to achieve waterfall floating
    effect
  - Running totals displayed in x-axis labels provide excellent clarity for financial
    progression
  - Realistic quarterly financial breakdown scenario that demonstrates waterfall chart
    purpose well
  - Clean code structure with well-organized data processing logic
  weaknesses:
  - Empty spacer series appears in legend (should be hidden or legend entry suppressed)
  - Missing connecting lines between bars that spec suggests for emphasizing cumulative
    flow
  image_description: The plot displays a waterfall chart showing a quarterly financial
    breakdown from Q1 Revenue to Net Income. The chart uses a colorblind-friendly
    palette with blue for totals (Q1 Revenue starting at $500K, Net Income ending
    at $387K), teal for increases (Product Sales +$150K, Services +$80K, Other Income
    +$25K), and orange for decreases (COGS -$180K, Operating Exp -$120K, Taxes -$68K).
    Each bar is labeled with its value in white text. The x-axis labels include both
    category names and running totals in parentheses (e.g., "Q1 Revenue ($500K)").
    The y-axis is labeled "Amount ($K)" and the title correctly follows the format
    "waterfall-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai". A legend at the bottom shows Total, Increase,
    and Decrease categories.
