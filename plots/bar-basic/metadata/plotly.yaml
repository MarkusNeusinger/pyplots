review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for 4800x2700
    output
  - Clean plotly_white template with subtle gridlines produces a professional uncluttered
    look
  - Data sorted in descending order aids readability and implies ranking narrative
  - Dollar-formatted value labels above bars with texttemplate provide precise reading
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible sales figures
  - HTML export leverages Plotly native interactivity strength
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add an annotation highlighting a key insight (e.g. top
    performer gap between categories or a threshold line)'
  - Aesthetic sophistication is well-configured default level — consider subtle enhancements
    like rounded bar corners a gradient effect or a more refined color treatment to
    elevate beyond standard template
  - Could highlight one specific bar with a different color or opacity to draw attention
    as the spec suggests
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 8 product categories
    on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Automotive,
    Health) sorted in descending order by sales value. All bars use a single dark
    blue color (#306998 — Python Blue). Each bar has a dollar-formatted value label
    positioned above it (ranging from $45,200 for Electronics down to $15,400 for
    Health). The y-axis shows "Sales ($)" with dollar-formatted tick labels from $0
    to $45,000 and subtle gray gridlines. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category."
    The title "bar-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The background
    is clean white (plotly_white template) with good spacing between bars.
