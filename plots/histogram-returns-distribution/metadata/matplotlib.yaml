review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the core specification requirements with histogram,
    normal overlay, and statistics display
  - Good use of density normalization allowing histogram and normal curve to be on
    comparable scales
  - Effective fat-tail demonstration with t-distribution data (kurtosis of 35.85 clearly
    shows departure from normality)
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Statistics box is well-formatted with monospace font and professional styling
  - Tail highlighting with distinct yellow color is visually effective
  weaknesses:
  - 'Legend color mismatch: Actual Returns shows as yellow in legend but main histogram
    bars are blue (only tail bars are yellow)'
  - Only left tail region is annotated; should annotate both tail regions for symmetry
  - Extreme outlier at ~22% creates significant whitespace on right side of plot
  image_description: 'The plot displays a histogram of 252 simulated daily financial
    returns with density normalization. The histogram bars are rendered in a blue
    color (#306998) with white edges. Tail regions beyond ±2 standard deviations are
    highlighted in yellow (#FFD43B), clearly visible on both the far left (around
    -5%) and far right (around +5%, +7%, and +22%). A red dashed normal distribution
    curve is overlaid on the histogram, fitted to the data''s mean and standard deviation.
    A solid blue vertical line marks the mean (0.07%), while gray dotted vertical
    lines indicate the ±2σ boundaries. A statistics text box in the upper right corner
    (monospace font, white background with blue border) displays: Mean: 0.068%, Std
    Dev: 2.231%, Skewness: 3.895, Kurtosis: 35.850. The legend in the upper left shows
    three items: Actual Returns (yellow box - though the main histogram is blue),
    Normal Distribution (red dashed line), and Mean. The title correctly follows the
    format "histogram-returns-distribution · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". Axis labels
    are clear: "Daily Returns (%)" on x-axis and "Density" on y-axis. A "Tail Region
    (>2σ)" annotation appears in the lower left area. The data demonstrates clear
    fat-tail characteristics with extreme positive outliers around +7% and +22%, which
    clearly departs from the normal distribution overlay.'
