review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent title format following the exact spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, realistic data simulation with weekly patterns and upward trend demonstrating
    area chart utility
  - Proper semi-transparent fill (alpha 0.4) as recommended in spec
  - Good font sizing following the library guidelines (28pt title, 22pt labels, 18pt
    ticks)
  - Correct output dimensions (4800x2700 via 1600x900 scale=3)
  - HTML output also generated for interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label could be more descriptive (e.g., "Date (January 2024)" instead of
    just "Date")
  - Missing hover template customization which is a key Plotly strength
  - Could benefit from range slider or zoom capabilities to showcase Plotly interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart showing daily website visitors
    over January 2024 (30 days). The x-axis shows dates from Jan 2, 2024 to Jan 29,
    2024, and the y-axis shows "Visitors (daily count)" ranging from 0 to approximately
    7000. The area below the line is filled with a semi-transparent blue color (rgba
    blue, ~0.4 alpha), while the line itself is a darker blue (#306998). The data
    exhibits a clear weekly cyclical pattern (peaks and troughs repeating roughly
    every 7 days) along with an overall upward trend from ~5000 to ~7000 visitors.
    The title "Daily Website Visitors · area-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The background uses the plotly_white template with subtle light gray
    gridlines. The layout is clean with good margins and no overlapping elements.

        comment: Grid is subtle at alpha 0.1, but no legend shown (showlegend=False)
          - for a single series this is acceptable but loses points

        comment: Uses basic go.Scatter with fill, but doesn't leverage Plotly's interactive
          features like hover templates, range sliders, or annotations that would
          enhance the visualization
  verdict: APPROVED
