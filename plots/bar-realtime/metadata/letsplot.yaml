review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of real-time concept using ghosted bars for previous
    state
  - Clear color coding for positive/negative changes with corresponding change indicator
    labels
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with layer composition
  - Realistic service monitoring scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red color scheme may be difficult for colorblind users (consider blue/orange
    alternative)
  - No legend explaining what the ghost bars represent (new users may not understand)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time service metrics bar chart with
    6 services (API Gateway, Auth Service, Database, Cache, CDN, Worker). The implementation
    cleverly shows the "real-time" nature through a ghosted effect: lighter gray bars
    (alpha=0.25) represent previous values behind solid narrower bars showing current
    values. Current bars are colored green (#22C55E) for services with increased requests
    (API Gateway +24, Cache +27) and red (#EF4444) for decreased requests (Auth Service
    -8, Database -12, CDN -6, Worker -14). Each bar displays the current value in
    bold black text (342, 287, 198, 425, 156, 231) with change indicators in matching
    colors above. The title "bar-realtime · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is centered at
    the top. X-axis labels are rotated ~25° for readability. Y-axis shows "Active
    Requests" ranging from 0-500+. The minimal theme removes unnecessary grid lines
    while keeping horizontal guides. Overall layout is well-balanced with good use
    of canvas space.'
