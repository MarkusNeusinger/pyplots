review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn lineplot with hue and style parameters for multi-series
    visualization
  - Well-crafted synthetic data showing distinct patterns (growth, seasonal, stable)
    for each product line
  - Clear visual distinction between all 4 series with good color and marker choices
  - Appropriate text sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Realistic business context (monthly product sales) that demonstrates the plot
    type effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more seaborn-specific features like sns.set_theme() or custom context
    settings
  - The color palette is custom but not from seaborn recommended colorblind-safe palettes
