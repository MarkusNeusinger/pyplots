review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear contrast between scatter points, regression
    line, and confidence band
  - Complete implementation of all spec requirements including R² display, regression
    equation, and 95% CI
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores) with appropriate data
    scales
  - Clean, readable KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Proper font sizing for 4800×2700px output (title 24pt, labels 20pt, ticks 16pt)
  - Good use of alpha transparency for both points (0.7) and CI band (0.25)
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Study Hours (hrs)" and "Exam Score (points)")
  - Manual regression calculation rather than using scipy or numpy polyfit - works
    correctly but not leveraging library ecosystem
