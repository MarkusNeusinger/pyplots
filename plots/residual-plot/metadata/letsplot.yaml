review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including y=0 reference line,
    LOWESS smoothing, ±2σ outlier bands, and outlier coloring
  - Clear U-shaped LOWESS curve effectively demonstrates non-linearity detection in
    residuals
  - Good data generation with deliberate heteroscedasticity and non-linear term to
    showcase residual analysis
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar with proper lets-plot idioms
  - Proper sizing (1600x900 base with scale=3) for 4800x2700 output
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid alpha at 0.5 is slightly too prominent; recommended 0.2-0.4 for subtler appearance
  - Wildcard import pattern, while necessary for lets-plot, could be more explicit
  - Could leverage lets-plot interactive tooltips in HTML output for enhanced exploration
