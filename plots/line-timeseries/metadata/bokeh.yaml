review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing for 4800x2700 canvas - all text is highly readable
  - Smart date formatting with automatic month labels and rotation prevents overlap
  - Realistic stock price simulation with trend, seasonality, and noise components
  - Uses Bokeh-specific ColumnDataSource pattern correctly
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Clean, well-organized code structure following KISS principles
  - Good use of grid styling with dashed lines and appropriate alpha
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text size (28pt) appears small relative to other text elements on the canvas
  - HoverTool adds code complexity but provides no benefit in the static PNG output
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing stock price
    data over one year (January 2024 to January 2025). The line is rendered in a blue
    color (#306998) on a light gray background (#fafafa). The title "line-timeseries
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The y-axis is labeled "Stock
    Price (USD)" with values ranging from approximately 140 to 180. The x-axis is
    labeled "Date" with month labels (Jan 2024, Mar 2024, May 2024, Jul 2024, Sep
    2024, Nov 2024, Jan 2025) displayed at a slight angle. The chart shows a realistic
    stock price pattern with an initial sideways movement, a dip around May 2024,
    a strong recovery through August, and continued volatility through year-end. A
    legend labeled "Stock Price" appears in the top-left area. Grid lines are present
    with dashed styling on both axes.
