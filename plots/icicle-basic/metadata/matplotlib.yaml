review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart label truncation prevents overlap while keeping labels readable where space
    permits
  - Colorblind-safe palette with appropriate contrast (black text on yellow, white
    on others)
  - Good use of file system metaphor as realistic, neutral example data
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle with inline data processing
  - Level labels on right side provide helpful context for hierarchy depth
  weaknesses:
  - Item-level (depth 3) labels are heavily truncated to 1-2 characters, making them
    difficult to identify
  - No random seed statement (though data is deterministic, adding np.random.seed(42)
    comment would clarify intent)
  - Could use matplotlib colormap instead of manual color list for better scalability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal icicle chart representing a file
    system hierarchy with 4 depth levels. The root level (blue, #306998) spans the
    full width with "Root" label. The category level (yellow, #FFD43B) shows three
    main folders: "Documents", "Pictures", and "Music" with proportional widths. The
    subcategory level (teal, #4ECDC4) contains folders like "Reports", "Letters" (truncated
    to "Lett.."), "Spreadsheets" (truncated), "Photos", "Screenshots" ("Sc.."), "Icons"
    ("I.."), "Albums", "Playlists" ("P.."), and "Podcasts" ("Podca.."). The item level
    (coral, #FF6B6B) shows individual files with heavily truncated labels. Level hierarchy
    labels (Root, Category, Subcategory, Item) appear on the right side. Title is
    correctly formatted as "icicle-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'
