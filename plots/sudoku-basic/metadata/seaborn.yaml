review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual hierarchy with clear distinction between 3×3 box boundaries and
    cell boundaries
  - Numbers are large, bold, and highly readable with good color contrast
  - Clean monochrome design suitable for printing as specified
  - Uses square figure format (3600×3600 px equivalent) which is ideal for a Sudoku
    grid
  - Proper handling of empty cells (displayed as blank, not zeros)
  - Title follows correct format specification
  weaknesses:
  - Minimal use of seaborn distinctive features - sns.heatmap is only used to create
    a blank white grid, with all meaningful visualization done via matplotlib
