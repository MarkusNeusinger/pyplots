review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of interactive features: hover tooltips with detailed
    information (revenue, market share, YoY growth), click handling with point selection,
    visual hover feedback with brightness change'
  - Proper HTML export alongside PNG for true interactivity
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate font sizes for the 4800x2700
    canvas
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like custom tooltip formatting, data
    labels, and selection states
  - Realistic business data context with meaningful additional fields (percentages,
    growth)
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels could be slightly larger for better readability at the canvas
    size
  - Legend positioning at very bottom creates slight visual imbalance
  - List comprehension for data construction could be simplified
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical column chart with 8 product categories
    (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Food & Beverage, Health)
    on the x-axis and Sales Revenue ($) on the y-axis ranging from 0 to ~92,500. All
    bars are rendered in Python blue (#306998) with rounded corners. Each bar has
    a data label showing the exact dollar value (e.g., $87,500, $65,200). The title
    "bar-interactive · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a
    subtitle "Click bars to view details • Hover for tooltips" below it. The chart
    has a clean white background with subtle horizontal grid lines. A legend showing
    "2024 Sales" is positioned at the bottom center.
