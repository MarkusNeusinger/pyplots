review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (Python blue/gold) that are colorblind-friendly
  - Perfect implementation of the spec requirements including confidence bands via
    fill_between
  - Clean, readable KISS-style code structure with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Good data simulation showing realistic overfitting pattern with training scores
    staying high while validation improves with more data
  - Proper sizing for all visual elements (markers, lines, fonts) at 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could include units or clarification that it is a dimensionless score
  - Could add annotations to highlight the overfitting gap or key insights about the
    learning curve
  image_description: 'The plot displays a learning curve with two lines on a white
    background. The training score is shown in blue (Python logo blue, #306998) with
    circular markers and a light blue confidence band. The validation score is shown
    in yellow/gold (#FFD43B) with square markers and a corresponding light yellow
    confidence band. The x-axis shows "Training Set Size (samples)" ranging from 0
    to 1600, and the y-axis shows "Accuracy Score" ranging from approximately 0.55
    to 1.0. The title "learning-curve-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at
    the top. A legend in the lower right clearly identifies both curves. The training
    score starts around 0.88 and quickly rises to ~0.99, while the validation score
    starts around 0.67 and gradually increases to ~0.85, showing a classic overfitting
    pattern with a persistent gap between training and validation performance.'

        comment: Uses standard matplotlib features (fill_between, plot with markers)
          competently but doesn't leverage more advanced features like annotations,
          secondary axes, or custom styling
  verdict: APPROVED
