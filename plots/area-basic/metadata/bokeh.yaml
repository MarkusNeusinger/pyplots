  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with the 'Campaign launch +84%' annotation that provides
    context and guides the viewer's eye to the key insight
  - All text sizes explicitly set and well-scaled for 4800x2700 canvas — title 42pt,
    labels 32pt, ticks 26pt
  - 'Strong idiomatic Bokeh usage: ColumnDataSource, varea, HoverTool with datetime
    formatters, Label model, HTML export'
  - 'Clean visual refinement: subtle grid (alpha 0.2), removed outline, styled axis
    lines, hidden toolbar'
  - Realistic data with weekly cyclical pattern, upward trend, and viral spike creating
    a compelling narrative
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Bokeh's interactive strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label 'Daily Visitors' lacks explicit units (could be 'Daily Visitors (count)')
  - '''Date'' x-axis label is somewhat generic'
  - Slight vertical whitespace above annotation due to y_range padding
  - Could leverage more distinctive Bokeh features like Band glyph for confidence
    intervals or CustomJS for richer interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a basic area chart titled "Daily Website Traffic
    · area-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai". The x-axis shows dates from Jan 01, 2024 to
    Feb 01, spanning one month with datetime formatting. The y-axis shows "Daily Visitors"
    ranging from 0 to approximately 10,500. The area is filled with a semi-transparent
    Python Blue (#306998) at approximately 0.4 alpha, with a solid blue line (width
    5) tracing the top edge. The data shows a clear upward trend combined with weekly
    cyclical patterns (peaks and troughs roughly every 7 days). A dramatic spike appears
    around Jan 18, reaching approximately 9,200 visitors, annotated with bold text
    reading "Campaign launch +84%". Grid lines are subtle (alpha 0.2). The plot frame
    outline is removed for a clean look. The toolbar is hidden. Text sizes are generous
    — title at 42pt, axis labels at 32pt, tick labels at 26pt — all clearly legible
    at the 4800x2700 canvas size.
