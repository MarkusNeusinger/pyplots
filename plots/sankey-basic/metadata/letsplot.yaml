review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual Sankey implementation using geom_polygon for smooth bezier flows
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct node bars and semi-transparent flows
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible
  - Informative labels showing both names and total values (TWh units)
  - Proper canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Clean separation between flow calculation and visualization code
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - Some minor whitespace imbalance (more space at bottom due to legend placement)
