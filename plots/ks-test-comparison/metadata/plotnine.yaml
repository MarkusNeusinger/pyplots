review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: all required features (ECDFs, K-S statistic, max divergence
    highlight, p-value) are implemented correctly'
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario with plausible data distributions (beta distributions
    for Good/Bad customers)
  - Good typography hierarchy with explicitly set font sizes at all levels
  - Clean, refined grid styling with only subtle horizontal gridlines
  - Proper use of plotnine's grammar of graphics with layered composition
  weaknesses:
  - 'Data storytelling is weak: the K-S statistic annotation text blends into the
    background and the max divergence line is visually subtle — the viewer''s eye
    isn''t guided to the key insight'
  - 'Layout balance could be improved: some wasted whitespace in the lower-left quadrant,
    and the annotation text position doesn''t use available space well'
  - The legend title 'Distribution' is generic — could be more descriptive
  - 'Visual refinement could go further: spines still visible, no additional polish
    like shaded region between the two CDFs at the max divergence point'
  image_description: 'The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) rendered as step functions comparing credit score distributions for "Good
    Customers" (blue, #306998) and "Bad Customers" (orange, #E8873D). A red dashed
    vertical line at approximately x=620 marks the point of maximum divergence between
    the two distributions. The label "D = 0.730" appears in red next to this vertical
    line. In the lower-right area of the plot, bold dark text displays "K-S Statistic
    = 0.730" and "p-value = 9.54e-78". The title "ks-test-comparison · plotnine ·
    pyplots.ai" is displayed in bold at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Credit Score"
    (range ~200–1000), and the y-axis "Cumulative Proportion" (0.0–1.0) with gridlines
    at 0.2 intervals. A legend in the upper-left shows "Bad Customers" and "Good Customers"
    with the legend title "Distribution". The background is clean with only subtle
    horizontal gridlines.'
