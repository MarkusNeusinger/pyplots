review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of bimodal distribution to demonstrate density plot capabilities
  - Clean, readable visualization with appropriate text sizing for high-resolution
    output
  - Good color choices (Python blue + yellow) that are accessible and visually appealing
  - Rug plot addition enhances the visualization by showing individual observations
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics (ggplot + geom_density + geom_rug)
  - Code follows KISS principle perfectly
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Test Score (points) would be more complete)
  - Could demonstrate more plotnine-specific features like fill gradients or bandwidth
    adjustments
  - Minor excess whitespace on the right edge of the plot
