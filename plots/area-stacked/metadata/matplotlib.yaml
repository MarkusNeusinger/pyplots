review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world context using website traffic sources over 24 months
  - Perfect title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Y-axis correctly starts at zero to avoid misleading proportions
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.85) for the stacked areas
  - Legend is well-positioned and non-intrusive
  - Proper ordering of series by size (largest at bottom)
  weaknesses:
  - Series sizes are relatively similar which does not dramatically showcase the stacking
    effect; more variation between categories would better demonstrate how parts contribute
    to whole
  - Axis labels lack units
  - Could benefit from more distinct color separation between adjacent green and purple
    bands for colorblind accessibility
