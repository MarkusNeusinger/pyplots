review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent peak annotation with clear yellow arrows pointing to dominant frequencies
  - Clean dB scale calculation with proper normalization and epsilon for log safety
  - Realistic synthetic signal with three distinct frequency components plus noise
  - Proper use of FFT with rfft/rfftfreq for real-valued signals
  - Well-proportioned fill area under the curve enhances visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Plotly's interactive features (hover tooltips showing exact
    dB values, zoom capabilities display)
  - Grid transparency could be more subtle (currently visible but not obtrusive)
