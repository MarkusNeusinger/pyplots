review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent four-panel layout with shared x-axis showing all decomposition components
    clearly
  - Realistic retail sales scenario with trend, annual seasonality, and December holiday
    bumps
  - Clean code structure using statsmodels seasonal_decompose for proper decomposition
  - Appropriate line widths and grid styling for readability
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis labels lack units (e.g., "Original (Sales USD)" would be more informative)
  - Uses two similar yellow shades for Trend and Residual which could be slightly
    confusing
  - Tick labels at 14pt are slightly below the 16pt guideline
  - Could leverage more matplotlib features like annotations or fill_between for visual
    enhancement
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked subplots sharing a common time axis (2018-2024). The **Original** series
    (blue, #306998) shows monthly retail sales data ranging from ~90 to ~200 with
    clear seasonal patterns and an upward trend. The **Trend** component (yellow/gold,
    #FFD43B) shows a smooth upward trajectory from ~110 to ~165. The **Seasonal**
    component (blue, #4B8BBE) displays repeating annual cycles oscillating between
    approximately -30 and +25, with visible December holiday bumps. The **Residual**
    component (yellow/gold, #FFE873) shows random noise fluctuating around a zero
    reference line (gray), ranging from approximately -15 to +15. All subplots have
    dashed grid lines (alpha 0.3), clear y-axis labels (Original, Trend, Seasonal,
    Residual), and the bottom subplot includes a "Date" x-axis label. The title "timeseries-decomposition
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is clearly displayed at the top.'
