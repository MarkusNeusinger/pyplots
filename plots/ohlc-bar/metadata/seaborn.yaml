review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent OHLC bar implementation with proper open/close tick positions
  - Good colorblind-friendly color scheme (Python Blue and soft red)
  - Realistic synthetic stock data with clear price movements
  - Clean, well-commented code following KISS principles
  - Proper seaborn styling integration with whitegrid theme
  weaknesses:
  - Legend uses square markers that do not visually represent the actual OHLC bar
    style (should use custom legend with line markers)
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib primitives since seaborn lacks native OHLC support
  image_description: 'The plot displays a professional OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close)
    bar chart spanning 45 trading days from January 2 to late February 2024. Each
    bar consists of a thin vertical line representing the high-low price range, with
    a horizontal tick extending left for the open price and right for the close price.
    Up bars (close ≥ open) are colored in Python Blue (#306998) and down bars (close
    < open) are in a soft red (#C44E52). The data shows a clear downtrend from approximately
    $165 to $130 over the period. The chart uses a whitegrid seaborn style with subtle
    dashed gridlines (alpha 0.3). Axis labels are properly formatted with "Date" on
    x-axis and "Price ($)" on y-axis. The legend in the upper left clearly explains
    the color coding. The title correctly follows the required format: "ohlc-bar ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai".'
