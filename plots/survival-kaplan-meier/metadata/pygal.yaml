review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Kaplan-Meier step functions with proper survival probability
    calculation
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette that provides good visual distinction between
    groups
  - Properly includes 95% confidence intervals using Greenwood formula
  - Censored observations are marked on the curves as specified
  - Well-structured code with clear comments explaining each section
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with appropriate sample sizes and survival time
    distributions
  weaknesses:
  - CI bands shown as dashed lines instead of shaded regions (specification requests
    shaded bands)
  - Legend has 6 entries making it cluttered; CI bounds and censored markers could
    be styled without separate legend entries
  - Censored observations shown as dots rather than traditional vertical tick marks
    on the curve
  - Grid and legend placement could be improved; legend at bottom with 3 columns is
    visually heavy
