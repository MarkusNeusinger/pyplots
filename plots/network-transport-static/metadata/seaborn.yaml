review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-positioned station labels and readable edge
    annotations
  - Proper handling of parallel routes with perpendicular offset calculation
  - Good color scheme that is colorblind-accessible (blue, green, yellow)
  - Clean KISS code structure with clear data separation
  - Title follows the exact required format
  - Realistic transportation network scenario with plausible times and station names
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap between some station labels and edge labels, particularly around
    Park Station and University
  - Edge label font size (9pt) is slightly small relative to other text elements
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; most drawing relies on matplotlib primitives
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a regional rail network diagram with 10 stations (labeled A through J) positioned according to their x/y coordinates. Stations are rendered as dark blue circular nodes (Python Blue #306998) with white single-letter identifiers centered inside. Each station has a labeled name box positioned above it (e.g., "Central Station", "North Terminal", "Airport").

    Routes are visualized as directed arrows connecting stations, color-coded by type: blue for Regional Express (RE), green (Sea Green) for Local Service (S), and yellow (Python Yellow) for Express (EX). Each route edge displays a label box showing the route ID and times in the format "RE 01\n06:00→06:18". Multiple routes between the same stations are properly offset using parallel edges.

    The legend in the lower right explains the three route types. The title reads "Regional Rail Network · network-transport-static · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in large bold text at the top. The background is white with no grid (axes are turned off). The overall layout is clean and readable.
