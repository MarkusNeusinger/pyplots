review:
  strengths:
  - Clean visual design with proper range selector buttons that are clearly visible
    and well-positioned
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriate font sizes throughout
  - Good data generation showing realistic time series with trend, seasonality, and
    noise
  - Proper use of seaborn lineplot with matplotlib integration for button elements
  - Fill area under the line enhances visual appeal and data representation
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., Value USD or Price would be more informative)
  - Relies heavily on matplotlib patches for buttons rather than seaborn-specific
    features
  - Could not demonstrate animation feature (inherent limitation of static output)
  image_description: The plot displays a time series line chart showing approximately
    1 year of daily data (from 2024-01-18 to 2025-01-12). The line is rendered in
    a blue color (#306998) with a light blue semi-transparent fill area beneath it.
    The data shows an upward trend with seasonal oscillations and daily noise, values
    ranging from approximately 135 to 182. At the top of the figure, there are 6 range
    selector buttons (1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, All) displayed as rounded rectangles. The
    '1Y' button is highlighted in blue with white text (indicating it's the active
    selection), while the other buttons are gray with dark text. The title 'line-range-buttons
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai' is centered below the buttons. Axis labels are 'Date'
    (x-axis) and 'Value' (y-axis). The x-axis dates are rotated approximately 30 degrees
    for readability. A subtle gray grid is visible in the background.
