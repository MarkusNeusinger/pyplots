review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style visualization with proper size encoding
    via node radius
  - Year watermark (2021) clearly indicates the time point shown in the static preview
  - Interactive HTML version with slider controls matches the spec animation requirement
    perfectly
  - Clean color scheme with good colorblind accessibility
  - Proper use of pygal Style system for consistent large-canvas formatting
  - Comprehensive tooltips showing country name, GDP, life expectancy, and population
  weaknesses:
  - Legend marker squares at the bottom are too small/barely visible - the colored
    indicator dots should be larger for better readability
  - Some of the smaller data points (particularly the tiny ones for Region 3) could
    benefit from slightly larger minimum sizes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot showing country development
    metrics for year 2021. It features 12 data points representing countries, plotted
    with GDP per Capita (thousands USD) on the x-axis (ranging 0-50) and Life Expectancy
    (years) on the y-axis (ranging ~50-90). Points are color-coded by region: Region
    1 in dark blue (#306998), Region 2 in yellow/gold (#FFD43B), and Region 3 in olive
    green (#6B8E23). Point sizes vary based on population, with the largest point
    being a green circle around (30, 80). A large semi-transparent "2021" watermark
    appears in the lower-right area of the plot. The title correctly shows "scatter-animated-controls
    · pygal · pyplots.ai". The legend appears at the bottom with all three regions.
    Grid lines are subtle and dotted.'
