quality_score: 96
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with geom_jitter for strip plot
  - Realistic survey score data with distinct distributions per department showing
    the plot type strengths
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate grid styling (horizontal only)
  - Proper reproducibility with fixed seeds in both numpy and geom_jitter
  - Well-calibrated jitter width (0.25) and alpha (0.6) per spec recommendations
  weaknesses:
  - 'No legend present (minor: single-color plot does not strictly require one)'
  - Point size could be slightly larger for better visibility at full 4800x2700 resolution
