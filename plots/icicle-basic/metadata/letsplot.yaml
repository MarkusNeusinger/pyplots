review:
  strengths:
  - Clean hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Intelligent label visibility logic that hides labels for narrow rectangles to
    prevent overlap
  - Good color scheme with Python-themed colors (blue/yellow) that are colorblind-safe
  - Proper horizontal orientation with root at top as specified
  - Well-structured code using stack-based traversal instead of recursion
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be more descriptive (e.g., "Hierarchy Level" instead of just "Level")
  - Some empty space at the bottom of the canvas could be better utilized
  - Several level 3 labels are hidden (Reports, Contracts, Letters, Receipts, 2024,
    2023, Movies, DataViz, Frontend, Backend) - while this prevents overlap, it reduces
    information density
