review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of arc diagram concept with Bezier curves for smooth
    arcs
  - Good use of color coding to distinguish long-range vs short-range connections
  - Arc height correctly proportional to distance between connected nodes
  - Weight-based line thickness effectively shows connection strength
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic data scenario (character interactions) makes the visualization meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the color coding (yellow=long-range, blue=short-range
    connections)
  - Node labels at 16pt could be increased to 18-20pt for better readability at full
    resolution
  - Significant empty whitespace above the tallest arc could be reduced by adjusting
    y_range
