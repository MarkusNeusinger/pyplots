review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of small multiples approach (per spec recommendation for libraries
    without animation)
  - Good realistic earthquake aftershock scenario with temporal spreading pattern
  - Effective use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Good geographic context with California coastline basemap
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Size legend is suppressed; showing both color and size mapping would be clearer
    for readers
  - No visible grid lines in the plot panels (subtle grid would improve readability)
  - Some point overlap in dense areas (Day 2) makes individual events harder to distinguish
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x2 grid of small multiples showing an earthquake
    aftershock sequence across California over 6 days (Day 1: Mar 01 through Day 6:
    Mar 06). Each panel contains a simplified California coastline rendered as a dark
    gray path providing geographic context. Aftershock events are shown as scatter
    points colored using the viridis colormap (purple for lower magnitudes ~5-6, teal/green
    for medium ~7-8, yellow for high ~10+), with point size also encoding magnitude.
    The visualization clearly shows the temporal evolution: early days have more concentrated,
    higher-magnitude events near the epicenter (around 36°N, -118.5°W), while later
    days show events spreading geographically with generally decreasing magnitudes.
    The title "Earthquake Aftershock Sequence · map-animated-temporal · plotnine ·
    pyplots.ai" is prominently displayed at the top. Axes show Longitude (°) and Latitude
    (°) with proper units. A colorbar legend for Magnitude appears on the right side.'
