review:
  strengths:
  - Successfully implements centered streamgraph effect using pygal StackedLine with
    baseline offset calculation
  - 'Excellent use of pygal-specific features: custom Style, cubic interpolation,
    dual PNG/HTML output'
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Realistic music streaming scenario with seasonal variation and trends
  - Proper title format and clear legend placement
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis major labels are truncated (Jan... instead of full Jan 23) reducing readability
  - Adjacent layer colors (particularly green-purple and orange-blue boundaries) could
    have stronger contrast for better visual separation
  - Y-axis range (-100, 100) creates unused whitespace at extremes since data does
    not fill the full range
