review:
  strengths:
  - Full spec compliance with all required features (270-degree layout, 4 rings, 4
    sectors, color and shape encoding, legends)
  - Excellent data choices with realistic, current technology names and plausible
    ring assignments
  - Subtle ring fill gradients with decreasing opacity create effective visual depth
  - White marker strokes and distinct shapes per ring aid readability
  weaknesses:
  - Label overlap in the Adopt ring area where multiple items crowd together (Data
    Contracts, Platform Eng., Edge Computing)
  - Large whitespace gap between the radar and the bottom-left legend wastes canvas
    area
  - Item label font size (12pt) could be increased for better legibility
  - Ring labels positioned at edge could be more prominently placed (e.g., inside
    the ring bands)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar-style innovation chart rendered on
    a 270-degree arc. Four concentric rings represent time horizons: Adopt (innermost,
    with the strongest blue fill), Trial, Assess, and Hold (outermost, nearly transparent
    fill). Four angular sectors divide the chart: Data Engineering (upper-left), Cloud
    & Infra (upper-right), Security (lower-left), and AI & ML (lower-right). Each
    sector is separated by grey spoke lines emanating from the center. 25 technology
    items are plotted as colored, shaped markers: blue circles/diamonds/triangles/squares
    for AI & ML, orange for Cloud & Infra, green for Data Engineering, and purple
    for Security. Marker shapes encode rings (circle=Adopt, diamond=Trial, triangle=Assess,
    square=Hold). Each item has a text label above it. The title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. Two legends at the bottom-left show
    Sector (color) and Ring (shape) mappings. There is notable label crowding in the
    Adopt ring where items like "Data Contracts", "Platform Eng.", and "Edge Computing"
    overlap.'

        comment: Font sizes explicitly set (title=28, sector=22, ring=16, items=12,
