quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: regression line, confidence
    band, R² value, and equation annotation'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good color contrast between blue scatter points and yellow regression line
  - Realistic educational scenario with plausible data distribution
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and Band for the confidence interval
  weaknesses:
  - Some exam scores exceed 100% which is unrealistic for percentage scores
  - Legend positioned far from the annotation; could be consolidated or moved closer
    to the statistical information
  - Does not leverage Bokeh distinctive interactive features (hover tooltips showing
    point values would enhance the visualization)
