review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic context with simplified coastline outlines providing world
    map orientation
  - Clear population category differentiation through both size and color encoding
  - Good use of pygal custom Style for font sizing and colors appropriate for high
    resolution
  - Real-world data with actual city population figures adds credibility
  - Proper handling of pygal module name conflict
  weaknesses:
  - Title format should be exactly "{spec-id} · {library} · pyplots.ai" without prefix
    text
  - Grid lines not visible despite being enabled in configuration
  - Smallest bubbles (5-12M population) are relatively hard to see compared to mega
    cities
  - No explicit size legend showing the value-to-size relationship as spec recommends
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map with bubble markers representing
    major city populations. The background is a light blue (#C8DDF0) representing
    oceans, with gray simplified coastline outlines for continents (North America,
    South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia). Cities are represented as colored
    bubbles with four size categories: small blue dots for populations under 12M (Paris,
    London, Sydney, Seoul, Bangkok, Jakarta), medium blue dots for 12-20M (Moscow,
    Istanbul, Lagos, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles), yellow dots for 20-30M (Mexico City,
    Cairo, Mumbai, Beijing, Shanghai, New York, Delhi), and large red-orange dots
    for populations over 30M (Tokyo). The x-axis shows Longitude (-160 to 160°), y-axis
    shows Latitude (-60 to 80°). A legend at bottom shows all four population categories.
    The title correctly follows the format "World City Populations · bubble-map-geographic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai".'
