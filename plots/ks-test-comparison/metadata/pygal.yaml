review:
  strengths:
  - 'Complete spec compliance: all required KS test features (ECDFs, D statistic,
    p-value, max divergence line) are present and clearly displayed'
  - Thoughtful color palette with blue/orange colorblind-safe pair and green for the
    KS annotation creating visual hierarchy
  - Clean vectorized numpy code for ECDF computation and step-function construction
  - Effective use of pygal-specific label dicts to annotate the KS statistic and p-value
    directly on the plot
  - Realistic credit scoring scenario with appropriate data parameters
  weaknesses:
  - The D=0.657 and p=1.93e-61 labels appear relatively small compared to the axis
    labels, making the key statistical results less prominent than ideal
  - Left margin (180px) and bottom margin (180px) are generous, slightly reducing
    the plot area proportion
  - The ECDF lines appear somewhat jagged/thin — the step-function rendering could
    be smoother or the lines more prominent for a more polished look
  - The legend color squares are small (legend_box_size=28) relative to the overall
    chart size, making the legend feel understated
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step-function lines on a light gray (#fafafa) plot background with
    a white canvas. The title reads "ks-test-comparison · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the
    top in dark text. The X-axis is labeled "Credit Score (points)" ranging from approximately
    250 to 950, and the Y-axis is labeled "Cumulative Proportion" ranging from 0 to
    1. The blue line represents "Good Customers" and the orange/burnt-orange line
    represents "Bad Customers." A green dashed vertical line marks the point of maximum
    divergence between the two distributions (around credit score ~570). Two large
    green dots sit at the endpoints of this vertical line, annotated with "D = 0.657"
    at the bottom and "p = 1.93e-61" at the top. A legend at the bottom of the chart
    identifies the two series with colored squares. The grid uses subtle horizontal
    gray lines. The overall layout is clean and professional with well-proportioned
    margins.
