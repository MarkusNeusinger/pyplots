review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario using website traffic by hour which perfectly demonstrates
    cyclical nature of polar charts
  - Beautiful visual design with viridis colormap providing both aesthetic appeal
    and colorblind accessibility
  - Proper polar configuration with theta offset at top (12 o'clock) and clockwise
    direction for time-based data
  - Smart combination of scatter points, connecting line, and filled area to create
    rich visualization
  - Appropriate marker sizing (s=300) and alpha (0.8) for 24 data points
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn is primarily used for styling (set_theme, set_context, color_palette)
    rather than its distinctive plotting functions - this is acceptable since seaborn
    lacks native polar plot support
  - The Visitors y-axis label position on the right side is unconventional for polar
    plots
  - Grid style uses dashed lines which could be simplified to solid with lower alpha
  image_description: The plot displays a polar chart showing website traffic by hour
    of day. The chart uses a viridis colormap with colors ranging from purple/dark
    blue (lower traffic ~100) to yellow (higher traffic ~200+). Data points are shown
    as large circular markers with dark blue (#306998) borders, connected by a continuous
    line with the same blue color. The area under the curve is filled with a light
    blue transparent fill. Hour labels (00:00 through 23:00) are positioned around
    the circumference in clockwise direction starting from 00:00 at the top. Radial
    gridlines show values at 50, 100, 150, and 200. The title "Website Traffic by
    Hour · polar-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A colorbar on the
    right shows "Traffic Volume" with the viridis scale. The y-axis label "Visitors"
    appears on the right side. The traffic pattern clearly shows peaks around 19:00-21:00
    (evening) with the highest yellow points, and moderate activity during morning
    hours.
