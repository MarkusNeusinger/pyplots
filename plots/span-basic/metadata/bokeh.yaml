review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh BoxAnnotation for both vertical and horizontal spans
  - Clean, realistic data scenario (monthly revenue with business-relevant highlights)
  - Proper text sizing for 4800x2700 resolution
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (blue/yellow)
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in bottom-right corner creates slight visual imbalance
  - Vertical span label Q4 Peak Season positioned at bottom of span could be more
    prominently placed
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing monthly revenue data
    over 24 months (labeled 1-25 on x-axis). The chart features two span annotations:
    a **blue vertical span** covering months 10-12 labeled "Q4 Peak Season" and a
    **yellow horizontal span** covering the revenue range 120-140 labeled "Target
    Range". The line is blue (#306998) with circular markers at each data point. The
    y-axis shows "Revenue (thousands $)" ranging from ~100 to ~143. The title correctly
    displays "span-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" in the top-left. A legend labeled "Monthly
    Revenue" appears in the bottom-right corner. The overlapping region of the two
    spans creates a mixed green-gray color. Overall layout is clean with good use
    of the canvas space.'
