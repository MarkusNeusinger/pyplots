review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a complex visualization with both row and column dendrograms
  - Proper hierarchical clustering using scipy with Ward's method and Euclidean distance
    as specified
  - Clean diverging colormap centered at zero for expression data
  - Good use of Altair's compositional operators (hconcat, vconcat) to create the
    multi-chart layout
  - Tooltips added for interactivity showing gene, sample, and expression values
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar legend could benefit from more prominent formatting
  - The dendrogram line thickness could be slightly reduced for visual elegance
  - Missing interactive zoom/pan features that Altair supports
