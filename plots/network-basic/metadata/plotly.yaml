review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of force-directed layout algorithm from scratch
  - Node sizing based on degree effectively highlights well-connected individuals
  - Clean four-color palette that is colorblind accessible
  - Proper use of separate traces for legend grouping by community
  - Interactive HTML output generated alongside PNG
  - Hover text shows connection count for each node
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific interactive features (click-to-highlight neighbors,
    draggable nodes)
  - Network is positioned diagonally leaving some canvas corners empty
  - All community groups have exactly 5 members and 6 internal edges - more variation
    would better demonstrate the network concept
