review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation with curved connection lines and appropriate transparency
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot for airport markers with proper styling
  - Well-designed legend showing passenger volume ranges
  - Appropriate label offsets to avoid overlap in crowded regions (Europe/Asia)
  - Realistic flight route data with plausible passenger counts
  weaknesses:
  - Simplified continent outlines are rough approximations rather than accurate coastlines
  image_description: "The plot displays a world map showing flight connection lines\
    \ between major international airports. The background features simplified gray\
    \ continent shapes representing North America, South America, Europe, Africa,\
    \ Asia, and Australia. \n\nTen airports are marked with bright yellow circular\
    \ markers with blue borders: Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt,\
    \ Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, and Sydney. Each city is labeled in bold\
    \ dark gray text with custom offsets to avoid overlap.\n\nBlue curved lines (Bezier\
    \ curves) connect the airports, representing flight routes. The line thickness\
    \ varies based on passenger volume - thinner lines for routes with ~350k passengers\
    \ and thicker lines for routes with ~850k passengers. The lines use transparency\
    \ (alpha ~0.4) to handle overlapping routes effectively.\n\nThe title reads \"\
    map-connection-lines · seaborn · pyplots.ai\" in bold at the top. Axis labels\
    \ show \"Longitude (°)\" on the x-axis and \"Latitude (°)\" on the y-axis. A legend\
    \ in the lower-left corner titled \"Annual Passengers\" shows three line thicknesses\
    \ representing 350k, 600k, and 850k passengers. The plot has a subtle dashed grid\
    \ with appropriate transparency."
