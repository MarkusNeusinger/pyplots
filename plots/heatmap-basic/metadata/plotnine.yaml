review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme using Python brand colors (blue/yellow) that
    is colorblind-safe
  - Clear value annotations in each cell make exact values easy to read
  - Well-structured data with meaningful trend pattern showing performance improvement
    over time
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_tile + geom_text)
  - Correct categorical ordering preserves temporal sequence on x-axis and intuitive
    top-to-bottom region ordering
  - Title follows exact specification format
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or additional context (e.g., Value could specify Performance
    Index or similar)
  - Cell annotation text color is always black, which reduces contrast on darker blue
    cells (e.g., Region G, Q1 2023 at -45.4)
