review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clear proportional arc heights showing connection
    distances
  - Smart use of semi-transparency (alpha=0.6) for overlapping arcs
  - Weight-based line thickness provides additional dimension
  - Clean minimalist styling with hidden axes appropriate for arc diagrams
  - Realistic character interaction scenario matches spec applications
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability at high resolution
  - Does not leverage lets-plot specific interactive features (could use tooltips
    on hover)
  image_description: The plot displays a well-executed arc diagram visualizing character
    interactions. Ten nodes (Alice, Bob, Carol, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry, Iris,
    Jack) are arranged horizontally along a baseline, represented as yellow circular
    markers. Blue semi-transparent arcs curve above the baseline connecting related
    characters. Arc heights are proportional to the distance between connected nodes
    - short-range connections (like Alice-Bob) have low arcs while long-range connections
    (like Alice-Jack) have tall arcs spanning nearly the full width. Arc thickness
    varies based on connection weight, with stronger connections appearing thicker.
    The title "Character Interactions · arc-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left in bold. Node labels are displayed below each node in bold blue
    text. The design uses a clean white background with no axis lines or grid.

        comment: Title and labels are clearly readable. Font sizes are appropriate
          for the output resolution. Labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability.

        comment: No overlapping text elements. Node labels are well-spaced and arcs
          do not obscure labels.

        passed: true
        comment: Nodes are clearly visible with good sizing. Arcs use appropriate
          alpha (0.6) for overlapping connections. Some thinner arcs could be slightly
          more visible.

        comment: N/A for arc diagrams (axes are hidden by design), but no descriptive

        comment: Appropriately no grid for this diagram type. Legend hidden as connection
          weights are shown via line thickness.

        comment: Shows both short-range and long-range connections, varying weights

          spec (10-50 nodes typical).

        comment: Uses ggplot2 grammar correctly with geom_path, geom_point, geom_text,
          and scale_size_identity. However, does not leverage any lets-plot specific
          interactive features or advanced capabilities beyond basic ggplot2 syntax.
