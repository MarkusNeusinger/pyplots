review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Andrews curves Fourier transformation with correct
    formula
  - Perfect use of StandardScaler for data normalization as specified
  - Clear visual separation of setosa species from versicolor/virginica clusters
  - Proper alpha transparency (0.4) for 150 overlapping curves revealing density patterns
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar with appropriate geom_line grouping by observation
  - Professional text sizing and theme configuration for high-resolution output
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette could be more distinct - the green and blue can appear similar in
    dense curve regions; consider using a more divergent palette
