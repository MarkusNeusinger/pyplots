review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Kaplan-Meier step functions using ax.step with correct
    post interpolation
  - 'Complete spec compliance: CI bands, censored tick marks, median annotations,
    group comparison all included'
  - Clean, well-commented code following KISS principles with proper Greenwald variance
    calculation
  - Good color choices (blue/yellow) that are colorblind-accessible and high contrast
  - Proper handling of censored observations with interpolated survival values for
    tick mark placement
  weaknesses:
  - Missing at-risk table below the plot which was suggested in spec Notes
  - The confidence interval bands could be slightly more transparent to better show
    curve overlap regions
  - Median text box positioning could be adjusted to avoid any potential overlap with
    axis labels
