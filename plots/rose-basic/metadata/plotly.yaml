review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotly's barpolar trace type for creating the rose chart
  - Proper clockwise direction with rotation starting at 12 o'clock position (as spec
    recommends for time data)
  - Beautiful Python-themed color gradient (yellow to blue) that is colorblind-accessible
  - White borders between segments enhance visual distinction
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output, leveraging plotly's interactivity
  - Custom hover template with mm units provides useful tooltip information
  - Radial axis tick suffix mm makes values self-documenting
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis label text is angled and slightly harder to read than if horizontal
  - Data range is somewhat narrow (35-85mm); more extreme variation would better showcase
    the plot type
  - Could add a subtitle or annotation explaining the data context
