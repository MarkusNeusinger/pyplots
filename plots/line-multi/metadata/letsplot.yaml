review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with explicit font sizes for all elements (28pt title, 22pt
    axis titles, 18pt axis/legend text)
  - Clean data generation creating distinct trend patterns (growth, seasonal, gradual)
    that demonstrate the multi-line comparison effectively
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar with long-format data and aes mappings
  - Good marker visibility with size=5 and alpha=0.9 on points
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs showcasing lets-plot dual static/interactive
    capability
  - Professional title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette (blue/yellow/red) while distinguishable could be more colorblind-safe;
    consider using scale_color_brewer or viridis
  - Legend title Product is generic; could be more contextual like Product Line
  - Could add tooltips for the HTML version to enhance interactivity
