review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative grammar with separate scales for color, stroke
    dash, and stroke width
  - Clean data reshaping from wide to long format for proper Altair encoding
  - Thoughtful styling with distinct line patterns making series distinguishable even
    in grayscale
  - Proper handling of temporal data with formatted date axis
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional value for HTML export
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-right overlaps the data area where high prices are displayed
  - Could add .interactive() to enable zoom/pan functionality
  - SMA 200 line is quite short (only ~100 days visible) due to late start
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series chart for the Simple Moving
    Average (SMA) indicator. The close price is shown as a solid blue line (#306998)
    exhibiting typical stock price volatility, ranging from approximately $88 to $126
    over the period from January 2025 to October 2025. Three SMA overlays are rendered
    with distinct dashed line styles: SMA 20 in yellow (#FFD43B) with long dashes,
    SMA 50 in red (#E74C3C) with short dashes, and SMA 200 in green (#2ECC71) with
    dotted pattern. The title "indicator-sma · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered
    at the top. A legend labeled "Series" is positioned in the top-right corner showing
    all four data series. The x-axis displays dates with month-year format at a 45-degree
    angle, and the y-axis shows "Price ($)" with values from 86 to 130. The chart
    effectively demonstrates how longer-period SMAs start later (SMA 200 only begins
    in late July) and provide smoother trend lines.'

        comment: Uses Altair encoding with color/strokeDash/strokeWidth scales and
          tooltips, but could leverage more distinctive features like .interactive()
