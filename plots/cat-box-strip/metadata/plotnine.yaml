review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent ggplot2 grammar of graphics implementation with clean layer composition
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.7 for boxes, 0.6 for jitter points) to show
    overlay clearly
  - Well-designed data showcasing different distribution characteristics (tight vs
    wide spread, outliers, bimodal)
  - Proper figure sizing (16, 9) and font sizes following library guidelines
  - Color palette is visually appealing and accessible
  weaknesses:
  - Grid is barely visible (nearly invisible), could use slightly higher alpha for
    better reference
