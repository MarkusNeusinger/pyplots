review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of all four standard line styles (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
    as specified
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper ggplot2-style layered
    construction
  - Good color palette with distinct colors for each product line
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Well-structured data preparation in long format for plotnine
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too faint (alpha=0.3 and 0.2) - should be more visible for readability
  - Yellow line (Product B) has reduced contrast against the light background
  - X-axis shows decimal quarters (2.5, 5.0, etc.) rather than meaningful labels like
    Q1 2022
  image_description: 'The plot shows a styled line chart with four product lines (A,
    B, C, D) displaying quarterly sales data over 12 quarters. The title reads "line-styled
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" at the top. The y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands USD)"
    and ranges from approximately 80 to 150. The x-axis shows "Quarter" from 1 to
    12.5. Each product line uses a distinct line style: Product A (solid dark blue),
    Product B (dashed yellow/gold), Product C (dotted green), and Product D (dash-dot
    pink). The legend is positioned on the right side with clear labels. The plot
    uses a minimal theme with subtle gray grid lines.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar correctly with scale_linetype_manual and scale_color_manual,
          but doesn't leverage any unique plotnine features beyond basic grammar of
          graphics
  verdict: APPROVED
