review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of frequency spectrum with clear identification of fundamental
    (440 Hz) and harmonic peaks (880, 1320 Hz)
  - Proper use of AreaSplineSeries with gradient fill for aesthetic appeal
  - Correct dB scale for amplitude representation as recommended in spec
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme (#306998 blue)
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) provides both static and interactive versions
  - Comprehensive subtitle explaining the signal composition
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis tick labels are dense with many values displayed; could use larger tick
    intervals for cleaner appearance
  - Legend font size could be larger relative to other text elements
