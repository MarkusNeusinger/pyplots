review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of expanding forecast uncertainty with nested confidence
    bands
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper data separation
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layer composition
  - Realistic electricity demand scenario with clear seasonal patterns
  - Proper use of color coding to distinguish historical vs forecast data
  - Text sizing optimized for 4800x2700 output resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Legend does not include entries for 80% and 95% confidence intervals (spec requires
    this)
  - Yellow confidence bands could be more colorblind-friendly (consider blue tones
    matching historical line)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series of electricity demand spanning
    from January 2022 to January 2026. The historical period (Jan 2022 - Dec 2024)
    is shown with a solid blue line (#306998), exhibiting clear seasonal oscillation
    with peaks around 125-140 GWh and troughs around 90-110 GWh. A vertical dashed
    gray line marks the forecast boundary at January 2025. The forecast period (Jan
    2025 - Dec 2025) uses a dashed orange/brown line (#B85C00) with two nested yellow
    confidence bands: a darker inner band (80% CI, alpha 0.5) and a lighter outer
    band (95% CI, alpha 0.3). The uncertainty bands widen progressively over time,
    correctly showing increasing forecast uncertainty. The title "timeseries-forecast-uncertainty
    · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is at the top in large text. A legend at the top center
    distinguishes "Historical" and "Forecast" series. X-axis labels are rotated 45
    degrees showing "Jan 2022", "Jul 2022", etc. Y-axis is labeled "Electricity Demand
    (GWh)" with units. The plot uses a minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.'
