review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimalist aesthetic that exemplifies the lollipop chart concept
  - Excellent color scheme with Python-themed blue/yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Data properly sorted by value descending for optimal readability
  - Text sizing perfectly calibrated for 4800x2700 output
  - Good use of rotated labels to prevent overlap with 10 categories
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed set (though data is deterministic)
  - Grid styling could include minor gridlines for enhanced readability
  image_description: The plot displays a lollipop chart showing product sales by category.
    Ten categories are shown on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden,
    Sports, Books, Toys, Beauty, Automotive, Food & Beverages, Office Supplies), sorted
    in descending order by value. Blue vertical stems (#306998) extend from y=0 to
    each data point, topped with yellow circular markers (#FFD43B) featuring blue
    borders. Y-axis shows "Sales (thousands)" ranging from 0 to approximately 95.
    X-axis labels are rotated 45 degrees for readability. The title "lollipop-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A subtle dashed horizontal grid
    (alpha=0.3) aids value reading. The layout is clean with good use of canvas space.
