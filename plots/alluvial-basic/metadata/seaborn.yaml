review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent choice of realistic election data that perfectly matches the spec suggested
    application
  - Clean visual design with appropriate transparency on flow bands for overlapping
    flows
  - Colorblind-safe palette with clearly distinguishable colors
  - Well-balanced layout filling the canvas appropriately
  - Labels on both sides provide easy reading of start/end values
  - Year totals provide helpful context
  - Smooth Bezier curves for flow bands look professional
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra context prefix instead of strictly following {spec-id}
    · {library} · pyplots.ai format
  - Limited use of native seaborn plotting functions (only styling via set_style/set_context),
    as seaborn lacks native alluvial support
  - Some smaller flow bands are difficult to track visually across the diagram
  - Code could be simplified; the flow drawing logic is complex
