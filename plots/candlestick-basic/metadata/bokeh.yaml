review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized candles and wicks for the data density
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with appropriate volatility modeling
  - Clean separation of bullish/bearish data sources for proper rendering
  - Proper use of Bokeh segment glyph for wicks and vbar for candle bodies
  - Correct 4800x2700 resolution with appropriately scaled text sizes
  - Subtle grid styling that aids readability without distraction
  weaknesses:
  - Green/red color scheme is not optimal for colorblind accessibility - consider
    blue/orange alternative
  - HTML output does not include hover tooltips to show OHLC values - missed opportunity
    for Bokeh interactivity
