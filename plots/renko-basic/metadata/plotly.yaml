review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with proper font sizes and clean layout
  - Good use of Plotly interactivity with detailed hover tooltips showing brick number,
    open/close prices, and type
  - Correct Renko algorithm implementation with proper brick direction handling
  - Helpful annotation showing the brick size parameter
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Uses a function (calculate_renko()) instead of inline code, violating KISS principle
  - Green/red color scheme, while traditional for finance, is not optimal for colorblind
    accessibility
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 75 bricks
    showing price movement from around $100 to a low of ~$80 and back up to ~$100.
    Green bricks represent bullish (upward) price movements and red bricks represent
    bearish (downward) movements. The chart has a clean white background with a subtle
    gray grid. The title "renko-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    in large font. A horizontal legend shows "Bullish (Up)" and "Bearish (Down)" below
    the title. The X-axis is labeled "Brick Index" (0-70), and the Y-axis shows "Price
    (USD)" with dollar formatting ($80-$105). An annotation in the bottom-right corner
    displays "Brick Size: $2.00". The bricks are uniform in height, with clear separation
    between them, and the color contrast between green (#2ECC71) and red (#E74C3C)
    is good.'
