review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of overfitting pattern with training loss continuing to
    decrease while validation loss increases after epoch ~25
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - 'Appropriate use of Python brand colors (blue #306998, yellow #FFD43B) for visual
    distinction'
  - Good font sizing and spacing for 4800x2700 canvas with customized Style
  - Y-axis label specifies Cross-Entropy Loss as recommended in specification
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned outside plot area in top-left corner appears slightly disconnected
    from the chart
  - 'Optional feature from spec not implemented: marking the epoch with minimum validation
    loss (optimal stopping point)'
  - Grid only shows horizontal lines; vertical guides disabled which reduces readability
    for epoch identification
