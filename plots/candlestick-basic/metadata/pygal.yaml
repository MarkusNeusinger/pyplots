review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of candlesticks using XY chart with varying stroke widths
    for bodies vs wicks
  - Proper color coding with appropriate green/red palette for bullish/bearish candles
  - Well-sized fonts and elements for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Good use of pygal Style class for consistent theming
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with proper price continuity
  - Legend correctly identifies only one entry per category
  weaknesses:
  - Wicks could be slightly thicker for better visibility at smaller display sizes
  - Bottom legend creates extra whitespace below the chart
  image_description: The plot displays a candlestick chart showing 30 trading days
    of stock price data. Green candlesticks indicate bullish (up) days where close
    > open, while red/coral candlesticks indicate bearish (down) days. Each candlestick
    has a body showing the open-close range and wicks (thin lines) extending to show
    the high-low range. The price axis ranges from approximately 128 to 172 dollars,
    showing a general downward trend over the period. The title "candlestick-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top, with "Trading Day" on the x-axis and
    "Price ($)" on the y-axis. A legend at the bottom identifies "Bullish (Up)" in
    green and "Bearish (Down)" in red.
