review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent size legend implementation with proxy bubbles showing three reference
    sizes
  - Proper area-based scaling for bubble sizes (meeting spec requirement)
  - Good transparency (alpha=0.6) for handling overlapping bubbles as spec recommends
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper DataFrame usage
  - Title format exactly matches required format with middle dots
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Value, Y Value) rather than having real-world context
    with units
  - Could leverage seaborn hue parameter to add color as optional fourth dimension
    per spec suggestion
  - Data context is synthetic without a compelling real-world scenario
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bubble chart with 50 semi-transparent blue
    bubbles (#306998) on a white background with subtle dashed grid lines. The bubbles
    vary in size from small (Size: 20) to large (Size: 80), representing a third variable.
    The X-axis is labeled "X Value" and ranges from approximately 20 to 80, while
    the Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" and ranges from approximately 15 to 70. The data
    shows a clear positive correlation between X and Y values. A size legend titled
    "Bubble Size" appears in the upper-left corner with three reference bubbles (20,
    50, 80). The title "bubble-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top
    in the correct format.'

          but doesn't leverage seaborn's advanced features like hue/style or statistical
          annotations
  verdict: APPROVED
