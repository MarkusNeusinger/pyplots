review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curve with all required spec features
    (diagonal reference, binning, Brier score, histogram)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good use of Altair layering and vconcat for combining charts
  - Appropriate color scheme with good contrast between calibration line (blue) and
    reference line (yellow dashed)
  - Subtitle elegantly displays the Brier score metric
  - Tooltips included on data points for interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing subtle grid lines which would aid in reading exact values from the calibration
    curve
  - Histogram bars could use slight spacing/gap for better visual separation
