review:
  strengths:
  - Well-chosen technology innovation data with realistic, current names and plausible
    ring assignments
  - Clean 270-degree layout leaving room for the legend, matching the spec suggestion
  - Subtle ring background fills with distinct pastel colors add visual hierarchy
    to time horizons
  - Sector headers in bold, color-matched text are immediately readable
  - Ring labels with rounded white background boxes avoid visual clutter
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn library is barely used — only styling functions (set_style, set_context),
    no seaborn plotting functions like sns.scatterplot. This is essentially a matplotlib
    implementation with a seaborn import
  - 'Multiple label overlaps: Confidential Compute / Green Software, RAG Pipelines
    / AI Code Review, and other crowded areas reduce readability'
  - No marker shape variation per sector — spec suggests distinct marker shapes for
    visual grouping
  - No visual hierarchy or emphasis in data storytelling — all items appear equally
    important with same size dots
  - Legend only shows sector colors, missing ring/time-horizon legend that would help
    interpretation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a radar/polar chart using a 270-degree layout
    with four concentric rings (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold from inner to outer) and
    four angular sectors (Sustainability, Cloud & Infra, AI & ML, Biotech). Each sector
    is color-coded: green for Sustainability, orange for Cloud & Infra, blue for AI
    & ML, and purple for Biotech. Innovation items (27 total) are plotted as colored
    dots with text labels. Ring boundaries are drawn as gray circles with subtle colored
    background fills (greenish for Adopt, pale orange for Trial, pale yellow for Assess,
    pale pink for Hold). Sector divider lines separate the wedges. Sector headers
    appear in bold colored text along the outer edge. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess,
    Hold) appear in boxed text along a radial axis. The title reads "radar-innovation-timeline
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend box in the lower-right corner maps
    colors to sector names. Overall the chart reads well but has several label overlaps
    — notably "Confidential Compute" and "Green Software" crowd each other, and "RAG
    Pipelines"/"AI Code Review" labels are very close together.'
