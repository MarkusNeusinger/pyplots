review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar bar visualization using Altair mark_arc with theta/theta2/radius
    encoding
  - Clean visual design with white stroke separating bars and well-positioned direction
    labels
  - Realistic wind frequency data showing prevailing westerly pattern
  - Good use of sequential blue color scheme for frequency encoding
  - Proper KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Legend lacks units for frequency (e.g., Frequency (days) or Frequency (%))
  - Interactive features (tooltips) defined but chart not made interactive with .interactive()
  - Some canvas space wasted on the right side near legend area
