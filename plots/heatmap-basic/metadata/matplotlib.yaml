review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of adaptive text colors (white on dark, black on light) for cell
    annotations ensuring readability
  - 'Perfect implementation of spec requirements: diverging colormap (RdBu_r), cell
    annotations, and colorbar'
  - Clean, symmetric correlation matrix with realistic department names providing
    meaningful context
  - Square aspect ratio (12×12) ideal for matrix visualization
  - Well-sized fonts throughout (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks, 14pt annotations)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use matplotlib-specific features like ax.matshow() instead of ax.imshow()
    for more idiomatic matrix display
  - Department axis labels could include additional context (e.g., "Department" →
    "Department Correlation")
