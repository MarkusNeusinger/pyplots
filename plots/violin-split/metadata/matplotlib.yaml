review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent split violin implementation using path clipping technique (manual vertex
    manipulation)
  - Realistic salary data scenario with meaningful department/gender comparison
  - Clear visual distinction between Male (blue) and Female (yellow) with accessible
    colors
  - Properly formatted quartile markers with high-contrast white+dark edge design
  - Clean KISS code structure with no functions/classes
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could more explicitly indicate that Male is left half and Female is right
    half within each violin
  - 'Implementation header still shows Quality: pending instead of actual score (minor
    metadata issue)'
