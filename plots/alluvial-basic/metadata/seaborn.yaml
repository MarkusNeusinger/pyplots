review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe color palette with distinct, meaningful colors for each
    party
  - Clean implementation of alluvial diagram using Bezier curves for smooth flow bands
  - Appropriate use of transparency (alpha=0.35) for overlapping flows as specified
  - Realistic, comprehensible voter migration scenario with actual election years
  - Well-organized data structure with clear flow transition matrices
  - Proper seaborn styling applied (whitegrid, talk context)
  - Good legend placement and subtitle explanation
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra content beyond required spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
    format
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features - mostly matplotlib drawing with seaborn
    styling only
  - Party labels on left side only - could be mirrored on right for balance
  - Some flow data inconsistencies (e.g., 2016->2020 Other flows sum to 26.9 but Other
    only had 4.5M voters in 2016)
