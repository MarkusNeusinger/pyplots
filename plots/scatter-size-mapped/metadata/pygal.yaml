review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data generation with regional economic patterns (Europe higher
    GDP, Africa lower GDP)
  - Proper use of pygal XY chart with custom node sizes via the node dict parameter
    for bubble sizing
  - Well-implemented semi-transparency (opacity=0.6) for distinguishing overlapping
    bubbles
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Size legend integrated into title subtitle (Bubble Size = Population 1M to 1B+)
  - Improved minimum bubble size (12) from previous attempt makes smaller populations
    more visible
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are too subtle and barely visible - could use more prominent guide
    styling
  - Title format includes subtitle which slightly deviates from the exact spec format
