review:
  strengths:
  - Clean manual positioning algorithm that prevents word overlap while maintaining
    cloud-like appearance
  - Excellent color palette using Python branding colors (blues, yellows, grays)
  - Proper use of Plotly hover functionality showing word and frequency on hover
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Well-structured code with clear comments explaining each section
  - Good font size scaling that creates clear visual hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates or annotations
  - Color palette has multiple similar blue shades that could be more distinctive
