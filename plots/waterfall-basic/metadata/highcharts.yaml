review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue for totals, orange for decreases,
    teal for increases)
  - Clean waterfall visualization with proper connecting lines between bars
  - Data labels show +/- prefixes for clarity on direction of change
  - Realistic financial scenario that demonstrates the waterfall concept well
  - Proper use of Highcharts isSum property for the final total bar
  - Title follows the required pyplots.ai format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are very subtle and could be more visible for easier value reading
  - Data labels on smaller bars appear somewhat cramped
  - X-axis Category label is not particularly informative for this financial context
  image_description: 'The plot displays a waterfall chart showing a quarterly financial
    breakdown. The chart starts with a tall blue "Revenue" bar at $500,000, followed
    by orange bars representing decreases: Product Costs (-$150,000), Operating Expenses
    (-$80,000), Marketing (-$45,000), R&D (-$35,000), and Taxes (-$52,000). There
    is one teal/cyan bar for "Other Income" (+$20,000) representing an increase. The
    final blue bar shows "Net Income" at $158,000. Connecting dotted lines link the
    bars to show cumulative flow. Data labels appear on each bar showing the change
    amount with +/- prefixes. The y-axis shows "Amount ($)" with values from $0 to
    $540,000. X-axis labels are rotated at -45 degrees. The title follows the required
    format. Colors are colorblind-safe (blue for totals, orange for decreases, teal
    for increases).'

        comment: Uses Highcharts native waterfall type with isSum/isIntermediateSum,
          custom formatters for data labels, but could leverage more Highcharts-specific
          features like animations or drill-down
  verdict: APPROVED
