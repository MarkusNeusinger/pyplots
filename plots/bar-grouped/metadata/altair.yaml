review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative xOffset encoding for creating grouped bars
    without manual position calculation
  - Clean readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between product lines
  - Appropriate font sizes ensure readability at target resolution
  - Tooltips enhance the interactive HTML version
  - Realistic business scenario with meaningful quarterly revenue data showing clear
    trends
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-right overlaps slightly with the plot area; consider orient
    right outside the plot
