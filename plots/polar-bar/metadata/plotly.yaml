review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the wind rose concept with stacked bars showing multiple
    wind speed categories
  - Clean, professional appearance with well-chosen colors and layout
  - All 16 compass directions labeled clearly without overlap
  - Good use of Plotly's Barpolar trace type for native polar bar chart support
  - Proper title format following the pyplots.ai standard
  weaknesses:
  - Radial axis label says Frequency (%) but data appears to be raw counts, not percentages
  - Two similar blue tones (dark blue and light blue) could be more differentiated
    for better accessibility
  - Legend border could be more subtle (lower alpha or thinner)
