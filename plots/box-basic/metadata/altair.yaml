review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with proper encoding types (N for nominal,
    Q for quantitative)
  - 'Well-customized box plot with styled median line (white, strokeWidth: 3) and
    outlier sizing'
  - 'Good color palette using Python colors (#306998, #FFD43B) plus colorblind-safe
    additions'
  - Proper currency formatting on y-axis using format specification
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Does not include tooltips which are a key Altair feature for data exploration
  - Legend is explicitly hidden (legend=None) when it could aid readability
  - Grid opacity configured but not showing strongly in the visualization
