review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent beeswarm algorithm implementation that properly spreads points horizontally
    to avoid overlap
  - Good use of pygal XY chart to simulate swarm plot behavior
  - Clear distinction between categories with appropriate colors
  - Mean markers added for each category as suggested in spec
  - Realistic employee performance data scenario with appropriate score ranges
  - 'Title follows correct format: swarm-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows duplicate entries for categories and Mean - could be cleaner
  - Y-axis range extends to 120 but no data points above ~115, slight wasted space
    at top
