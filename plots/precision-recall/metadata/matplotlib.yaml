review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stepped line style for precision-recall curve using
    ax.step()
  - 'Complete feature coverage: AP score, baseline reference line, iso-F1 curves all
    present'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Professional visualization with appropriate colors and styling
  - Realistic imbalanced dataset simulation (20/80 split)
  - Good use of beta distributions to simulate realistic classifier scores
  weaknesses:
  - F1 curve labels are relatively small (fontsize=12) and low contrast (gray, alpha=0.7)
    - could be more prominent
  - Only shows single classifier; spec mentions multiple classifiers comparison as
    an option
  - Header claims matplotlib 3.10.0 but version is hardcoded without verification
  image_description: The plot displays a Precision-Recall curve on a 16:9 aspect ratio
    canvas. The main curve is rendered as a stepped line in blue (#306998) showing
    classifier performance, with a light blue semi-transparent fill beneath it. The
    curve starts at precision=1.0, recall=0.0 and descends as recall increases, ending
    around precision=0.4 at recall=1.0. A yellow dashed horizontal line at precision=0.2
    indicates the random baseline (positive class ratio of 20%). Four gray dotted
    iso-F1 curves (F1=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) are overlaid as reference contours with
    labels on the right edge. The legend in the upper right shows "Classifier (AP
    = 0.920)" and "Random Baseline (P = 20%)". Title reads "precision-recall · matplotlib
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. Axes are labeled "Recall" (x-axis) and "Precision" (y-axis).
    A subtle gray dashed grid provides reference.

          the explicit library version "3.10.0" in header may not match actual version'

        comment: Uses ax.step, fill_between, annotate - good matplotlib features but
          nothing particularly distinctive
  verdict: APPROVED
