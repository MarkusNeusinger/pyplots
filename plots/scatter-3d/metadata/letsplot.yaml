review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach to simulate 3D visualization using isometric projection with
    lets-plot
  - Good use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Painters algorithm (back-to-front rendering via depth sorting) effectively creates
    depth perception
  - Perspective effect through variable point sizes adds to 3D illusion
  - Gray axis lines help orient the viewer in the projected 3D space
  - Interactive tooltips showing Z value and depth enhance exploration
  - Proper use of scale_size_identity for custom point sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Contains a helper function (project_point) violating KISS structure
  - Axis labels are technical (X-Y Projection, Z Projection) rather than descriptive
    of actual data
  - The 3D projection is static in PNG output - no true interactive rotation capability
  - Legend label Z Value is generic rather than contextual
  - The three clusters have similar spreads/shapes - more varied cluster characteristics
    would demonstrate the plot type better
