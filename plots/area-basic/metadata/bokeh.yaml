review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic website traffic data with believable weekly patterns and upward trend
  - Proper use of Bokeh varea() for area fill with line overlay for definition
  - Semi-transparent fill (0.4) matches spec recommendation (0.3-0.5)
  - Y-axis correctly starts at 0 for honest area representation
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity - Bokeh key strength is interactive exploration
  - Axis labels lack units (could be Daily Visitors count or similar)
  - Large empty space below data since values range 4000-7000 but y starts at 0
