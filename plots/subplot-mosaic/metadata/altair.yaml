review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of mosaic layout concept using Altair concatenation operators
    (hconcat, vconcat)
  - Clean, professional visual design with consistent color scheme (#306998 blue theme)
  - Good variety of chart types (line, bar, scatter, area, gauge) showing layout flexibility
  - Descriptive axis labels with appropriate units throughout
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with plausible data
  weaknesses:
  - No demonstration of empty cells using placeholder characters (e.g., "." for gaps)
    as mentioned in spec
  - Scatter plot lacks legend for the color encoding (efficiency gradient)
  - HTML version could benefit from interactive features (tooltips, selection) which
    Altair excels at
