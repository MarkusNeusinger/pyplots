review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS flat structure without functions or classes (addressed previous feedback)
  - Excellent custom implementation using geom_polygon for smooth curved ribbons with
    easing
  - Professional color scheme that is colorblind-accessible
  - Realistic e-commerce customer journey scenario with meaningful category names
  - Labels include counts for quantitative context
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - No text overlap with alternating label positions
  weaknesses:
  - Category label text could be slightly larger (size 14 → 16) for optimal readability
