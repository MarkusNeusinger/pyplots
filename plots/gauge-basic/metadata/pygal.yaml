review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal SolidGauge with half_pie=True for semi-circular display
  - Clean color zone logic that changes gauge color based on value thresholds
  - Professional custom styling with appropriate font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Good use of value_formatter for percentage display
  - Realistic sales performance context that matches spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - The threshold zones (red/yellow/green) are not visually displayed on the gauge
    - only the current zone color shows
  - Title format includes extra text (Sales Performance) before the required format
  - Legend is positioned far from the gauge in the bottom-left corner
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular (half-pie) solid gauge chart
    with a green (#2ECC71) filled arc representing 72% progress. The gauge has an
    inner radius creating a donut-style appearance. The value "72%" is displayed twice
    - once inside the colored arc and once at the bottom right of the gauge in the
    unfilled (light gray) section. The title "Sales Performance · gauge-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in dark text. A legend at the bottom left shows
    "Current Sales: 72% (Good Zone)" with a small green marker. The background is
    white, and the overall layout is clean with the gauge centered in the canvas.'
