review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of dashboard-style grid using Altair's native vconcat/hconcat
    composition
  - Strong visual hierarchy with main chart appropriately larger than detail panels
  - Good use of consistent color scheme (Python blue/gold theme)
  - Comprehensive financial dashboard scenario with meaningful interconnected data
  - Clean declarative code structure showcasing Altair's strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Legend for category breakdown appears isolated from the donut chart (top-right
    instead of near the chart)
  - Could demonstrate rowspan capability (e.g., a tall sidebar chart) in addition
    to colspan
  - Tick labels on x-axis of main chart are dense and could benefit from rotation
    or fewer ticks
