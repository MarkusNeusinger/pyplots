review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent polar coordinate implementation using manual Cartesian transformation
    when native coord_polar is unavailable
  - Clean visual design with appropriate colors, grid lines, and month labels
  - Good use of multiple series to demonstrate comparison capability
  - Realistic temperature data with clear seasonal patterns
  - Proper closed-loop polar lines connecting first and last points
  - Well-balanced layout with legend positioned cleanly
  weaknesses:
  - Missing temperature scale labels (no indication of what the concentric circles
    represent in °C)
  - 'Minor: LetsPlot.setup_html() call is unnecessary for PNG-only output'
