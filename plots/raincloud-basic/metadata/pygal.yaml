review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround using pygal XY chart to construct raincloud plot component
    by component
  - Proper KDE implementation with Silverman rule bandwidth selection
  - Complete box plot construction with median, quartiles, whiskers and caps
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/green)
  - Realistic clinical trial scenario with plausible reaction time data
  - Good code organization with pre-computation of all components
  weaknesses:
  - 'Raincloud layout violates the core visual metaphor: rain should appear BELOW
    the cloud (vertically), not horizontally offset to the left'
  - Legend is redundant with x-axis labels and should be removed
  - Box plot line weights are too thin for the 4800x2700 canvas
