review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of calibration curve concept with comparison of two models
    (calibrated vs overconfident)
  - Perfect compliance with specification including optional histogram subplot for
    prediction distribution
  - Brier scores displayed in legend provide quantitative calibration metrics
  - Clean, professional visual design with appropriate color choices
  - Proper use of plotly subplots with appropriate row height ratios
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram subplot could benefit from more visible distinction between overlapping
    distributions (consider side-by-side instead of overlay)
  - Does not leverage plotly interactive hover features to show bin details on mouseover
