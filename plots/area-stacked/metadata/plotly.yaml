  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stacked area chart with proper use of plotly stackgroup
    parameter
  - Very readable text with well-chosen font sizes for high-resolution output
  - Realistic website traffic data with meaningful upward trends over time
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility
  - Good use of semi-transparent fills (0.7 alpha) for visual distinction between
    layers
  - Proper title format and well-positioned horizontal legend
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette includes pink and green together which may be challenging for colorblind
    users
  - All four series trend upward - showing at least one declining series would better
    demonstrate compositional changes
  - Axis labels lack units
  - Could leverage more plotly-specific features like custom hover templates
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked area chart showing website traffic
    sources over 24 months (Jan 2023 to Dec 2024). Four distinct traffic sources are
    stacked: Organic Search (blue, at the bottom), Direct (yellow), Social Media (green),
    and Referral (pink, at the top). The y-axis shows "Monthly Visitors" ranging from
    0 to approximately 85,000 using "k" notation. The x-axis shows "Month" with quarterly
    date labels. The title reads "Website Traffic Sources · area-stacked · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" with a horizontal legend placed above the chart. All four series
    show upward trends over time, with Organic Search being the largest contributor.
    The chart uses semi-transparent fills with subtle grid lines on a white background.'
