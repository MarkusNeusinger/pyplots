review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual polar coordinate transformation since Bokeh lacks native polar
    support
  - Clean implementation of concentric radial gridlines and angular spokes
  - Perfect time-based data orientation with midnight at top
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  - Appropriate sizing and alpha values for visibility
  - Outputs both PNG and interactive HTML
  weaknesses:
  - Missing radial axis labels to show temperature scale/units
  - Could leverage HoverTool to display hour and temperature on hover for interactivity
  - Title font size could be slightly larger for 3600x3600 canvas
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a polar chart showing hourly temperature data over a 24-hour cycle. It uses a circular layout with the center representing the origin. The chart has:
    - **Title**: "polar-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top in gray text
    - **Angular labels**: 8 time labels at 3-hour intervals (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00) in gray text around the perimeter
    - **Radial gridlines**: 4 concentric circles in light gray with low alpha
    - **Angular gridlines**: 8 spokes extending from center to edge in light gray
    - **Data representation**: Blue (#306998) scatter points connected by blue lines forming a closed polygon
    - **Pattern**: The data shows temperatures peaking around 12:00-15:00 (afternoon, maximum radius at bottom) and lowest around 00:00-06:00 (early morning, minimum radius at top)
    - **Background**: Light off-white (#fafafa)
    - **Layout**: Square aspect ratio, plot well-centered with balanced margins

        comment: Correctly uses ColumnDataSource and manual polar grid construction,
          but doesn't leverage Bokeh's interactive features like HoverTool which would
          be distinctive
  verdict: APPROVED
