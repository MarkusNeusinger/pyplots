review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance with all requested features including formula legends
    and p=0.5 annotation
  - Strong visual refinement with subtle y-grid, removed toolbar/outline, tinted background,
    and white border fill
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: BoxAnnotation for highlight region,
    HoverTool for interactive HTML, clickable legend with hide policy'
  - Clean, deterministic code with proper edge case handling (np.errstate + nan_to_num
    for log2 at 0)
  - Good color choice with blue/gold palette and dash pattern for secondary differentiation
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout could be tighter: reduce y_range upper bound to minimize unused whitespace
    above the curves'
  - 'Data storytelling could be enhanced: consider adding a subtle annotation or visual
    element that communicates the practical insight (e.g., why both criteria yield
    similar tree structures, or shading the difference area between curves)'
  - The Gini max = 0.5 label position competes slightly with the nearby curve — repositioning
    could improve clarity
  image_description: The plot displays two mathematical curves on a light gray (#f8f8f8)
    background. A solid blue (#306998) line represents Gini impurity (2p(1-p)) and
    a dashed gold (#D4A017) line represents Entropy (-p log2p - (1-p) log2(1-p)).
    Both curves rise from 0 at p=0, peak at p=0.5, and return to 0 at p=1. The entropy
    curve reaches a maximum of 1.0 while the Gini curve peaks at 0.5. Circular markers
    with white borders are placed at both maxima at p=0.5 — a blue dot at y=0.5 and
    a gold dot at y=1.0 — connected by a dotted vertical segment. A bold annotation
    with a white background box reads "p = 0.5 (maximum impurity)" near the top. Italic
    value labels show "Gini max = 0.5" (in blue, left of center) and "Entropy max
    = 1.0" (in dark gold, right of center). A subtle blue-gray BoxAnnotation highlights
    the region from p=0.35 to p=0.65. The legend in the top-left corner displays both
    metric formulas with matching line styles. Title follows the required format "line-impurity-comparison
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai". Only subtle dashed y-axis gridlines are shown. Toolbar
    is removed for clean static output. The white border fill and removed outline
    give a polished look.
