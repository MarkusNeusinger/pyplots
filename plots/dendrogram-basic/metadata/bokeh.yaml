review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of dendrogram structure using Bokeh primitives
    (line glyphs)
  - Two-color scheme effectively distinguishes cluster levels with colorblind-safe
    palette
  - Biologically accurate iris data clustering with proper species separation
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Rotated labels prevent overlap and maintain readability
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Bokeh web capabilities
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label Sample is generic; could be more descriptive like Iris Samples
  - No legend or annotation explaining the blue/yellow color threshold meaning
  - Could use ColumnDataSource for more idiomatic Bokeh code
