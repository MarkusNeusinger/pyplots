review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using XY chart to simulate network graph layout
  - Clean hierarchical tree structure clearly visible
  - Excellent color scheme with distinct colors per hierarchy level
  - Good use of discontinuous line segments (None separators) for edges
  - Deterministic data with realistic organizational structure
  - Proper legend placement at bottom with 5 columns
  weaknesses:
  - Node labels (e.g., VP Eng, Dir FE) are only visible on hover/tooltip, not shown
    directly on the static PNG image
  - Edge lines are thin and could be more visually prominent
  - Bottom 25% of canvas is unused vertical space
  - No direct node labeling visible in static output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical network graph representing
    an organizational chart. At the top (y≈83) is a single dark blue node (CEO). Below
    that (y≈65) are 3 yellow nodes representing VPs (VP Eng, VP Sales, VP Ops). The
    next level (y≈48) shows 7 teal/cyan nodes for Directors. The bottom level (y≈31)
    contains 11 coral/red nodes for Managers. Grey lines connect parent nodes to their
    children, showing the reporting structure. The title "network-hierarchical · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. X-axis is labeled "Organization Width" and Y-axis
    is labeled "Hierarchy Level (Top to Bottom)". A legend at the bottom identifies:
    Edges, CEO, VPs, Directors, and Managers with their respective colors.'
