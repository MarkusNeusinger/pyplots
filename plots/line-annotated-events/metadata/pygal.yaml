review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  - Realistic stock price scenario with quarterly earnings events
  - Correct title format and canvas dimensions (4800x2700)
  - Good color choices - blue line for data, red markers for events
  - Smooth cubic interpolation on the line
  weaknesses:
  - Event text annotations (Q4 Earnings, Q1 Earnings, Launch, Q2 Earnings, Q3 Earnings)
    are not rendered in the PNG output - only red dots appear without labels
  - X-axis month labels are not visible despite code attempting to set them
  - Legend shows generic Key Events instead of individual event names
  - Missing vertical line markers to emphasize event dates as suggested in the specification
