review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of sparkline minimalism with no axes, labels, or gridlines
  - Creative use of separate series for min/max point highlighting with distinct colors
  - Good use of pygal Style class for comprehensive customization
  - Appropriate 4:1 aspect ratio matching spec recommendations
  - Smooth cubic interpolation creates clean visual appearance
  - Fill effect adds visual weight while maintaining minimalism
  weaknesses:
  - Title not visibly rendering in final PNG output despite being configured
  - Margins could be reduced further for tighter sparkline appearance
