review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of KDE for continuous density estimation creating smooth heatmap
    effect
  - Great real-world scenario with California seismic data and appropriate fault-line
    clustering
  - 'Well-layered composition: filled contours + coastline + point markers with size
    encoding'
  - Color scheme effectively communicates density gradient
  - Clean, minimal visual design with proper legends
  weaknesses:
  - Title format starts with description rather than spec-id heatmap-geographic
  - Layout has some unused canvas space on the right side
  - Coastline is simplified; spec suggests more geographic context options
  - Could leverage interactive tooltips for the HTML output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a geographic heatmap of seismic activity density
    across California. The main visualization shows filled contours with a sequential
    color gradient from light yellow (low density, ~0) through orange to dark red
    (high density, ~0.25). Two distinct high-density hotspots are visible: one around
    the San Francisco Bay area (latitude ~37.5-38) and another around Los Angeles
    (latitude ~34). A simplified black coastline outline runs diagonally across the
    plot from northwest to southeast. Individual seismic events are shown as circular
    markers with yellow fill and blue/teal outlines, sized by magnitude (legend shows
    5, 10, 15 scale). The plot has proper axis labels ("Longitude" and "Latitude"),
    a descriptive title following the required format, two legends (Event Density
    colorbar and Magnitude size legend), and uses a minimal gray theme with subtle
    grid lines.'
