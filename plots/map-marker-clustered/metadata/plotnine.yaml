review:
  strengths:
  - Clean hierarchical clustering implementation using scipy ward linkage method
  - Colorblind-friendly color palette for all four categories
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered geoms (geom_point + geom_text)
  - Realistic store locator scenario with actual US West Coast city coordinates
  - Appropriate cluster marker sizing with size legend
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Cluster markers overlap significantly within city regions, making count labels
    hard to read
  - Legend shows confusing duplicate category entries
  - No basemap or geographic context as specified (plotnine limitation)
  - Static plot cannot implement spec core interactive features (zoom, click-to-expand,
    hover)
  - Axis label units are redundant (shows °W but values are negative)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a clustered marker map visualization of the
    US West Coast region (latitude ~32-48°N, longitude ~-123 to -115°W). Markers are
    shown as circles of varying sizes representing cluster counts (5-20+ points),
    colored by dominant category: blue for Retail, yellow/gold for Restaurant, green
    for Service, and gray for Entertainment. The clusters are geographically distributed
    across 5 main city regions (Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San
    Diego). White numeric labels inside each cluster marker indicate the count of
    aggregated points. The plot has a light gray panel background with subtle grid
    lines. Two legends appear on the right side: one for "Category" showing all 4
    category colors, and one for "Points in Cluster" showing size scale (5, 10, 15,
    20). The title follows the correct format: "map-marker-clustered · plotnine ·
    pyplots.ai". Axis labels show "Longitude" and "Latitude".'

        comment: Significant overlap of cluster markers within city regions, especially
          in Seattle/Portland area and Los Angeles/San Diego area. The cluster count
          labels overlap each other making some unreadable.

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with geom_point + geom_text layering, scale_color_manual,
          scale_size_continuous, theme customization, and guides for legend control.
          Good use of plotnine idioms but doesn't showcase unique plotnine capabilities
          beyond what matplotlib could do.
