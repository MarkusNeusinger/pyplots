review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of colorblind-safe palette from seaborn
  - Clear visual hierarchy with party labels on both left and right edges including
    voter counts
  - Smooth curved Bezier flow bands with appropriate transparency
  - Good data narrative showing voter migration patterns across election cycles
  - Adaptive alpha for smaller flows improves visibility
  - Clean white background and proper title format
  weaknesses:
  - No formal legend box (inline labels work but a legend would be cleaner)
  - Limited use of seaborn core plotting functions since alluvial diagrams require
    custom matplotlib patches
