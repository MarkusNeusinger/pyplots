  - Excellent data design with varied distributions showing outliers in Marketing
    and Sales
  - Good color palette with distinct colors for each department
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention

  weaknesses:
  - Outlier points use gray color instead of matching box fill colors, reducing visual
    cohesion
