  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance — all four required features (percentage labels, distinct
    colors, legend, exploded slice) are present
  - Excellent realistic data context with cloud provider market share
  - Clean, idiomatic Plotly code with good use of library-specific features (hovertemplate,
    pull, HTML export)
  - All font sizes explicitly set at appropriate values for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - White slice borders add visual polish and help distinguish adjacent slices
  weaknesses:
  - Small slices (Alibaba 4%, IBM 3%) have cramped labels that create visual crowding
    — consider using textposition=outside for small slices or adjusting label placement
  - Adjacent red (Alibaba) and green (IBM) slices may be problematic for red-green
    colorblind viewers — swap one color
  - Design lacks storytelling annotations (e.g., AWS leads with 31% market share callout,
    or trend indicators)
  - Visual design reads as a well-configured default rather than publication-quality
    — could benefit from a donut hole, subtle shadow, or more sophisticated color
    harmony
  - Wasted whitespace in the lower-right area of the canvas
  image_description: The plot displays a pie chart titled "pie-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    showing cloud provider market share with 6 slices. AWS (31%) is the largest slice
    in dark blue (Python Blue) and is slightly exploded/pulled out for emphasis. Azure
    (24%) is golden yellow, Google Cloud (11%) is teal, Alibaba (4%) is coral/red,
    IBM (3%) is light green, and Others (27%) is light purple. Percentage labels and
    category names appear on each slice. A vertical legend is positioned to the right
    of the pie chart. White border lines (2px) separate adjacent slices. The chart
    uses a clean white background (plotly_white template). The smaller slices (Alibaba
    4%, IBM 3%) have their labels squeezed into narrow areas, creating visual crowding.
