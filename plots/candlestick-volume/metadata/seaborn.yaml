review:
  strengths:
  - Clean dual-pane layout with proper 75/25 height ratio as specified
  - Consistent color scheme (Python Blue/Yellow) applied to both candlesticks and
    volume bars
  - Good use of seaborn styling (whitegrid, talk context) for professional appearance
  - Realistic stock data generation with OHLC relationships and volume correlation
    to price moves
  - Shared x-axis with proper date formatting at regular intervals
  - Well-implemented crosshair with price annotation
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear in front of some chart elements (should use set_axisbelow consistently)
  - Crosshair horizontal line only in price pane, not spanning to volume pane as spec
    suggests
  - Volume bars rendered as grouped/dodged bars (side-by-side blue/yellow pairs) instead
    of single bars per day colored by bullish/bearish
  - Some thin candlestick bodies when open/close are very close together reduce readability
