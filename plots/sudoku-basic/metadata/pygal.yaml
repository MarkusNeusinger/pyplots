review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual execution of Sudoku grid with clear visual hierarchy between
    3x3 boxes and individual cells
  - Perfect text legibility with appropriately sized bold numbers
  - Clean monochrome design ideal for printing as specified
  - Good canvas utilization with well-balanced layout
  - Outputs both SVG and PNG formats leveraging pygal native SVG capabilities
  - Valid, recognizable Sudoku puzzle with varied difficulty regions
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a custom class (SudokuGrid) instead of simple procedural code, violating
    the KISS principle for plot implementations
  - sys.path manipulation is unnecessary complexity that could be avoided
  image_description: The plot displays a 9×9 Sudoku grid with the title "sudoku-basic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The grid features thick black lines separating
    the nine 3×3 box regions, with thinner gray lines dividing individual cells within
    each box. Numbers 1-9 are displayed in a blue color (#306998) in their starting
    positions, centered within their respective cells. Empty cells are left blank.
    The background is white, creating a clean monochrome design. The grid is well-centered
    and fills a good portion of the square canvas. The numbers are bold and clearly
    legible with appropriate font sizing.
