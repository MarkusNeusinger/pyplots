  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance (15/15) with correct title format, all required features,
    and proper data mapping
  - Idiomatic Altair usage with declarative encoding, type annotations, and method
    chaining
  - Excellent code quality with KISS structure, fixed seed, clean imports
  - Realistic educational scenario with appropriate data ranges
  - Tooltips and interactive zoom/pan leverage Altair interactive strengths
  - Font sizes explicitly set for readability at full resolution
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: add a trend line, correlation annotation (r=0.XX), or callout
    for interesting patterns to guide the viewer'
  - Design could be elevated beyond well-configured default — consider background
    color, custom axis formatting, or annotation styling
  - Some wasted canvas space on the left side where data is sparse (1.0-2.0 range
    has only one point)
  - Markers could be slightly smaller to better show individual points in the dense
    center region
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart with steel-blue filled circular
    markers (#306998 Python Blue) with white edge strokes, plotting "Study Hours per
    Day" (x-axis, range ~1.0–8.0) against "Exam Score (%)" (y-axis, range ~40–104).
    The title "scatter-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in
    a large font. A clear positive correlation is visible — students who study more
    hours tend to score higher. Grid lines are present but subtle (low opacity). The
    background is clean white with no view border. Points have moderate transparency
    (opacity 0.7) revealing some overlap in the denser middle region (4–6 hours).
    No legend is shown (single series). The layout uses canvas space reasonably well,
    though there is some empty space on the left side between ~1.0 and ~2.0 hours.
