review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual box plot construction using Bokeh primitives (Whisker, vbar,
    segment)
  - Good use of jitter transform for strip points to reduce overlap
  - Proper colorblind-safe color scheme (blue/yellow contrast)
  - Well-calculated IQR-based whiskers with proper outlier handling
  - Clear demonstration of different distributions and outliers across categories
  - Font sizes properly scaled for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - No legend explaining what box/strip elements represent (minor for this plot type)
  - Could add HoverTool to show exact values on hover for the HTML version
  - The median line segment has zero width (x0=x1) which works but is technically
    a point not a line
