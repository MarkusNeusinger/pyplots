review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent gradient fill implementation that fades from top to bottom, creating
    visual depth
  - Good use of realistic website traffic data with seasonal patterns and growth trend
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  - Markers with white borders add visual polish
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could benefit from units (e.g., Page Views thousands)
  - Legend positioned far from data in top-right corner; could be integrated closer
    to the chart
  image_description: The plot displays a filled line chart (area chart) showing "Monthly
    Website Traffic" over 12 months (Jan-Dec). The chart uses a blue color (#306998)
    with a gradient fill that fades from semi-transparent blue at the top to nearly
    transparent at the bottom. Data points are marked with small circular markers
    with white borders. The line shows seasonal variation with a peak around March-April
    (~72k page views) and a trough around September (~40k). The title "line-filled
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold, with a subtitle "Monthly
    Website Traffic" below it. The Y-axis shows "Page Views" with values from 0 to
    ~77.5k, and the X-axis shows month abbreviations. A legend "Website Traffic" appears
    in the top-right corner.

          doesn't leverage advanced Highcharts features like tooltips configuration
          or animation options
  verdict: APPROVED
