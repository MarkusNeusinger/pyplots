review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible seed
  - Effective alternating blue/gray color scheme for chromosome distinction
  - Correct data generation with realistic chromosome lengths and significant peaks
    on specific chromosomes
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good use of custom Style for font sizes appropriate to 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Missing horizontal threshold lines at -log10(5×10⁻⁸) ≈ 7.3 for genome-wide significance
    and at 5.0 for suggestive threshold (spec requirement)
  - Missing chromosome labels centered below each chromosome region on x-axis (spec
    requirement)
  - Y-axis label encodes threshold values as text rather than showing visual reference
    lines
  - Legend is completely hidden rather than showing chromosome color key
  - No use of pygal distinctive features like tooltips or interactivity
