review:
  strengths:
  - Creative workaround for streamline visualization using XY series with None separators
  - Good color progression from blue (inner) to gold (outer) representing radial distance
  - Proper title format and axis labeling
  - Seed set for reproducibility
  - Clean visual output with balanced layout
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (get_velocity, trace_streamline) instead of flat KISS
    structure
  - Streamlines are connected line segments rather than smooth curves, visible jaggedness
  - Center of vortex shows heavy overlapping of streamlines making it cluttered
  - Legend marker dots are very small compared to the line widths in the plot
