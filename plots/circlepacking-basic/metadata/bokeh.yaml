review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing implementation with proper nesting and non-overlapping
    layout
  - Clean color scheme distinguishing three hierarchy levels (blue root, yellow divisions,
    teal teams)
  - All text labels are well-positioned and readable at full resolution
  - HoverTool provides interactive tooltips with name, level, and budget info
  - Proper Legend explaining the color-by-depth scheme
  - Correct title format and appropriate square canvas size (3600x3600)
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Circle packing algorithm is implemented inline which adds complexity; data size
    is small (14 nodes vs spec suggested 20-200)
  - Slight layout imbalance with empty space at bottom of the canvas
  - HTML output is generated alongside PNG which is acceptable but not strictly required
