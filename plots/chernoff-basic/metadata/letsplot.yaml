review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Chernoff faces using lets-plot grammar of graphics
    approach
  - Clear visual distinction between species through face colors and facial feature
    variations
  - Well-organized 3×4 grid layout with proper spacing
  - Good use of geom_polygon for face outlines and eyes, geom_path for mouth and eyebrows
  - Real Iris dataset provides meaningful multivariate data demonstration
  - Proper normalization of data to 0-1 range as specified
  - 'Facial features effectively encode data: face width (sepal length), eye size
    (sepal width), mouth curvature (petal length), eyebrow slant (petal width)'
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function (create_face) which violates the KISS structure requirement
  - Title uses lets-plot with hyphen instead of letsplot (single word)
  - Legend is somewhat small and isolated on the right side
  - Nose does not vary based on any data variable (static for all faces)
