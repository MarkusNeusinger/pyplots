review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Euler integration to trace streamlines in a declarative
    visualization library
  - Clean viridis color encoding showing velocity magnitude increases with distance
    from center
  - Proper use of detail encoding to separate individual streamlines and order encoding
    for correct line drawing
  - Well-balanced streamline density with multiple radii covering the full flow field
  - Title and font sizes meet all readability requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units - should be "X Position (units)" or specify dimensionless
  - Some inner streamlines appear slightly crowded/overlapping near the center
  - Does not leverage Altair interactive features (tooltips, zoom/pan) which would
    enhance flow exploration
