review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent label placement with nudge_y preventing overlap
  - Clean minimal theme appropriate for annotated scatter plot
  - Well-chosen data spread prevents label collisions
  - Proper use of plotnine grammar of graphics syntax
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (add alpha parameter if possible)
  - Point size could be slightly larger for only 10 data points (size=8-10 would be
    more visible)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter chart showing 10 technology companies
    plotted by Annual Revenue ($ Millions) on the x-axis and Profit Margin (%) on
    the y-axis. Each blue circular data point (with alpha transparency ~0.7) has its
    company name label positioned directly above it in dark gray text. Companies range
    from TechCorp (lowest: ~$35M revenue, ~6% margin) to AI Labs (highest: ~$200M
    revenue, ~23% margin). The plot uses a clean minimal theme with subtle gray grid
    lines. The title "scatter-annotated · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    All text is clearly legible with appropriate font sizes.'
