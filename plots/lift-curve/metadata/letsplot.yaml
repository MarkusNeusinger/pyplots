review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent lift curve implementation with proper mathematical calculation of cumulative
    lift ratio
  - Clear reference line at y=1 with helpful annotation explaining random selection
    baseline
  - 'Well-chosen data: beta distributions create realistic score separation between
    positive/negative classes'
  - Decile markers (points at 10% intervals) aid interpretation per spec recommendation
  - 'Proper lets-plot idioms: ggsize for dimensions, scale=3 for 4800x2700 output,
    theme customization'
  weaknesses:
  - None significant - implementation is publication quality
  image_description: The plot displays a lift curve with a blue line (#306998) starting
    at approximately lift value 5 at 0% population, gradually decreasing to lift value
    1 at 100% population. The x-axis shows "Population Targeted (%)" from 0-100 in
    increments of 10. The y-axis shows "Cumulative Lift" with values 1-5. A horizontal
    dashed gray reference line at y=1 represents random selection, annotated with
    "Random (Lift = 1)" near the right side. Blue dots mark decile points along the
    curve. The title "lift-curve · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at top left. Minimal
    theme with subtle gray grid lines.
