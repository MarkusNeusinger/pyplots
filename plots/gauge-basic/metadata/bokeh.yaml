review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clean, professional appearance
  - Proper implementation of semi-circular gauge with three distinct color zones
  - Clear needle indicator with triangular shape and center hub
  - Prominent value display below gauge (48pt bold)
  - Correct title format following pyplots conventions
  - Well-proportioned layout utilizing canvas space effectively
  - Clean KISS code structure with deterministic data
  weaknesses:
  - Color zones use red-green which may be challenging for colorblind users; consider
    using blue/orange/green or adding patterns
  - Could use Bokeh annular_wedge glyph for simpler arc rendering instead of manual
    polygon patches
