review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data scenario with server response time monitoring including
    daily/weekly patterns and anomaly spikes
  - Smart use of mplcursors library to add hover tooltips, demonstrating matplotlib
    extensibility
  - Well-designed visual demonstration of hover tooltip with yellow annotation
  - Good visual indication of zoom region with teal shading and instructional text
  - Proper anomaly highlighting with red triangle markers and labeled annotations
  - Text sizing follows guidelines perfectly (24pt title, 20pt labels, 16pt ticks)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows mplcursors enabled which is technical implementation detail, not
    user-meaningful information
  - Footer text partially overlaps with the x-axis Time label area
  - The @cursor.connect decorator introduces a function, breaking the KISS principle
    of pure linear flow
