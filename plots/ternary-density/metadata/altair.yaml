review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of ternary coordinates with proper Cartesian transformation
  - Clean layer composition with grid → heatmap → triangle → labels ordering
  - Sophisticated KDE calculation using scipy.stats.gaussian_kde with Scott bandwidth
  - Proper triangle masking using half-plane method
  - Good use of Altair declarative style for building complex visualizations
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Realistic geological sediment data with three distinct composition clusters
  weaknesses:
  - Minor jagged edges at triangle boundary due to square marks not perfectly aligned
    with diagonal edges
  - Spec mentions contour lines at key density levels - not implemented (optional)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a ternary density diagram representing sediment
    composition with three components: Sand (%), Silt (%), and Clay (%). The density
    is visualized using the viridis colormap, with yellow indicating high density
    (~5) and dark purple indicating low density (~1). Three distinct density clusters
    are clearly visible: (1) a sandy sediment cluster in the lower-left corner, (2)
    a silty sediment cluster in the lower-right corner, and (3) a clay-rich sediment
    cluster in the upper region. The equilateral triangle has a solid black outline
    (3px stroke), subtle grid lines (10% intervals) visible beneath the density layer
    with 40% opacity, and vertex labels positioned clearly outside the triangle boundary.
    The title follows the correct format "Sediment Composition · ternary-density ·
    altair · pyplots.ai". The density legend is positioned on the right side with
    appropriate font sizes (title 20pt, labels 16pt).'
