review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Radar chart as wind rose approximation with layered filled
    areas
  - Colorblind-safe blue gradient palette with good contrast between layers
  - Realistic meteorological data showing dominant westerly winds pattern
  - Clean KISS code structure with well-organized Style configuration
  - Proper 4800x2700 landscape dimensions with scaled font sizes
  - Legend at bottom with 4 columns provides clear series identification
  weaknesses:
  - Radar chart polygons connect vertices rather than showing discrete bars radiating
    from center (pygal limitation)
  - Title uses hyphen instead of middle dot separator after descriptive part
  - Grid lines slightly prominent; could use more subtle styling
