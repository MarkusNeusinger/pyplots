review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 270-degree arc layout with ring labels placed in the gap — clean and
    readable design choice
  - Ring background fills with semantically meaningful color progression (green to
    yellow to orange to pink) enhance data interpretation
  - Realistic, recognizable technology data with plausible time-horizon assignments
  - Full spec compliance — all required features are implemented
  - Side-based label alignment (hjust=0 for right side, hjust=1 for left side) is
    a smart approach to label readability
  weaknesses:
  - Label crowding in the AI & ML / Sustainability boundary area and near Edge Computing
    / Service Mesh — needs better angular jittering or reduced label density in tight
    spots
  - Significant whitespace below the chart and between chart and bottom legend — vertical
    space is underutilized
  - Innovation item labels (size=8) could be slightly larger for better readability
    at the final resolution
  - Blue and purple sector colors lack sufficient contrast for colorblind accessibility
    — consider using more distinct hues
  image_description: 'The plot displays an innovation radar using a 270-degree arc
    layout on a white square canvas (3600x3600 px). Four concentric rings represent
    time horizons — "Adopt" (innermost, green-tinted fill), "Trial" (yellow-tinted),
    "Assess" (orange-tinted), and "Hold" (outermost, pink-tinted). Ring labels are
    placed in the 90-degree gap at the top center. Four sectors divide the arc: "AI
    & ML" (upper-left, blue dots), "Infrastructure" (upper-right, orange dots), "Sustainability"
    (lower-left, green dots), and "Biotech" (lower-right, purple dots). Sector names
    appear in large bold text along the outer edge. Gray spokes and ring boundaries
    provide structure. 24 innovation items are plotted as colored dots with text labels
    extending radially outward. A bottom legend maps sector names to dot colors. The
    title "radar-innovation-timeline · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears top-left. Notable
    issues: label crowding in the AI & ML / Sustainability boundary area ("Carbon
    Tracking", "Green Cloud", "Biodegradable PCBs" cluster), and near-overlapping
    labels around "Edge Computing" / "Service Mesh" on the right side.'
