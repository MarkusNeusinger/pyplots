review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using plotnine grammar of graphics with geom_polygon for
    manual state shapes
  - Good use of annotations to represent breadcrumb navigation and instructions
  - Appropriate acknowledgment in subtitle that drill-down requires interactive library
  - Well-designed color gradient using Python brand colors (yellow/blue)
  - Proper use of coord_fixed for geographic aspect ratio
  - Excellent code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Plotnine cannot implement true drill-down interactivity (acknowledged in code
    comments)
  - State polygons are simplified approximations rather than accurate geographic boundaries
  - Large empty whitespace area below the map could be better utilized
  - State labels could be slightly larger for optimal readability at full resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a choropleth-style map of 14 US states using
    simplified polygon shapes on a light blue-gray background. States are filled with
    a gradient from yellow (low performance ~60) to teal-blue (high performance ~90+).
    Each state shows its two-letter abbreviation and performance score (e.g., "CA
    85", "NY 91"). A breadcrumb navigation "World > USA > States" appears at the top
    left in teal/blue text, with an italicized instruction below it stating "Click
    any state to drill down to cities (interactive version)". The title follows the
    correct format "map-drilldown-geographic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle
    explaining this is a static view. A color legend on the right shows the "Performance
    Score" scale from 60 to 90. State boundaries are outlined in white. The map uses
    a fixed aspect ratio and has clean, minimal styling.
