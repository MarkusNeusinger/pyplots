review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of Gapminder-style visualization with realistic country
    data
  - Correct fallback approach using faceted view for library without native animation
    support
  - Well-formatted title following exact spec requirements
  - Good use of lets-plot grammar of graphics features (scales, faceting, theming)
  - Proper sizing with ggsize(1600, 900) and scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Spec suggests large year indicator per panel for Gapminder storytelling feel -
    facet strip labels work but larger text could enhance the visualization
  - Some point overlap in the 2019 panel where multiple countries converge at higher
    GDP/life expectancy values
