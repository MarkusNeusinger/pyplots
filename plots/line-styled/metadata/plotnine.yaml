  - Good color palette with distinct colors for each product line
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units

  weaknesses:

  - Yellow line (Product B) has reduced contrast against the light background
  - X-axis shows decimal quarters (2.5, 5.0, etc.) rather than meaningful labels like
