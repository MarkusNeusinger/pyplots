review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly interactive features (rangeslider, rangeselector, hover
    templates)
  - Well-crafted realistic data with daily cycles, trend, noise, and anomaly spikes
  - Perfect title format following pyplots conventions
  - Clean visual design with appropriate text sizes and layout
  - Good use of hovertemplate for formatted datetime and percentage display
  weaknesses:
  - Missing visible legend in the plot (trace has name but legend not shown)
  - Pandas import is unnecessary - could use numpy for date generation
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart showing "Server Metrics · line-interactive
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" as the title. The chart uses a blue line (#306998) to show
    CPU Usage (%) over 7 days (Jan 1-7, 2024). The Y-axis ranges from 0 to 100% with
    clear "CPU Usage (%)" label. The X-axis shows "Date & Time" with daily tick marks.
    The data exhibits daily cyclical patterns with peaks reaching ~65-75% and troughs
    around 10-30%. Notable interactive features visible: range selector buttons (1d,
    3d, All) in top-left with "All" highlighted in yellow, and a range slider at the
    bottom showing a miniature version of the full dataset. The layout is clean with
    a white background, subtle grid lines, and well-proportioned margins.'
