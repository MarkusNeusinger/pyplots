review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of horizon chart concept with proper band folding logic
  - Realistic and compelling data scenario (server CPU monitoring)
  - Good use of facet_wrap for comparing multiple time series
  - Appropriate diverging color scheme with blue/red for positive/negative
  - Clean code structure following KISS principle
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is completely hidden, making it difficult to understand what the color
    bands represent without prior knowledge
  - Y-axis label says Deviation Band (%) but actually shows band-folded values, not
    true deviation percentages
  - Could benefit from a color key or annotation explaining the band system
  - Red-blue diverging scheme may be challenging for red-green colorblind users; consider
    using a colorblind-safe diverging palette
