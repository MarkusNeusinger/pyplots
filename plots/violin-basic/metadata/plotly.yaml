review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts and clean layout
  - Perfect spec compliance with all required features (box plot inside violin, median
    line, mirrored density)
  - Realistic salary distribution data that demonstrates violin plot advantages (different
    spreads, means)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette uses two similar blues and two similar yellows which slightly reduces
    category distinction
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates
  - Data could include one bimodal distribution to better showcase violin plot capabilities
    over box plots
  image_description: 'The plot displays four violin plots representing salary distributions
    across four departments: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and Support. Each violin
    shows a mirrored kernel density estimation with an embedded white box plot showing
    quartiles and a dashed median line. The color scheme alternates between blue (#306998,
    #4B8BBE) for Engineering and Sales, and yellow (#FFD43B, #FFE873) for Marketing
    and Support. The title "violin-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the
    top. The y-axis shows "Annual Salary ($)" ranging from ~20,000 to ~140,000 with
    comma-formatted tick labels. The x-axis shows "Department" with the four category
    labels. The layout uses a clean white template with subtle gridlines. Sales shows
    the widest distribution (highest variance), while Support shows the narrowest
    and lowest salary range.'

        comment: Shows different distribution shapes and spreads well; Sales has high
          variance, Support has low variance and lower mean - demonstrates violin
          advantages. Could show more multimodality.
