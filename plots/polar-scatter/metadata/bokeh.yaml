review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual construction of polar coordinate system in Bokeh (which lacks
    native polar support)
  - Realistic wind data with prevailing directions showing real-world patterns
  - Clean color scheme with good category differentiation
  - Well-proportioned layout using square format appropriate for polar plots
  - Comprehensive angular labeling with cardinal and intermediate directions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned somewhat far from the plot area
  - Radius labels (5, 10, 15...) are small relative to other text elements
  - Does not fully leverage Bokeh interactive capabilities (hover tooltips showing
    exact angle/speed)
