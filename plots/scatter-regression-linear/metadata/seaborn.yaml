review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn regplot function with built-in confidence interval
  - Perfect title format matching the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - R² and regression equation annotation clearly displayed in a styled box
  - Good color choices with Python blue for points and yellow for regression line
  - Appropriate marker size and alpha for the data density (80 points)
  - Realistic educational context (study hours vs exam scores)
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label Study Hours could include units like Study Hours (h) for full marks
    on VQ-06
  image_description: 'The plot shows a scatter plot with blue circular markers (color
    #306998) representing exam scores vs study hours. A golden yellow regression line
    (#FFD43B) runs through the data with a light yellow semi-transparent 95% confidence
    interval band. The title "scatter-regression-linear · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top in large font. The x-axis is labeled "Study Hours" (range 0-11) and
    the y-axis is labeled "Exam Score (%)" (range 30-100). A white annotation box
    in the upper left shows the regression equation (y = 5.30x + 43.2) and R² = 0.800.
    The plot has a subtle gray dashed grid, and the data points show a clear positive
    correlation with appropriate scatter around the regression line.'
