review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent use of the spec-required features: percentage labels on slices, distinct
    colorblind-safe colors, legend, and slight explosion on Engineering slice for
    emphasis'
  - Clean, professional appearance with white slice borders adding visual separation
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that clearly demonstrates parts-to-whole
    relationship
  - Proper use of plotly graph_objects API with appropriate sizing (4800x2700)
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Layout slightly unbalanced with more whitespace on left side compared to right
    where legend is positioned
  - Could use plotly hovertemplate for richer interactivity in the HTML version
  - Slice size distribution is fairly uniform (35/25/20/12/8) - more extreme variation
    would better demonstrate the plot type ability to show disparate proportions
  image_description: The plot displays a pie chart showing "Budget allocation by department"
    with 5 distinct slices. The Engineering slice (35%) is in Python Blue (#306998)
    and is slightly exploded/pulled out for emphasis. Marketing (25%) is bright yellow,
    Sales (20%) is teal, Operations (12%) is coral/salmon, and HR (8%) is light green.
    Each slice displays both the category name and percentage directly on it. The
    title "pie-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in a clean font.
    A vertical legend on the right side lists all five departments with their corresponding
    color squares. White borders cleanly separate each slice. The overall layout is
    clean with a white background.

          and generates interactive HTML. Could leverage more plotly-specific features
          like hover templates.
  verdict: APPROVED
