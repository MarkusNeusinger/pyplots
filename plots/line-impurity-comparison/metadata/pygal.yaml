review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance — all required features present including formulas in
    legend and max impurity annotation
  - Excellent data handling with proper edge case management (nan_to_num for log(0))
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS pattern
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with strong visual contrast between curves
  - Effective use of the dashed vertical line at p=0.5 for data storytelling
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom margin (220px) creates excess whitespace below the plot area, reducing
    canvas utilization
  - Axis labels could be more descriptive (e.g., add domain notation or units context)
  - Visual design is solid but lacks extra polish for publication quality — consider
    subtle enhancements like font weight differentiation or a more refined grid appearance
  - The vertical dashed marker line could be complemented with a small text annotation
    near p=0.5 to strengthen the storytelling
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth curves on a clean white background
    comparing Gini impurity and entropy as decision tree splitting criteria. The blue
    curve (Gini: 2p(1−p)) forms a parabola peaking at 0.5 on the y-axis at p=0.5.
    The orange curve (Entropy: −p log₂p − (1−p) log₂(1−p)) forms a broader bell shape
    peaking at 1.0 at p=0.5. A dashed gray vertical line marks p=0.5 (maximum impurity
    point) with small dots at both endpoints. The x-axis is labeled "Probability p"
    (range 0–1), the y-axis is labeled "Impurity Measure" (range 0–1.05). The title
    reads "line-impurity-comparison · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The legend is
    positioned at the bottom with three entries showing formulas. Lines are thick
    and clearly distinguishable. The layout is well-proportioned with generous margins.'
