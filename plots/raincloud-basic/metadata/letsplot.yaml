review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the raincloud visual metaphor with cloud (half-violin)
    on right, boxplot in middle, rain (jittered points) on left
  - Treatment B effectively demonstrates bimodal distribution capability - a key feature
    for raincloud plots
  - Interactive tooltips on all elements enhance the HTML output
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper seeding
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between groups
  - Proper use of lets-plot show_half parameter for half-violin effect
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position at bottom-right slightly intrudes into the data area; consider
    top-right or outside placement
  - Jittered rain points are uniformly dark gray instead of matching condition colors,
    which reduces visual cohesion
  image_description: 'The plot displays a raincloud visualization for three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) comparing reaction times in milliseconds.
    Each condition shows:

    - **Half-violin (cloud)**: Positioned on the right side of each category in distinct
    colors - blue for Control, yellow for Treatment A, and green for Treatment B

    - **Box plot**: White/gray boxplots centered-left showing median, quartiles, and
    whiskers

    - **Jittered points (rain)**: Dark gray scatter points positioned to the left
    of the boxplots

    - **Colors**: Blue (#306998), Yellow (#FFD43B), Green (#5BA85B) - colorblind-friendly
    palette

    - **Title**: "raincloud-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" at top

    - **Axes**: Y-axis "Reaction Time (ms)" ranging 200-700, X-axis "Experimental
    Condition"

    - **Legend**: Positioned in bottom-right showing condition colors

    - **Layout**: Clean minimal theme with subtle horizontal grid lines'

  verdict: APPROVED
