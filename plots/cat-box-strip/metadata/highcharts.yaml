review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent combination of box plot and strip plot overlay demonstrating the spec
    requirements perfectly
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Realistic and neutral data scenario (plant growth under light conditions)
  - Proper jitter implementation for strip points to show data distribution
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot area rather than in the top-right
    corner
  - Some minor empty space at the top of the chart could be reduced
  - Median line (yellow) blends slightly with the strip points (also yellow) - different
    styling could improve distinction
