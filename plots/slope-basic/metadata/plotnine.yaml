review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of slope chart using plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Clear color distinction between increasing (blue) and decreasing (yellow) trends
  - Labels at both endpoints with entity names on left and values on right
  - Good figure sizing (16x9) and text scaling for readability
  - Minimal theme with appropriate grid removal (no vertical gridlines)
  - Realistic business scenario (quarterly product sales) matching spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap around similar values (Product J 180 / Product F 175)
  - Right-side labels could include product names for very long charts
  - Legend could be positioned differently to save horizontal space
