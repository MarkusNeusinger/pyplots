review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of asymmetric error bars with clear visual distinction
    between upper and lower bounds
  - Proper use of error bar caps (width=12) making the extent clearly visible
  - Well-chosen data that demonstrates both right-skewed and left-skewed distributions
  - Clean annotation explaining what the error bars represent, as required by the
    specification
  - Good font sizing throughout for the 4800x2700 output resolution
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML outputs
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned at very top-left corner feels slightly disconnected from the
    data
  - Could leverage Plotly hover templates to show exact upper/lower error values on
    hover
  image_description: The plot displays 6 products (A through F) on the x-axis with
    their quarterly sales values on the y-axis (ranging 0-140 thousands USD). Each
    product is represented by a blue circular marker (#306998) with asymmetric vertical
    error bars extending above and below. The error bars have clear horizontal caps
    at both ends. The title "errorbar-asymmetric · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. A legend in the upper-left corner explains "Median Sales (10th-90th
    percentile)". An annotation in the lower-right states "Error bars show 10th-90th
    percentile range". The background is white with subtle gray gridlines. The asymmetry
    is clearly visible - for example, Product E shows a much larger upper error bar
    (~35) than lower (~18), while Product C shows a larger lower error bar (~15) than
    upper (~10).

        comment: Grid is appropriately subtle (alpha 0.1), but legend placement could
          be improved - it's positioned at the very top-left corner which feels slightly
          disconnected

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with error_y for asymmetric errors, which is standard
          Plotly. Also generates HTML for interactivity. Could have used hover templates
          for enhanced interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
