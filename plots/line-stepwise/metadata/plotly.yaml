quality_score: 98
review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect implementation of step function using Plotly shape=hv parameter
  - Excellent realistic data scenario (server response time monitoring over 24 hours)
  - Clean code following KISS principles with proper font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Interactive HTML output with custom hover template showing hour and response time
  - Well-balanced layout with good canvas utilization
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: Grid/legend criterion loses 2 points due to disabled legend, though acceptable
    for single-series plots'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a step line chart showing server response
    time (in milliseconds) over a 24-hour period. The visualization uses a blue color
    (#306998) for both the stepped line (width 4) and circular markers with white
    borders. The x-axis shows "Hour of Day" ranging from 0 to 22 in increments of
    2. The y-axis shows "Response Time (ms)" ranging from approximately 40 to 90.
    The step pattern clearly shows horizontal segments (constant values) followed
    by vertical transitions at each hour mark. The data demonstrates a realistic daily
    pattern: low values (~42-45ms) during early morning hours, gradual increase during
    morning ramp-up, peak around midday (~90ms at hour 13), and decline in evening
    back to low values (~43ms). The title "line-stepwise · plotly · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top. White background with subtle gray grid lines. Clean, professional
    appearance.'
