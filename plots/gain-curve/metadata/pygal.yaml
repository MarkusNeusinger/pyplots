review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of cumulative gains chart with model curve and random baseline
  - Excellent color contrast (blue vs gray) for colorblind accessibility
  - Good custom styling with appropriate font sizes for large canvas (4800×2700)
  - Clean KISS code structure following linear flow pattern
  - Proper axis labels with percentage units
  - Correct title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Appropriate data sampling (every 2%) for smooth pygal rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-left corner is outside the main plot area and appears
    isolated
  - Could add a Perfect Model reference line (vertical to 100% at positive rate, then
    horizontal) as mentioned in spec notes
