review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and colorblind-safe
    palette
  - Correct implementation of ROC curve with all required features (diagonal reference,
    AUC in legend, multiple models)
  - Uses coord_fixed(ratio=1) for equal aspect ratio as recommended in spec
  - Clean ggplot grammar of graphics approach with appropriate theme customization
  - Proper scale 3x export for 4800x2700 resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Code contains a function definition (compute_roc) which violates the KISS principle
    - should be inline calculations
  - Grid alpha not explicitly set (could be more subtle)
