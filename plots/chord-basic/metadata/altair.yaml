review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of chord diagram using Altair mark_line for both
    arcs and chords
  - Clean color palette with good contrast and distinct colors for each continent
  - Proper proportional sizing of both arcs (based on total flow) and chords (based
    on individual flow values)
  - Well-structured code with clear separation of data preparation, arc generation,
    and chord path calculation
  - Tooltips enabled for interactivity showing From/To/Flow information
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated
  weaknesses:
  - Chord diagram is not a native Altair chart type, requiring significant manual
    geometry calculations which reduces the declarative advantage of Altair
  - Labels could benefit from slight rotation for better alignment with arc positions
  - Flow values lack units in the data context
  image_description: 'The plot displays a chord diagram showing migration flows between
    6 continents. The outer ring consists of colored arc segments: Europe (dark blue
    #306998), North America (golden yellow #FFD43B), Asia (teal #4ECDC4), Africa (coral
    red #FF6B6B), South America (light green/mint #95E1D3), and Oceania (purple #A86EDB).
    Each continent''s arc size is proportional to its total flow volume. Semi-transparent
    chords connect the continents with widths corresponding to flow magnitudes. Labels
    are positioned outside each arc segment with matching colors. The title "chord-basic
    · altair · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top center. A legend is present on
    the right side showing the Region color mapping.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative grammar with layering, tooltips enabled
          for interactivity, HTML export. However, chord diagrams are not a native
          Altair chart type, requiring manual construction.
  verdict: APPROVED
