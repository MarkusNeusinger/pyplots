review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of step histogram using manual coordinate calculation
    for the step function appearance
  - Clean comparison of two distributions without visual overlap issues (outline-only
    approach)
  - Proper use of colorblind-safe color palette (blue and yellow)
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Good font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears small relative to other text elements despite having label_text_font_size
    set
  - Could demonstrate more variety in the distributions (different spreads or shapes)
