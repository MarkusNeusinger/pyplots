review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of the elbow curve with excellent readability
  - Optimal k value (elbow point) is highlighted with a distinct larger yellow marker
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with full context
  - Clean KISS code structure following pygal best practices
  - Good color contrast between the main line and elbow highlight
  - Data realistically demonstrates the diminishing returns pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned quite far from the plot area at the bottom
  - Could use pygal built-in annotation or tooltip features to enhance the elbow point
    indication
  image_description: The plot displays an elbow curve for K-means clustering with
    a blue line connecting data points from k=1 to k=10. The y-axis shows "Inertia
    (Within-cluster Sum of Squares)" ranging from 0 to approximately 4400, while the
    x-axis shows "Number of Clusters (k)" with integer values 1-10. Blue circular
    markers appear at each k value, connected by a smooth blue line. A larger yellow/gold
    marker highlights the optimal elbow point at k=4. The title "elbow-curve · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom shows "Inertia" (blue)
    and "Optimal k" (yellow). The background is clean white with subtle horizontal
    grid lines. The characteristic elbow shape is clearly visible with a steep decline
    from k=1 (4200) to k=4 (680), then flattening out.

        comment: Uses pygal XY chart, custom Style, legend positioning, dots_size
          customization. Could have used more pygal-specific features like tooltips
          or value formatting.
