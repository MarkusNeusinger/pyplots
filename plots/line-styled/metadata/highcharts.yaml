review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all 4 required line styles (Solid, Dash, Dot, DashDot)
    using Highcharts native dash_style property
  - Realistic, geographically appropriate temperature data for European cities showing
    clear seasonal patterns
  - Clean, colorblind-safe color palette that works well with line style differentiation
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Good use of margins and layout for the 4800x2700 canvas size
  - Thick line widths (6px) and large markers (10px radius) ensure visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend symbols do not clearly show the different dash patterns - they appear as
    similar horizontal lines, making it harder to match legend to plot lines by style
    alone
  - Grid line alpha could be slightly higher (0.2-0.3) for better readability while
    maintaining subtlety
