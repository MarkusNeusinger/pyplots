review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom implementation of parallel categories using geom_polygon for
    ribbons and geom_rect for nodes
  - Smooth curved ribbon transitions using easing function create professional appearance
  - Good color scheme with channel-based coloring following spec recommendation
  - Proper flow proportionality showing observation counts
  - Dimension headers clearly labeled with counts
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  - Realistic e-commerce customer journey scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of KISS flat structure (though complexity of
    manual implementation may justify this)
  - Some category labels appear slightly truncated or crowded near nodes
  - Category label text size (11) could be larger for better readability at full resolution
