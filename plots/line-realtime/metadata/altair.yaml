review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the sliding window concept with visual fade effect
    on older points
  - Creative use of multiple Altair layers (area, line, points, annotations) for rich
    visualization
  - Realistic CPU usage data with sinusoidal pattern and random spikes
  - Clear current value annotation with contrasting yellow highlight
  - LIVE indicator and scroll direction arrow add to the real-time feeling
  - Correct title format and appropriate axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Grid is very subtle (gridOpacity=0.3) - could be slightly more visible for easier
    value reading
  - No legend present (minor issue for single-series plot)
  - The HTML output could include interactivity (pan/zoom, tooltips) since Altair
    excels at this
  image_description: 'The plot displays a real-time CPU usage monitoring chart with
    a blue line (#306998) showing values ranging from approximately 19% to 67% over
    a ~1.5 minute time window. The chart features a light blue semi-transparent area
    fill beneath the line, creating a gradient effect. The Y-axis shows "CPU Usage
    (%)" with a scale from 0-100, while the X-axis displays "Time" with timestamps
    in HH:MM:SS format (14:28:25 to 14:30:00). The title correctly follows the format
    "line-realtime · altair · pyplots.ai". A red "● LIVE" indicator appears in the
    upper right area. The current/latest value is prominently highlighted with a yellow
    circle marker and "Current: 34.3%" annotation. A yellow arrow-shaped scroll direction
    indicator appears on the left side of the chart. Data points along the line show
    a fade effect (older points are smaller/more transparent), effectively indicating
    the sliding window concept. The data shows realistic CPU usage patterns with a
    sinusoidal oscillation and several spikes.'
