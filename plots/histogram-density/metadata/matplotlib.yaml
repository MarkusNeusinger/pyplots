review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent specification compliance with density histogram and theoretical PDF
    overlay
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Great color contrast between histogram bars and PDF curve
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Realistic test score data scenario with appropriate sample size (n=500)
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features like fill_between for PDF shading
    or axvline for mean
  - Legend positioned in upper left slightly overlaps with potential data area
  image_description: 'The plot displays a density histogram with blue bars representing
    test score distribution (labeled "Observed Distribution"). The x-axis shows "Test
    Score (points)" ranging from 30 to 110, while the y-axis shows "Probability Density"
    ranging from 0.000 to 0.040. A yellow/gold curve overlays the histogram showing
    the theoretical Normal PDF (μ=75, σ=12). The histogram bars have white edges and
    semi-transparent fill (alpha=0.7). The legend is positioned in the upper left
    corner. A subtle grid with dashed lines is visible. The title follows the required
    format: "histogram-density · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".'

        comment: Uses basic matplotlib features (hist with density, plot), but could
          leverage more distinctive features like fill_between for PDF area, or axvline
          for mean indicator
  verdict: APPROVED
