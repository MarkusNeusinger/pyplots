review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling with three annotated outliers and correlation coefficient
    — goes well beyond just plotting points
  - 'Professional aesthetic: custom blue/orange palette, white marker edges, subtle
    grid, off-white paper background'
  - All font sizes explicitly set and well-calibrated for 4800×2700 output
  - Plotly-distinctive features used effectively (hovertemplate, HTML export, hoverlabel
    styling)
  - Clean, well-structured code with elegant annotation dict-spread pattern
  weaknesses:
  - Minor annotation congestion in the bottom-right between 'High effort, low score'
    (8.5, 52) and 'Underperformer' (9.2, 55) — arrows nearly overlap
  - Layout margins asymmetric (L=80 vs R=40) leading to slightly unbalanced whitespace
    distribution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a scatter plot of "Study Hours (h)" (x-axis,
    range 0–11) vs "Exam Score (%)" (y-axis, range ~35–105) with 120 blue circular
    markers (#306998) at opacity 0.6 with white edge outlines on a white background
    with very subtle gray grid lines. A dashed blue trend line shows the positive
    correlation. Three orange (#D4782F) diamond markers highlight outliers: "Low effort,
    high score" at (~2h, 78%), "High effort, low score" at (~8.5h, 52%), and "Underperformer"
    at (~9.2h, 55%). Each outlier has a bordered orange annotation box with an arrow
    pointing to the marker. The correlation coefficient "r = 0.79" is displayed in
    blue near the upper portion of the trend line. The title "scatter-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in dark bold text. The paper background is
    a light off-white (#FAFBFC). Overall the plot has a clean, professional appearance
    with clear data storytelling.'
