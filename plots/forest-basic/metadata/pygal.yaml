review:
  strengths:
  - Good use of pygal XY chart type for forest plot structure
  - Y-axis labels include study names with CI values for good information density
  - Weight-based marker sizing implemented correctly
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled fonts
  weaknesses:
  - Pooled estimate displayed as circular dot instead of traditional diamond shape
    required by specification
  - Helper function get_dot_size() violates KISS principle; inline calculation preferred
  - Legend shows generic labels rather than being more descriptive or hidden
  - CI whisker shadow/hatching effect creates visual clutter
