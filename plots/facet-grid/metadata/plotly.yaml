review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation using Plotly Express native faceting capability (facet_row,
    facet_col)
  - Excellent data generation with realistic business scenario (marketing spend vs
    sales by region and quarter)
  - Good visual hierarchy with clear title, readable axis labels with units, and subtle
    grid
  - Produces both PNG and HTML output leveraging Plotly interactivity
  - Proper use of template=plotly_white for clean appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend showing regions is redundant since region is already encoded by facet rows
  - Markers could be slightly larger (15-18 instead of 12) for better visibility with
    ~15 points per facet
  - Row facet labels are displayed vertically which reduces readability compared to
    horizontal text
