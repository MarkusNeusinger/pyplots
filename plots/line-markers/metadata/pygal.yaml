review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with well-scaled font sizes for the large canvas
  - Clear colorblind-safe color palette (blue, yellow, red)
  - Proper use of pygal marker functionality with show_dots=True and dots_size=16
  - Realistic temperature sensor scenario with appropriate seasonal variation
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent, professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper left creates slight visual imbalance; positioning at
    bottom would be better
  - Grid lines only on Y-axis; could add subtle X-guides for complete reference
  - Marker visibility good but does not use different marker shapes for series as
    suggested in spec notes (pygal limitation)
