review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-positioned labels and counts in all 7 regions
  - Creative implementation using geom_polygon to construct Venn circles from coordinate
    data
  - Good color choices (blue/yellow/pink) with appropriate transparency for overlap
    visualization
  - Realistic and relatable data context (research field skills overlap)
  - Proper title format and square aspect ratio appropriate for the diagram type
  weaknesses:
  - File output requires os workaround to move files from lets-plot-images subdirectory
  - Could use geom_path instead of geom_polygon with size parameter for circle borders
    (minor)
