review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine composition operators (| and /) to create mosaic-like
    layout
  - Colorblind-accessible blue/yellow palette consistently applied across all panels
  - Rich variety of geom types (geom_line, geom_point, geom_bar, geom_tile, geom_text)
    demonstrating plotnine versatility
  - Realistic business dashboard scenario with coherent product performance narrative
  - Proper use of pd.Categorical for ordered axis labels in bar charts and heatmap
  weaknesses:
  - Top row panels appear equal size rather than A spanning 2/3 as indicated; mosaic
    layout approximation could better show size hierarchy
  - Text sizes could be increased slightly for the final 4800x2700 output (title is
    28pt but axis text is 11pt)
  - The heatmap legend is somewhat separated from its panel due to spacing
