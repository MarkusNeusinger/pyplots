review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent declarative Altair syntax with proper encoding types (N for nominal,
    Q for quantitative)
  - Clean data-to-visualization mapping using pandas DataFrame
  - 'Good use of Altair-specific features: cornerRadius for rounded bars, tooltip
    configuration, sort parameter'
  - Currency formatting on Y-axis with format=$,.0f
  - Proper export to both PNG and HTML for interactivity
  - Bars sorted by value (descending) enhances readability and comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Image dimensions (4500x2400) slightly below target specification (4800x2700);
    should use width=1600 for exact match
  - No value labels on or above bars as suggested in the specification Notes section
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product sales
    by category. Seven blue bars (#306998) with subtle rounded top corners are arranged
    in descending order from left to right. Categories shown are: Electronics (~$45,200),
    Clothing (~$32,100), Home & Garden (~$28,400), Sports (~$21,800), Books (~$18,500),
    Toys (~$15,200), and Food (~$12,300). The Y-axis displays "Sales ($)" with currency
    formatting from $0 to $50,000. X-axis labels are rotated -45 degrees and show
    "Product Category". The title reads "bar-basic · altair · pyplots.ai". A subtle
    dashed grid is visible in the background. All text is clearly readable.'

        comment: Uses Altair's declarative encoding, tooltips, sort parameter, and
          cornerRadius styling; could leverage more interactive features like selection
          or conditional encoding
  verdict: APPROVED
