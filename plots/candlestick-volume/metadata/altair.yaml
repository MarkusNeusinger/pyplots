review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 75/25 vertical split between price and
    volume
  - Clean candlestick implementation using layered wicks (mark_rule) and bodies (mark_bar)
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme consistently applied across both panes
  - Comprehensive tooltips showing all OHLC values and volume
  - Realistic 60-day stock data generation with appropriate volatility and volume
    correlation
  - Proper title formatting per pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Missing grid lines - spec explicitly requests subtle grid lines aligned across
    both panes
  - Legend defined in code but not included in the final combined chart
  - Missing crosshair/cursor that spans both panes as specified in requirements
  - No .interactive() call - misses Altair key interactivity strength for financial
    charts
