review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors (blue raw data, yellow rolling
    average) that provide strong contrast
  - Rolling average line appropriately prominent (width=4) while raw data is appropriately
    subdued (opacity=0.4)
  - Legend includes the window size (14-Day Rolling Average) as specified in the spec
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Realistic temperature scenario with believable seasonal patterns
  - Produces both PNG and interactive HTML outputs leveraging Plotly strengths
  weaknesses:
  - Grid opacity at 0.1 is almost too subtle; could be increased to 0.2-0.3 for better
    readability
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like customized hover templates showing
    both raw and rolling values, or a range selector for interactivity
