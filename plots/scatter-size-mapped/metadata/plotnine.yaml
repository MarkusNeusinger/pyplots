review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the grammar of graphics approach with proper layering
    of aesthetics
  - Clean, readable code following plotnine conventions
  - Good use of scale_size_continuous with custom breaks and labels for population
    legend
  - Realistic economic indicator scenario that demonstrates the bubble chart concept
    effectively
  - Proper title format and axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Some smaller bubbles are difficult to see against larger ones; minimum size could
    be slightly larger
  - Yellow (Asia) and green (Americas) colors could have more contrast for colorblind
    accessibility
