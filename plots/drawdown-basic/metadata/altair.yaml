review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized red filled area and clear zero baseline
  - Maximum drawdown point prominently highlighted with contrasting yellow marker
    and label
  - Good use of Altair declarative layer composition for combining area, line, baseline,
    and markers
  - Realistic multi-phase market data showing various drawdown depths and recoveries
  - Clean, KISS-compliant code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Recovery point markers (blue triangles) lack a legend explanation
  - Missing key statistics display (max drawdown duration and recovery time) mentioned
    in spec notes
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (currently alpha=0.5)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a drawdown chart spanning from January 2022
    to May 2023. The chart shows percentage drawdown values on the y-axis (ranging
    from approximately +4% to -50%) and dates on the x-axis. The drawdown area is
    filled with a semi-transparent red/salmon color (#D32F2F), with a darker red line
    (#B71C1C) outlining the top edge. A dashed black horizontal line at y=0 serves
    as the zero baseline reference. Multiple drawdown periods are visible, including
    several corrections around -16% to -32%, with the maximum drawdown of 41.7% occurring
    around September-October 2022, marked with a yellow circular marker and labeled
    "Max DD: 41.7%". The title "drawdown-basic · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top. All text is legible, axis labels are descriptive ("Date" and "Drawdown (%)"),
    and the layout is well-balanced with the plot filling most of the canvas.'
