review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent survey response scenario with realistic Likert scale data
  - Count labels above bars enhance readability as suggested in spec
  - Clean, professional appearance with removed top/right spines
  - Proper frequency-based sorting (descending) as recommended
  - Good use of edge color for bar definition
  weaknesses:
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features (hatching, gradient fills, or percentage
    annotations)
  - Minor layout inefficiency with extra whitespace on right side
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing survey response
    frequencies. Five blue bars (#306998) with darker edges are arranged in descending
    order by count: "Agree" (69), "Neutral" (47), "Disagree" (39), "Strongly Agree"
    (33), and "Strongly Disagree" (12). Bold blue count labels appear above each bar.
    The title "count-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The
    x-axis is labeled "Survey Response" and the y-axis "Count". A subtle dashed grid
    appears on the y-axis only. The top and right spines are removed for a cleaner
    appearance. All text is clearly legible.'
