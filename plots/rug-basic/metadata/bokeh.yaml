review:
  strengths:
  - Bimodal data distribution effectively demonstrates clustering and gaps as specified
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Correct title format and colorblind-safe color choice
  - Appropriate use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and segment glyph
  weaknesses:
  - Rug ticks are far too tall - they should be small tick marks at the bottom margin
    (~5% of plot height per spec notes), not vertical lines spanning half the canvas
  - The y_range of 0-1 with tick_height=0.05 does not produce visually small ticks;
    the rendering shows ticks spanning most of the visible plot area
  - Grid lines through the rug area are distracting; consider removing x-grid or positioning
    ticks outside main plot area
