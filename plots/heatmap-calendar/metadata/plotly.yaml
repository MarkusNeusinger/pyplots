review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of GitHub-style calendar heatmap with authentic
    green colorscale
  - Realistic data generation with weekend effect, burst days, and zero days showing
    natural activity patterns
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Proper handling of week numbering at year boundaries
  - Appropriate cell gaps creating the classic GitHub contribution graph look
  - Good font sizing throughout for readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Interactive HTML export leverages Plotly core strength
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra context beyond the required format
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover data showing actual
    dates
  - Colorbar title could include more context
  image_description: 'The plot displays a GitHub-style calendar heatmap for 2024 showing
    contribution activity over the full year. The layout uses a grid with 7 rows (Mon-Sun)
    and approximately 53 columns (weeks). Days are represented as cells with gaps
    between them. A sequential green colorscale (from light gray #ebedf0 for zero/empty
    to dark green #216e39 for high values) encodes contribution counts. Month labels
    (Jan-Dec) appear along the top axis. Weekday labels (Mon-Sun) are on the left
    y-axis. A vertical colorbar on the right shows the "Contributions" scale from
    0-18. The title "GitHub Activity 2024 · heatmap-calendar · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top in large font. The data shows realistic patterns: weekends
    (Sat/Sun) have generally lighter activity, with occasional burst days showing
    dark green.'
  verdict: APPROVED
