review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of damped harmonic oscillator phase space with clear spiral
    convergence to equilibrium
  - Multiple trajectories from different initial conditions effectively demonstrate
    basin of attraction concept
  - Fixed point clearly marked with distinctive red X marker
  - Starting points clearly marked with hollow circles with stroke, making trajectory
    origins easy to identify
  - Clean, professional styling with appropriate color palette and readable text at
    all sizes
  - Proper use of lets-plot grammar of graphics (ggplot, geom_path, aes mappings)
  weaknesses:
  - Legend entries show raw initial condition tuples; more descriptive labels would
    improve readability
  - Inner spiral loops become slightly dense near equilibrium; direction arrows could
    show time evolution more clearly
