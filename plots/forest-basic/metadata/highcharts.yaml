review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of forest plot with proper diamond marker for pooled
    estimate
  - Weight-proportional marker sizing implemented correctly
  - Clean visual design with subtle grid and clear reference line at null effect
  - Proper title format and informative subtitle
  - Good colorblind-safe color choices (blue/yellow)
  - X-axis label includes units and CI notation
  - Tooltip shows detailed information (effect size, CI, weight)
  weaknesses:
  - Slight gap between last study and pooled estimate could be tighter
  - Grid/legend score affected by disabled legend (though appropriate for this plot
    type)
  - Code structure has multiple series loops which adds complexity
  image_description: The plot displays a forest plot for meta-analysis with 10 studies
    plus a pooled estimate. Each study is labeled on the left (Smith et al. 2018 through
    Anderson et al. 2023) with blue square markers representing effect sizes and horizontal
    lines showing 95% confidence intervals. The pooled estimate at the bottom is shown
    as a yellow diamond with a blue border. A vertical dashed line at x=0 marks "No
    Effect" with a label at the top. The x-axis shows "Mean Difference (95% CI)" ranging
    from -1.2 to 0.8. The title reads "forest-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with
    a subtitle "Meta-Analysis of Treatment Effect on Primary Outcome". The background
    is white with very subtle dotted grid lines.
