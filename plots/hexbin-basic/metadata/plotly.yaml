review:
  strengths:
  - Creative hexbin implementation using Plotly hexagon2 markers with matching line
    colors for seamless tessellation
  - Strong data storytelling with three annotated cluster hotspots guiding the viewer
    through density landscape
  - 'Rich Plotly interactivity: custom hover tooltips with customdata/hovertemplate
    plus HTML export'
  - Clean visual design with removed grids, muted axis colors, and professional typography
  - Excellent data context with realistic ride-share scenario and appropriate scales
  weaknesses:
  - Minor tessellation gaps visible at sparse peripheral hexagons where density field
    thins out
  - Axis styling could be further refined with lighter tick marks and subtle styling
    tweaks

  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hexagonal binning visualization of ride-share
    pickup density across a metro area. Hexagonal markers in Viridis colormap (dark
    purple for low counts to bright yellow for high counts) tessellate across the
    canvas. Three distinct density clusters are visible: "Airport" (center-right,
    brightest yellow reaching ~250 pickups), "Downtown" (left side, moderate green/teal
    density), and "University" (right side, lower teal density). Each cluster is labeled
    with an annotation arrow. The x-axis shows "Distance East (km)" ranging from -10
    to ~12, the y-axis shows "Distance North (km)" from -4 to ~7. A vertical colorbar
    on the right labeled "Pickups" shows the 0-250 scale. The title reads "hexbin-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" in bold centered text. The background is a subtle off-white
    (#f8f9fa) with no grid lines, creating a clean appearance.'
