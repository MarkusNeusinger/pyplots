quality_score: 85
review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to simulate hierarchical network layout
  - Excellent color coding by hierarchy level with colorblind-safe palette
  - Clean code structure with well-organized hierarchy data dictionary
  - Proper tree layout algorithm positioning nodes by level
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels
  weaknesses:
  - Legend shows only level categories instead of individual node labels as the code
    attempts
  - Empty space below y=30 wastes canvas area
  - Edge lines are somewhat thin relative to node size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hierarchical network graph representing
    an organizational chart with 22 nodes across 4 levels. The CEO (dark blue) sits
    at the top center around y=83. Three VPs (yellow/gold) are positioned at y≈65.
    Seven Directors (teal/cyan) form the third level at y≈48. Eleven Managers (coral/salmon)
    populate the bottom level at y≈31. Grey edges connect parent-child relationships,
    creating a tree structure. The title "network-hierarchical · pygal · pyplots.ai"
    appears at top. A legend at bottom shows: Edges, CEO, VPs, Directors, Managers.
    Axes show "Organization Width" (x) and "Hierarchy Level (Top to Bottom)" (y).
    The layout clearly shows the tree hierarchy with good vertical separation between
    levels.'
