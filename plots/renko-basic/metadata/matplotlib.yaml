review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of Renko chart with clear brick structure
  - Good use of matplotlib patches for drawing uniform bricks with edge highlighting
  - Realistic synthetic price data demonstrating various market conditions (trends,
    reversals, consolidation)
  - Proper implementation of Renko algorithm respecting brick size
  - Well-balanced layout with readable fonts and appropriate spacing
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function calculate_renko_bricks() instead of inline code (violates
    KISS structure requirement)
  - Red/green color scheme, while traditional for finance, is not colorblind-safe
  image_description: The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 70 bricks
    showing price movements over time. Green bricks (#22c55e) represent bullish (price
    up) movements while red bricks (#ef4444) represent bearish (price down) movements.
    The chart begins around $100, rises to approximately $108, then shows a significant
    downtrend to around $84, followed by periods of consolidation and recovery back
    toward $108. The title "renko-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is positioned at
    the top in large font. The X-axis is labeled "Brick Number" (ranging 0-70) and
    the Y-axis shows "Price ($)" (ranging ~$82-$112). A legend in the upper left corner
    clearly identifies "Bullish (Price Up)" and "Bearish (Price Down)". A subtle horizontal
    dashed grid (alpha=0.3) aids in reading price levels. Bricks are uniform in size
    ($2 each) with small gaps between them, and each brick has a darker edge color
    for definition.
