review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent bimodal distribution demonstrates density histogram features very effectively
  - Clean visual design with proper color contrast between histogram bars and KDE
    overlay
  - Proper density normalization with clear axis labeling including units
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional value for exploration
  - Realistic cognitive psychology scenario with plausible reaction time values
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to identify the KDE line (yellow line has no label)
  - Could use Altair's built-in transform_density() instead of scipy for more idiomatic
    implementation
