review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 75/25 vertical split as specified
  - 'Professional use of Plotly features: unified hover, crosshair spikes spanning
    both panes, shared x-axis'
  - Color scheme is consistent between candlesticks and volume bars for visual coherence
  - Realistic OHLC data generation with volume correlated to price movement magnitude
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs for static and interactive viewing
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Volume axis label lacks units (should be "Volume (shares)" or similar)
  - No legend or annotation explaining that blue=up day, yellow=down day
  image_description: The plot displays a professional dual-pane candlestick chart
    with volume data spanning 60 trading days (January-March 2024). The upper pane
    (~75% height) shows OHLC candlesticks with prices ranging from ~$120 to ~$165,
    using blue (#306998) for bullish days and yellow/gold (#FFD43B) for bearish days.
    The lower pane (~25% height) displays corresponding volume bars with matching
    colors. The title "candlestick-volume · plotly · pyplots.ai" is properly centered
    at the top. Axis labels include "Price ($)" with dollar formatting and "Volume"
    with abbreviated notation (M for millions). The shared x-axis shows "Date" with
    clear date labels. Grid lines are subtle (rgba with 0.2 alpha) and aligned across
    both panes.
