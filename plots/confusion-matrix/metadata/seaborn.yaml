review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized annotations and contrasting text colors
    on cells
  - Properly follows specification with True/Predicted axis labels and Blues colormap
  - Realistic sentiment analysis scenario with believable confusion patterns showing
    systematic errors
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Square format appropriate for symmetric confusion matrix
  weaknesses:
  - Minor colorbar label duplication (label set both in cbar_kws and manually)
  - Data is deterministic but no explicit np.random.seed() for documentation purposes
