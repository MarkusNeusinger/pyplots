review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical data structure with clear parent-child relationships using
    id/parent pattern
  - Colorblind-safe palette with five distinct colors that do not conflict
  - Good use of Highcharts multi-level treemap configuration with different styling
    per level
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that demonstrates treemap utility
  weaknesses:
  - Subcategory labels in smaller rectangles could benefit from slightly larger font
    or overflow handling
  - Tooltip shows values but rectangles themselves do not display the dollar amounts
  - Could add subtle hover effects or animation to showcase Highcharts interactivity
    in HTML version
  image_description: 'The treemap displays a budget allocation visualization with
    5 main categories shown as colored rectangles. **Engineering** (blue, #306998)
    occupies the largest area in the upper-left, containing subcategories: Backend
    Dev, Frontend Dev, DevOps, and QA Testing. **Marketing** (yellow, #FFD43B) is
    in the lower-left with Digital Ads, Content, Events, and Branding. **Sales** (cyan,
    #17BECF) is in the upper-middle-right with Enterprise, SMB, and Partner. **Operations**
    (purple, #9467BD) is in the upper-right with Infrastructure, Logistics, and Facilities.
    **HR** (brown, #8C564B) is in the lower-right with Recruiting, Training, and Benefits.
    The title "Budget Allocation · treemap-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    at the top. Rectangle areas are proportional to budget values, with white borders
    separating categories and subcategories.'
