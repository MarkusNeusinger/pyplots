review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the P&F algorithm with correct box size and 3-box
    reversal logic
  - Clean use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar with appropriate aesthetics mapping
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with descriptive names and units
  - Good color choices with green/red that also include shape distinction (X/O) for
    accessibility
  - Proper handling of column-based (not time-based) X-axis which is key to P&F charts
  - High-resolution export with scale=3 for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be improved - horizontal grid is visible but could use more
    subtle alpha
  - The X and O symbols could be slightly larger/bolder for better visual impact at
    the target resolution
  - Spec mentions adding support/resistance trend lines which are not implemented
    (optional per spec)
  image_description: The plot displays a Point and Figure (P&F) chart with green X
    symbols representing rising price columns (bullish) and red O symbols representing
    falling price columns (bearish). The chart shows price movement from approximately
    $80 to $155 across 23 columns (reversal numbers 0-22). The X-axis is labeled "Column
    (Reversal Number)" and Y-axis is labeled "Price ($)". The title correctly displays
    "point-and-figure-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai". The chart demonstrates clear
    alternating columns of X's and O's with appropriate spacing, showing multiple
    trends including uptrends and downtrends. The overall layout is clean with a minimal
    theme, subtle horizontal grid lines, and no legend (appropriately hidden since
    color coding is self-explanatory).
