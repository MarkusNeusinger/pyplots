review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent demonstration of ALL wind barb features (calm circles, half barbs, full
    barbs, pennants)
  - Colorblind-safe viridis colormap with clear colorbar
  - Proper meteorological notation explanation in legend
  - Clean, readable code structure with good comments
  - Appropriate grid spacing prevents barb overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Legend notation text at bottom is slightly small (fontsize=14) compared to main
    plot text
  - Seaborn used only for styling, not distinctive plotting features (unavoidable
    for wind barbs)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a wind barb visualization on a 6×4 grid representing
    24 weather station locations. Wind barbs are color-coded using the viridis colormap
    (purple to yellow) indicating wind speed from 0 to 75 knots. The visualization
    correctly shows all standard meteorological barb features: calm winds (<2.5 knots)
    as open purple circles at three locations (bottom-left, middle-right, and top-right
    areas), moderate winds with half barbs (5 kt) and full barbs (10 kt), and strong
    winds (50+ knots) with triangular pennants visible at several locations (top-left,
    middle area, and bottom-right showing bright green/yellow coloring). The barbs
    point in various directions indicating wind direction. The colorbar on the right
    shows "Wind Speed (knots)" with clear labels. Axis labels show "Longitude (°E)"
    and "Latitude (°N)" with appropriate units. The title follows the correct format
    "windbarb-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai". A helpful legend at the bottom explains
    the barb notation conventions. The white background provides good contrast for
    the colored barbs.'

        comment: Uses matplotlib barbs() directly; seaborn only provides styling via
          set_theme/set_context. This is acceptable as seaborn has no native wind
          barb function.
