review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of value labels displayed within each segment for precise reading
  - Clean, realistic business scenario with quarterly revenue data
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Good color palette with distinguishable colors for all four categories
  - Well-configured custom style with appropriate font sizes for the large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are minimal (only one visible at y=50); adding more y-axis guides would
    improve readability
  - Could use pygal's tooltips or other interactive features more prominently
