review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean layered syntax
  - Well-implemented alternating chromosome colors using factor mapping
  - Both genome-wide and suggestive threshold lines included with appropriate styling
  - Good point sizing and alpha for the data density
  - Chromosome labels properly centered at midpoints
  - Clean title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis chromosome labels 19-22 are slightly crowded; consider rotating or using
    abbreviated labels
  - Could highlight or label top significant SNPs as noted in spec
