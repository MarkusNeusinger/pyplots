review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal Style class for comprehensive visual customization including
    fonts, colors, and stroke widths
  - Creative implementation of real-time visualization concept with highlighted current
    value indicator (last 3 points)
  - Warning threshold dashed line provides meaningful context for the monitoring scenario
  - Realistic CPU usage data with trends, noise, and load spikes
  - Proper canvas sizing (4800x2700) with appropriately scaled font sizes
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for maximum flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text truncation (Warning Thresh...) needs fix - either shorten label or
    adjust legend_box_size/truncate_label settings
  - Missing visual indication of scrolling direction as suggested in spec (fade effect
    or arrow on trailing edge)
  - Data could include at least one spike that crosses the 80% warning threshold to
    better demonstrate the feature
