review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent faceted design effectively simulates range selector concept in a static
    plot
  - Clear visual distinction between main view and overview with highlighted selection
    region
  - Professional styling with proper text sizes, subtle grid, and clean color scheme
  - Realistic stock data with varied market conditions (trends, volatility clusters)
  - Proper use of geom_ribbon with dynamic y_min per panel for optimal fill
  weaknesses:
  - The Selected Timeframe annotation label is not visible in the final output (may
    have been obscured or positioned incorrectly)
  - 'Minor: Could benefit from slightly more prominent boundary lines or handles on
    the selection region'
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stock area chart with range selector functionality
    implemented via two faceted panels. The top panel shows the "Selected Range: Apr-Oct
    2023 (6M)" with a filled blue area chart (#306998 with alpha) showing stock price
    movements between approximately $180-$260. The bottom panel shows "Range Selector
    · Full History" displaying approximately 2 years of trading data (Jan 2022 - Jan
    2024) with the selected 6-month range highlighted by a light blue shaded rectangle
    and dashed vertical boundary lines. Both panels use the same blue color scheme
    with semi-transparent fills below the price line and solid blue lines on top.
    The Y-axis shows "Stock Price (USD)" with dollar-formatted labels ($120-$260 range),
    and the X-axis shows "Date" with monthly labels at 45-degree angles. The title
    correctly follows the format "area-stock-range · plotnine · pyplots.ai".'
