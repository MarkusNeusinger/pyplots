review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling through conditional opacity highlighting top-revenue
    companies and text annotations
  - Warm color progression palette (Python Blue to amber to orange) that visually
    maps to startup growth stages
  - 'Strong visual refinement: subtle dashed grid, removed axis lines, white bubble
    strokes, light background'
  - Realistic tech startup scenario with stage-dependent data generation creating
    natural clustering
  - Highly idiomatic Altair code with declarative encoding, layer composition, and
    proper use of Scale/Legend objects
  weaknesses:
  - Layout could be slightly tighter — right-side legends create minor asymmetry with
    some unused space
  - Feature coverage could include a few more edge cases (e.g., a high-funded low-revenue
    outlier) to demonstrate all bubble chart dynamics
  improvements: []
  verdict: APPROVED
  image_description: 'The plot displays a bubble chart titled "bubble-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai" with subtitle "Tech Startup Metrics — Funding vs Revenue by Stage
    & Team Size". The x-axis shows "Funding ($M)" ranging from 0 to 84, and the y-axis
    shows "Revenue ($M)" ranging from 0 to 110. There are 40 bubbles colored by four
    startup stages: Seed (steel blue, #306998), Series A (light blue, #4B8BBE), Series
    B (golden amber, #E8A838), and Growth (burnt orange, #D35F2D). Bubble sizes represent
    employee count with a legend showing 50, 200, 500, and 900 employees. Three top-revenue
    companies are annotated with labels (e.g., "Growth · $76.3M"). The background
    is a light gray (#fafbfc), grid lines are dashed and subtle. Smaller seed-stage
    bubbles cluster in the lower-left, with larger growth-stage bubbles in the upper-right,
    showing a clear positive correlation between funding and revenue. The Stage and
    Employees legends are positioned on the right side.'
