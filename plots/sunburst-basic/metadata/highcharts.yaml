review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts sunburst module with proper parent-child ID references
  - Well-configured level-specific styling with brightness variations for visual hierarchy
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/purple) with good contrast
  - Smart label filtering on small segments prevents overlap
  - Realistic budget allocation scenario that effectively demonstrates hierarchical
    data
  - Clean code structure following library best practices
  weaknesses:
  - Some outer ring labels are difficult to read due to segment size and rotation
    angle
  - Could improve tooltip visibility documentation in code comments
  image_description: 'The sunburst chart displays a hierarchical budget allocation
    across three concentric rings. The innermost ring shows three departments: Engineering
    (deep blue, ~55% of total), Marketing (golden yellow, ~25%), and Operations (purple,
    ~20%). The middle ring shows teams within each department with brightness variations
    of the parent color. The outer ring displays individual projects as the finest
    granularity. The title "sunburst-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top with a subtitle "Budget Allocation by Department, Team, and Project". Labels
    use circular rotation and white text with outline for readability. Colors are
    distinct and colorblind-friendly (blue/yellow/purple palette).'
