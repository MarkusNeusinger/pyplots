review:
  strengths:
  - Creative use of pygal XY chart to represent network graph despite pygal lacking
    native network support
  - Excellent force-directed layout algorithm implementation that clearly separates
    communities
  - Good color scheme with four distinct, colorblind-safe community colors
  - Interactive tooltips showing person name and connection count in SVG/HTML output
  - Clean code structure with well-commented sections
  weaknesses:
  - 'Title format incorrect: should be "network-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" not "Social
    Network · network-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai"'
  - Network layout has diagonal bias leaving upper-right and lower-left corners mostly
    empty
