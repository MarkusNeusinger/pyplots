review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of polar projection for cyclical monthly data
  - Clear visual distinction between two temperature series with contrasting colors
    and marker shapes
  - Good use of filled areas to enhance visual comparison
  - Proper clockwise month arrangement starting from January at top
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  - Realistic and educational data scenario (coastal vs inland temperature patterns)
  - Appropriate radial axis labels with temperature units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not use seaborn plotting functions (only styling utilities); implementation
    relies entirely on matplotlib for actual plotting
  - Legend placement causes overlap with title area
