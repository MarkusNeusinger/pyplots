review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all spec requirements including R², regression equation,
    and confidence interval
  - Clean manual calculation of regression statistics allows displaying R² (which
    Altair transform_regression does not provide)
  - Professional color scheme with Python blue (#306998) and contrasting yellow (#FFD43B)
  - Well-structured layered chart with proper ordering (band → line → scatter → annotation)
  - Appropriate point size and transparency for 80 data points
  - Realistic business context (advertising vs sales) that is immediately comprehensible
  weaknesses:
  - Could use Altair built-in transform_regression() for the regression line and band,
    though this would lose the ability to display R² and equation
