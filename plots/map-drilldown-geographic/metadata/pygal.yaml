review:
  strengths:
  - Colorblind-friendly palette with distinct colors for each tier
  - Correct title format matching spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
  - Comprehensive hierarchical data structure covering 5 countries, their states,
    and cities
  - Interactive HTML version provides full drill-down functionality with breadcrumb
    navigation
  - Clean visual presentation with good contrast between highlighted and non-highlighted
    countries
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of following KISS structure (imports → data
    → plot → save)
  - Sub-level drill-downs use bar charts instead of geographic maps (pygal limitation)
  - Static PNG only shows world level - the drill-down capability is only visible
    in the HTML output
  - Legend text click to drill is misleading for the static PNG output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map choropleth showing sales data
    for 5 countries: United States (dark blue, $1B+), Japan (orange, $500M-$1B), Germany
    and Brazil (teal, $300M-$500M), and Australia (purple, <$300M). The title "map-drilldown-geographic
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend at the bottom shows four sales
    tiers with corresponding colors. Below the legend is a breadcrumb hint: "World
    > Click any country to drill down to states/provinces". The map uses clean white
    background with gray country borders, and highlighted countries stand out clearly
    against the non-highlighted gray regions.'
