review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with four distinct distributions showcasing different aspects
    (tight, wide, outlier, bimodal)
  - Proper seaborn API usage with hue parameter for palette compatibility (0.14+)
  - Dark strip point colors provide good contrast against lighter box fills
  - Clean layering of boxplot (fliersize=0) with stripplot for combined visualization
  - Appropriate jitter and transparency settings prevent point overlap
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis lower limit at 0.5 creates extra whitespace below the data (1.8 is lowest
    point)
