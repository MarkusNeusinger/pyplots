review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive implementation of all spec requirements including efficient frontier
    curve, random portfolios, key portfolio markers, and capital market line
  - Excellent data generation approach using Monte Carlo simulation with binning to
    extract the efficient frontier
  - Good use of Viridis colormap for Sharpe ratio visualization
  - Clean hover templates providing detailed information on hover
  - Proper title format and clear axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Legend marker for Random Portfolios shows a single color instead of indicating
    the color scale variation
  - Could benefit from slightly larger marker sizes given the canvas size for better
    visibility at lower densities
  - The efficient frontier line appears somewhat thick relative to the data density,
    could be slightly refined
  image_description: 'The plot displays an efficient frontier visualization for portfolio
    optimization. The X-axis shows "Risk (Standard Deviation)" ranging from 0% to
    35%, and the Y-axis shows "Expected Return (Annual)" from 0% to 25%. Random portfolios
    are shown as scatter points colored by Sharpe ratio using the Viridis colormap
    (purple to yellow gradient), with a colorbar on the right indicating Sharpe Ratio
    values from ~0.43 to ~0.55. The efficient frontier is displayed as a thick yellow/gold
    curved line running through the upper-left envelope of the portfolio cloud. A
    dashed blue Capital Market Line extends from the risk-free rate point (3% at 0
    risk) through the optimal tangency point. Key portfolios are marked: a red diamond
    for "Min Variance" portfolio (~15% risk, ~10% return), and a cyan star for "Max
    Sharpe" portfolio (~18% risk, ~14% return). The legend is positioned in the upper-left
    corner with a semi-transparent background. The title correctly uses the format
    "frontier-efficient · plotly · pyplots.ai".'
