review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with no unnecessary complexity
  - Excellent use of pygal half_pie feature to create semicircular parliament-style
    visualization
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good visual distinction between parties
  - Informative title including total seats and majority threshold
  - Good font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Does not render individual seats as dots/markers - spec explicitly requires individual
    seats rendered as dots or small segments arranged in concentric arcs, but implementation
    shows proportional pie segments instead
  - Majority threshold mentioned in title only - no visual line or marker showing
    the 50%+1 threshold on the chart
  - Large whitespace gap between chart and legend at bottom reduces visual cohesion
