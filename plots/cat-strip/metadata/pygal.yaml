review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent jitter implementation using XY chart with calculated x-positions
  - Clean, professional color scheme with four distinct, accessible colors
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Realistic business context (department performance scores)
  - Good distribution variation showing different spreads and an outlier
  - Well-configured custom Style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Performance Score (%)" if percentages)
  - Grid could be slightly more subtle (current alpha via style is acceptable but
    could improve)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical strip plot showing performance
    scores (y-axis, ranging from 40-100) across four departments (x-axis: Sales, Engineering,
    Marketing, Support). Each department''s data points are shown as colored dots
    with horizontal jitter to prevent overlap: Sales in blue (#306998), Engineering
    in yellow (#FFD43B), Marketing in green (#4CAF50), and Support in pink (#E91E63).
    The title "cat-strip · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The plot has a
    clean white background with subtle horizontal grid lines. A legend at the bottom
    identifies each department by color. The y-axis is labeled "Performance Score"
    and x-axis is labeled "Department". Each category has approximately 25 data points
    showing varied distributions - Marketing shows the widest spread including an
    outlier around 40, while Engineering shows a tighter cluster around 80-90.'

        comment: Uses XY chart, custom Style, legend_at_bottom, x_value_formatter
          for category labels. Good use of pygal but no advanced SVG interactivity
          or animations.
  verdict: APPROVED
