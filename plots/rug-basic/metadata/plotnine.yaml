review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing three distinct clusters plus outliers, perfectly
    demonstrating rug plot capabilities
  - Clean, minimal theme that lets the data speak - appropriate removal of y-axis
    elements
  - Correct title format and proper axis labeling with units
  - Good use of alpha transparency (0.7) for overlapping tick marks
  - Realistic response time scenario that makes the visualization meaningful
  weaknesses:
  - Rug tick marks could be slightly more prominent (larger size) to better utilize
    the high-resolution canvas
  - Large empty space above the rug is inherent to standalone rug plots but creates
    an unbalanced visual
