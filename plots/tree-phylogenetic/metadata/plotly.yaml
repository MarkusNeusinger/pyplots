review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly annotation system with arrows to label taxonomic clades
  - Scientifically accurate primate phylogeny with correct topology and plausible
    branch lengths
  - Clean rectangular phylogram layout with proportional branch lengths
  - Scale bar with proper units enhances scientific communication
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing species name and evolutionary distance
  - Appropriate colorblind-safe color scheme (Python blue/yellow)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines extend into the tree area which could be cleaner
  - No legend present, though this is standard for phylogenetic trees
