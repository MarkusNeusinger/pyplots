review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical color scheme with consistent lighter shades for child levels
  - Clean visual separation between levels using white strokes
  - Proper tooltips showing Department, Team, Project, and Budget values
  - Well-structured data representing realistic company budget scenario
  - Inner segment labels are bold and readable
  - Proper use of Altair layering to combine multiple arc charts
  weaknesses:
  - Labels only appear on innermost ring; middle and outer rings lack visible text
    labels (rely on hover tooltips)
  - Legend positioned far from chart, creating visual imbalance
  - Could benefit from more interactive features like click-to-zoom that Altair supports
