review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with all font sizes explicitly configured for 4800x2700
    output
  - Clean idiomatic lets-plot grammar-of-graphics code with proper KISS structure
  - Good data context with realistic product sales scenario and value labels formatted
    as currency
  - Smart use of label_format for dollar-formatted value annotations
  - Removal of vertical grid lines for a cleaner bar chart presentation
  weaknesses:
  - 'No data storytelling: sorted bars are helpful but lack annotations highlighting
    key comparisons or insights (e.g., percentage differences, a highlighted leader
    bar)'
  - Aesthetic sophistication is at well-configured default level — consider adding
    subtle color gradation, edge highlighting, or a more distinctive visual identity
  - Y-axis limit of 55000 creates unnecessary whitespace above the tallest bar at
    45200 — tighter limits would improve canvas utilization
  - Monotonically decreasing data misses opportunity to show categories with similar
    values for richer comparison
  - Limited use of lets-plot distinctive features — could leverage library-specific
    capabilities more creatively
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing product sales
    across 6 categories: Electronics ($45,200), Clothing ($32,800), Home & Garden
    ($28,500), Sports ($21,300), Books ($18,900), and Toys ($15,600). All bars are
    filled with Python Blue (#306998) and arranged in descending order. Dollar-formatted
    value labels sit above each bar. The y-axis is labeled "Sales ($)" with tick marks
    at $0K–$50K increments of $10K. The x-axis is labeled "Product Category" with
    category names rotated 45 degrees. The title "bar-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The background uses a minimal theme with only horizontal
    grid lines (vertical grid lines removed). The overall canvas is landscape (4800×2700
    px).'

        comment: Uses label_format and position_nudge which are somewhat lets-plot-specific,

          changes.
