review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hive plot concept using seaborn scatterplot and lineplot
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/teal) with good visual distinction
  - Appropriate use of edge transparency (alpha=0.25) for visual bundling effect
  - Well-structured data model with realistic software dependency scenario
  - Proper use of Bezier curves for smooth edge rendering through center control point
  - Good axis label positioning at 1.2x radius for clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Bottom portion of canvas has significant whitespace due to asymmetric axis placement
  - Title has two lines which deviates slightly from single-line standard format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a hive plot visualization for software dependencies
    with three radial axes arranged at 120-degree intervals. The CORE axis (blue/navy
    color #306998) extends upward from the center, with 10 circular nodes arranged
    along it. The UTILITY axis (yellow/gold color #FFD43B) extends to the lower-left,
    also with 10 nodes. The INTERFACE axis (teal/cyan color #4ECDC4) extends to the
    lower-right with 10 nodes. Gray curved edges connect nodes between axes, showing
    dependency relationships. The edges have low alpha (transparency) for bundling
    effect. The title "Software Dependencies / hive-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top. A legend in the upper-right shows the three module types.
    The plot uses a white background with the axes off, creating a clean radial network
    visualization.'

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot and sns.lineplot for plotting, sns.set_theme
          for styling; however the Bezier curve calculation and radial positioning
          are done manually rather than leveraging any specialized seaborn features
  verdict: APPROVED
