review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, professional appearance with excellent text legibility at all sizes
  - Correct implementation of categorical counting from raw data with proper sorting
  - Good use of value labels above bars for quick reading
  - Appropriate color scheme and bar styling with borders
  - Follows KISS code structure with proper reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage Plotly-specific features like custom hover templates to enhance
    interactivity
  - Grid lines are very subtle (alpha 0.1) - could be slightly more visible for better
    readability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with 6 blue bars representing
    fruit category frequencies. The title "bar-categorical · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Fruit Category" showing categories:
    Apple (130), Banana (93), Orange (86), Grape (78), Mango (58), and Strawberry
    (55). The y-axis is labeled "Count (Frequency)" ranging from 0 to 120+. Each bar
    has its count value displayed above it. The bars are a solid blue color (#306998)
    with darker blue borders. The background is white with subtle horizontal grid
    lines. The layout is clean with good spacing between bars.'
