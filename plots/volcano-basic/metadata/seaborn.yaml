review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the classic volcano plot pattern with clear visual
    separation of significance categories
  - Proper threshold annotations (p=0.05, FC=2, FC=0.5) provide context for the significance
    cutoffs
  - Clean data generation with realistic bimodal distribution for differentially expressed
    genes
  - Good use of seaborn hue parameter with custom palette matching the specification
    colors
  - Sorting mechanism ensures significant points are plotted on top and remain visible
  weaknesses:
  - Color palette could be more colorblind-friendly (consider using blue-orange instead
    of blue-red)
  - Missing optional gene labels for top significant features mentioned in the spec
