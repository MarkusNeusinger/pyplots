review:
  strengths:
  - Correct bubble chart implementation with three data dimensions clearly represented
  - Excellent title and subtitle formatting with bubble size explanation
  - Good use of transparency (0.6 opacity) for handling overlapping bubbles
  - Realistic tech company comparison scenario with sensible data ranges
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good use of Highcharts tooltip with custom HTML formatting showing all three data
    values
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis tick labels are very dense (every 10 units from 0-660), could use larger
    intervals
  - Bubble size legend appears to be cut off or not fully visible at the bottom
  - No categorical color dimension shown (optional per spec but would enhance demonstration)
