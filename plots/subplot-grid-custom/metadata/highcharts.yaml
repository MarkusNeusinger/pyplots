review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent custom grid layout using CSS grid with main chart spanning 2 rows (colspan
    equivalent)
  - Colorblind-safe color palette using Python-themed blue/yellow and complementary
    cyan/purple
  - Realistic financial dashboard scenario with coherent related data (stock price,
    volume, sector analysis)
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Clean inline Highcharts JS approach for reliable headless rendering
  - Good use of data labels on scatter plot for sector identification
  weaknesses:
  - Missing histogram chart that was defined in code (histogram_chart_config created
    but not rendered, scatter used instead)
  - Text sizes slightly small for 4800x2700 resolution - titles should be 40px+ for
    optimal readability
  - No legend on any chart (acceptable for dashboard but spec shows supporting detail
    views)
  - Only 3 subplots when spec example suggests 5+ cells (one 2x2 main + four 1x1 detail
    views)
