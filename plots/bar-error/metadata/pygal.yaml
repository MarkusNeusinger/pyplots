review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native confidence interval (ci) feature for error bars
    with caps
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate font scaling for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Well-chosen scientific context (treatment comparison) that matches spec applications
  - Proper title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent visual appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement at bottom-left corner appears disconnected from the chart
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently dotted but still prominent)
  - Only symmetric error bars shown when spec mentions asymmetric as an option
