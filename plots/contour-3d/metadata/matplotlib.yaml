review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of matplotlib 3D capabilities with surface, 3D contours, and projected
    base contours
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principle
  - Colorblind-safe viridis colormap with appropriate alpha transparency
  - Good view angle selection (elev=30, azim=45) for 3D visualization
  - All specification requirements met including colorbar and contour projection to
    base plane
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be more specific like Position (units) if applicable)
  - Data is a generic mathematical function rather than a domain-specific real-world
    scenario
  image_description: The plot displays a 3D contour visualization rendered in matplotlib.
    It shows a semi-transparent surface in the viridis colormap (purple to yellow
    gradient) with peaks and valleys representing a mathematical function. The surface
    contains two prominent peaks - one main peak reaching amplitude ~3 (yellow) and
    a smaller secondary peak. Contour lines are drawn directly on the surface in 12
    levels using the same viridis colormap. Additionally, contour lines are projected
    onto the base plane (z ≈ -2.3), showing the level curves from a top-down view.
    The axes are labeled "X Position", "Y Position", and "Amplitude" with clear tick
    marks. The title follows the correct format "contour-3d · matplotlib · pyplots.ai".
    A vertical colorbar on the right indicates the amplitude scale from -2 to 3. The
    view angle is set at elevation 30° and azimuth 45°, providing a good perspective
    of the 3D structure.
