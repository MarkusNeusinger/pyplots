review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn statistical features (error bars showing standard deviation)
  - Clean annotation formatting that simulates tooltip data display
  - Color intensity encodes value magnitude (darker = higher)
  - Professional styling with despined axes and subtle grid
  - Good canvas utilization and readable text sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Missing legend to explain the color intensity encoding
  - Seaborn cannot provide true hover/click interactivity - the spec notes this is
    best suited for interactive libraries
  - Annotations are static and do not respond to user interaction
  - No visual feedback mechanism for hover states
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing sales revenue
    by product category. Six categories are shown (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden,
    Sports, Books, Toys) with bars colored using a sequential blue palette where darker
    shades represent higher values. Each bar includes error bars showing standard
    deviation and text annotations above displaying the mean value ± standard deviation
    and percentage of total (e.g., "5,024±281 (31.3%)"). The title correctly uses
    the format "bar-interactive · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axis labels are descriptive
    ("Product Category", "Sales Revenue ($)"). The layout is clean with despined axes,
    subtle y-axis grid lines, and good use of canvas space.

        comment: Uses seaborn's statistical aggregation with errorbar='sd' and capsize,
          sequential palette, despine(). However, seaborn fundamentally cannot provide
          interactivity which is the core spec requirement.
