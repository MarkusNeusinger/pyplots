review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of split violin using transform_density with signed density
    calculation
  - Clean faceted layout that scales well across departments
  - Includes quartile markers (IQR rule + median diamond) as suggested in spec
  - Colorblind-friendly blue/yellow palette with good contrast
  - Realistic data scenario with varying treatment effects per department
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear at default opacity rather than subtle (alpha 0.2-0.4)
  - The IQR and median markers use xOffset which places them slightly offset from
    violin center rather than overlaid on the violin halves
  image_description: 'The plot displays a split violin visualization across 4 faceted
    panels (Engineering, HR, Marketing, Sales). Each panel shows two distributions
    side-by-side within split violins: Control group (blue, #306998) on the left half
    and Treatment group (yellow, #FFD43B) on the right half. The violins meet at the
    center line and include inner IQR rules (dark vertical lines) and white diamond
    median markers. The title "violin-split · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the
    top center. A legend on the right indicates the two groups. Y-axis shows "Score
    (%)" ranging from 30-100, and each department is labeled above its respective
    panel.'

        comment: Uses transform_density, transform_calculate, faceting, layering -
          good Altair patterns but xOffset approach for IQR/median markers is somewhat
          complex
  verdict: APPROVED
