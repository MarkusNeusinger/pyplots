review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine native composition operators (| for columns, / for rows)
    to create the grid layout
  - Clean consistent color theme (blue/yellow) across all subplots
  - Good variety of plot types demonstrating subplot grid capabilities (line, bar,
    histogram, scatter)
  - Appropriate use of stat_smooth for trend lines with confidence bands
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Main figure title not visible in output - title added via fig.text() is cut off
    despite bbox_inches tight
  - Legend in line chart shows only A and B without prominent Product header
  - Some subplot titles appear truncated in rendered output
