quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design with varied distributions showcasing all box plot features
    (outliers, different spreads, different medians)
  - Clean implementation of box plot statistics with proper IQR calculations
  - Good use of Bokeh's Whisker annotation for clean whisker rendering
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800x2700 canvas with readable text
  - Correct title format and clear axis labeling
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive features (hover tooltips showing statistics
    would be valuable)
  - Axis labels lack units (could be "Test Score (points)" for clarity)
