review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of Chernoff faces with clear differentiation between
    car types
  - Well-implemented feature mappings with 7 distinct facial attributes
  - Good colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each car
  - Comprehensive legend explaining feature mappings
  - Correct title format following spec requirements
  - Clean horizontal layout with proper spacing
  - Both PNG and HTML output for flexibility
  weaknesses:
  - Color legend at bottom is redundant since car names are already labeled below
    each face
  - Some unused vertical space at the bottom of the canvas could be better utilized
  - Faces could be slightly larger to better fill the available canvas space
