review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts VennSeries with proper data structure for sets and
    intersections
  - Colorblind-safe palette (Python blue, yellow, purple) with good transparency in
    overlaps
  - Realistic, relatable data scenario (developer skill distribution)
  - Clean data labels showing both set names and values in each region
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Good canvas utilization with the diagram filling most of the space
  weaknesses:
  - Legend does not explicitly map colors to set names (Highcharts Venn limitation)
  - Very slight bottom edge clipping visible in the image
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-circle Venn diagram showing "Developer
    Skill Distribution (Team of 150)". The three overlapping circles represent Backend
    (blue, #306998), Frontend (yellow, #FFD43B), and DevOps (purple, #9467BD) developers.
    Each region displays labels with the set name and value: Backend: 100, Frontend:
    80, DevOps: 60. Intersection labels show Backend∩Frontend: 30, Backend∩DevOps:
    20, DevOps∩Frontend: 15, and the triple intersection Backend∩DevOps∩Frontend:
    10. The title "venn-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a
    subtitle. The diagram fills the canvas well with good proportions. Colors show
    transparency in overlapping regions.'
