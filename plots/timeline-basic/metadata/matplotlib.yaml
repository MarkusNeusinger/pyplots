review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent alternating label placement above/below axis eliminates text overlap
  - Clean visual design with white label boxes bordered by category colors
  - Appropriate use of matplotlib.dates for professional date formatting
  - Well-chosen colorblind-safe palette with good contrast
  - KISS code structure that is easy to read and maintain
  weaknesses:
  - Timeline lacks axis labels - a descriptive label like Project Timeline could enhance
    clarity
  - Event spacing is relatively uniform - could demonstrate more varied intervals
    between milestones
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal timeline showing 8 software project
    milestones spanning from January 2024 to December 2024. Events are represented
    as colored circular markers connected to a central gray horizontal axis line by
    vertical stems. Labels alternate above and below the axis to prevent overlap,
    with each label in a white rounded box bordered by the category color. The title
    "timeline-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.
    A legend in the upper right shows four project phases: Planning (blue), Development
    (yellow), Testing (teal), and Release (coral). Date labels (e.g., "Jan 15", "Mar
    01") appear near each marker, and the x-axis shows month/year labels from Jan
    2024 to Jan 2025.'
