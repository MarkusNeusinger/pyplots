review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data storytelling through marker size hierarchy (near-term items are
    visually bolder)
  - Smart label placement strategy with alternating inward/outward offsets in crowded
    inner rings
  - Subtle layered visual design with ring fills, sector-colored overlays, and dashed
    boundaries
  - Strong use of Bokeh-specific features (HoverTool, ColumnDataSource, dual PNG+HTML
    export)
  - Comprehensive, realistic technology dataset with plausible time-horizon assignments
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label crowding in the Adopt ring where multiple items cluster (RAG Pipelines
    / LLM Agents / K8s GitOps area)
  - Legend positioned somewhat isolated in the upper-right corner rather than integrated
    with the chart
  image_description: 'The plot displays a three-quarter circle (270°) innovation radar
    chart on a 3600×3600 square canvas with a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. Four
    concentric rings represent time horizons: Adopt (innermost, light blue fill),
    Trial (light gray fill), Assess (peach fill), and Hold (outermost, pink fill).
    Each ring has subtle dashed gray boundary arcs. Four sectors divide the angular
    space: AI & ML (top-right, blue #306998), Cloud & Infra (left, orange #E07B39),
    Sustainability (bottom-left, teal #2A9D8F), and Biotech (bottom, purple #7B2D8E).
    Sector headers appear in their respective colors along the outer edge. 26 technology
    items are plotted as colored circular markers with white edges, sized by ring
    (larger = near-term). Each item has a text label. Ring labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess,
    Hold) appear in the upper-right gap area with white background pills. A legend
    in the top-right maps colors to sectors. The title "radar-innovation-timeline
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Sector-colored overlays at very
    low alpha subtly tint each ring-sector cell.'
