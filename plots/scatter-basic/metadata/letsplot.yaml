review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent visual polish with publication-ready aesthetics: custom color palette,
    edge-highlighted markers, subtle grid, and unified background'
  - Strong data storytelling with correlation annotation, outlier callout, trend line
    with confidence band, and explanatory caption
  - Idiomatic lets-plot usage with layer_tooltips() for interactive HTML output alongside
    static PNG
  - Realistic educational scenario with thoughtful data generation including dense
    clusters and outliers
  - All font sizes explicitly set for consistent readability at the target resolution
  weaknesses:
  - Point markers could be slightly larger (size 6-7) for better visibility at 130
    data points
  - The r=0.89 annotation placement at (8.3, 38) is in a relatively empty area but
    disconnected from the trend line it describes
  - Annotation DataFrames for geom_text are verbose — each requires a separate DataFrame
    construction
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot of Study Hours (x-axis, ranging
    from ~1 to 10 hrs) versus Exam Score (y-axis, ranging from ~28 to 106 points)
    on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. Blue filled circles with white edge strokes
    (shape 21) are scattered across the plot showing a clear positive linear relationship.
    An orange linear trend line runs diagonally from lower-left to upper-right, accompanied
    by a semi-transparent orange 95% confidence band. The correlation coefficient
    "r = 0.89" is displayed in monospace font in the lower-right area of the plot.
    An italic gray "outliers →" annotation appears in the upper-left portion of the
    plot, pointing toward high-score/low-study-hour data points. The title "scatter-basic
    · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed in bold at the top-left. A subtle italic
    caption "Linear trend with 95% confidence band" sits at the bottom-right. Grid
    lines are very subtle light gray with minor grid removed. Overall the plot looks
    polished and publication-ready with thoughtful color choices and clear data storytelling.

          band provide good narrative. Outlier annotation could be more precisely
