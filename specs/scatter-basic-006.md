# scatter-basic-006: 3 scatter plots

## Description
Display three scatter plots in a single figure showing three different y-series (y1, y2, y3) against a common x-axis.

## Data Structure
- x: Common x-axis values
- y1: First series of y-values
- y2: Second series of y-values
- y3: Third series of y-values

## Visual Requirements
- Three distinct scatter plots on the same axes
- Different colors for each series
- Clear legend to identify each series
- Grid for better readability
- Appropriate axis labels
- Title describing the plot

## Implementation Notes
- Use different colors to distinguish the three series
- Include a legend with descriptive labels
- Ensure proper point visibility with appropriate marker size
- Handle overlapping points gracefully with alpha transparency
