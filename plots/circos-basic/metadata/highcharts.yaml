review:
  strengths:
  - Effective use of Highcharts dependency wheel module for chord-diagram visualization
  - Colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each region
  - Realistic global trade flow scenario with appropriate data generation
  - Proper title format and well-positioned legend
  - Good canvas utilization with square aspect ratio
  - Includes both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - N. America and Mid. East labels have minor visibility issues due to positioning/overlap
    with chart elements
  - Does not implement optional inner data tracks mentioned in specification
  - Legend is relatively small compared to the chart size
