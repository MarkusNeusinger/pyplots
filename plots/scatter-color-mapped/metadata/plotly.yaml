review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap with clear colorbar labeling including units
  - Realistic geographic/temperature scenario that demonstrates the color-mapping
    concept well
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper seed for reproducibility
  - Good font sizing throughout (title 28pt, labels 22pt, ticks 18pt) for large canvas
  - White marker borders enhance point visibility against the colorful background
  - Interactive HTML output alongside PNG leverages Plotly core strength
  weaknesses:
  - Hovertemplate is good but could include more Plotly-specific features like custom
    colorbar ticks or range sliders
  - Grid alpha at 0.3 is acceptable but could be slightly more subtle (0.2) for a
    cleaner look
