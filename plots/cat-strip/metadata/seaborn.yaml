review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions across plants (tight vs variable,
    high vs low quality)
  - Proper seaborn API usage with hue parameter to avoid deprecation warning
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate jitter (0.3) and alpha (0.7) for the data density
  - Correct title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  weaknesses:
  - Does not leverage distinctive seaborn features (e.g., could overlay with boxplot
    or violin for statistical summary)
  - Color palette includes two blue shades (Plant A and Plant C) that may be confused
    at a glance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a categorical strip plot with 5 manufacturing
    plants (Plant A-E) on the x-axis and Quality Score (%) on the y-axis (range ~35-100).
    Each plant has ~25 data points shown as colored circles with horizontal jitter.
    Colors used: Plant A (blue), Plant B (yellow), Plant C (light blue), Plant D (gray),
    Plant E (brown/orange). Different distributions are visible - Plant C shows tight
    clustering around 90, Plant D shows high variability with outliers down to ~40,
    and other plants show intermediate patterns. Title format is correct: "cat-strip
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai". Subtle horizontal grid lines are present. All text is
    clearly legible.'

        comment: Uses basic stripplot without additional seaborn features like combining
          with boxplot/violin, using statistical estimation, or dodge for grouped
          data
  verdict: APPROVED
