review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of stacked areas with confidence bands using Highcharts
    areaspline and arearange series types
  - Clean professional visual appearance with good color choices and gradient fills
  - Realistic data scenario with seasonal patterns that make sense for renewable energy
  - Proper use of linkedTo to associate confidence bands with their parent series
  - Good use of Highcharts-specific features like shared tooltips crosshair and gradient
    fills
  weaknesses:
  - Legend does not explain what the confidence bands represent
  - Confidence bands for stacked series show absolute ranges rather than symmetric
    bands around each layer
  image_description: The plot displays a stacked area chart showing renewable energy
    consumption by source (Solar, Wind, Hydro) over 8 quarters from Q1 2023 to Q4
    2024. The three main series are stacked with Solar (gold/yellow) at the bottom,
    Wind (dark blue) in the middle, and Hydro (cyan/teal) at the top. Each series
    has a visible lighter-shaded confidence band extending above and below the main
    area. The areas use smooth spline interpolation (areaspline). The Y-axis shows
    "Energy Consumption (GWh)" ranging from 0 to approximately 115, and the X-axis
    shows "Quarter" with categorical labels for each quarter. The title follows the
    required format "area-stacked-confidence · highcharts · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle
    explaining the data as "Renewable Energy Consumption by Source (GWh) with 90%
    Confidence Bands". A legend is positioned in the top-right corner with a white
    background showing all three series (Solar, Wind, Hydro). The color palette uses
    yellow, blue, and cyan which are colorblind-friendly. Data markers with white
    borders are visible on each data point. Grid lines are subtle gray. The overall
    layout is well-balanced with the chart filling most of the canvas area.
