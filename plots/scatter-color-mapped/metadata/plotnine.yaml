review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility and perceptual
    uniformity
  - Clean grammar of graphics implementation with proper layering (ggplot + geom +
    scale + labs + theme)
  - Well-structured data with meaningful spatial temperature gradient pattern
  - Comprehensive text sizing configuration for high-resolution output (figure_size,
    element_text)
  - Professional scientific context (sensor grid temperature readings)
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some unused space on the right side due to colorbar placement
  - Marker size could be slightly larger (size=5-6) for better visibility at this
    data density
  - Temperature range could show more variation to better demonstrate the full colormap
    spectrum
