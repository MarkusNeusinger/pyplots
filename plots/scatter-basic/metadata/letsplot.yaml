review:
  strengths:
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics implementation
  - Proper use of theme_minimal() with customized text sizes for readability
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scale export for high-resolution output
  - Exports both PNG and interactive HTML versions
  - Good transparency (alpha=0.7) for revealing overlapping points
  - Subtle dashed grid lines that do not overwhelm the data
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels use generic X Value/Y Value instead of a realistic scenario (e.g.,
    Study Hours vs Exam Score)
  - Title text could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
