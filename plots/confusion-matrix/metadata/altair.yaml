review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text contrast logic using alt.condition to switch between white and
    dark text based on cell value
  - Clean declarative Altair style with proper encoding types (:N, :Q)
  - Well-structured long-form DataFrame transformation for Altair grammar
  - Good use of layered composition (heatmap + text)
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for confusion matrix
  - White cell borders enhance visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing interactive tooltips which are a distinctive Altair feature
  - Legend positioning could be optimized to be closer to the plot
