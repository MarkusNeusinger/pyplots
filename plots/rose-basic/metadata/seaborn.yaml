review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with well-chosen Blues gradient palette creating an intuitive
    rainfall theme
  - Correct implementation of rose chart starting at 12 o'clock (top) and proceeding
    clockwise
  - Value labels on each bar aid precise reading without cluttering the visualization
  - Proper use of polar projection with radius proportional to value (not area)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Radial gridlines with units (mm) help users estimate values
  weaknesses:
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features; primarily relies on matplotlib for the
    polar bar chart with only sns.color_palette used
  - Grid legend explaining the color gradient is missing (though arguably not needed
    for single-series data)
  - Corner whitespace in square format is unavoidable but slightly reduces canvas
    efficiency
