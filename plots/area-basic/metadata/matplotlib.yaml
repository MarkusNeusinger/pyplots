review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent adherence to spec requirements: semi-transparent fill, gridlines, clear
    labels'
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Perfect title format and appropriate font sizing throughout
  - Realistic website visitor data with natural trend and variation
  - Good use of fill_between with matching line plot on top
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels missing units (e.g., Daily Visitors could include count)
  - Did not implement optional gradient fill from bottom to line for visual appeal
  - Basic matplotlib usage without leveraging distinctive features
