review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent realistic data context using human heights with proper statistical parameters
    (mean=170, sd=10)
  - Clean KISS code structure following all guidelines
  - Proper use of quad glyphs for histogram bars with no gaps between bins
  - Correct title format and axis labels with units
  - Good visual styling with appropriate font sizes for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Y-axis correctly starts at zero as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Could add HoverTool to display bin range and count on hover, leveraging Bokeh
    interactivity
  - Data shows only a perfect normal distribution; adding slight skewness or a few
    outliers would better demonstrate histogram capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a histogram showing the distribution of human
    heights in centimeters. The bars are rendered in a muted blue color (#306998)
    with white borders and 0.8 alpha transparency. The distribution follows a clear
    bell curve (normal distribution) centered around 170 cm, ranging from approximately
    135 cm to 210 cm. The peak frequency is around 58 observations. The title "histogram-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner. The x-axis is labeled "Height
    (cm)" and the y-axis "Frequency". Dashed grid lines are visible at alpha 0.3.
    The Y-axis correctly starts at 0. The bars have no gaps between them, showing
    proper histogram bin edges.
