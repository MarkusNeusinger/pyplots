review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent diverging color scheme using Python brand colors (blue/yellow) that
    is colorblind-safe
  - Clear value annotations in each cell make exact values easy to read
  - Well-structured data with meaningful trend pattern showing performance improvement
    over time
  - Clean use of plotnine grammar of graphics with proper layering (geom_tile + geom_text)
  - Correct categorical ordering preserves temporal sequence on x-axis and intuitive
    top-to-bottom region ordering
  - Title follows exact specification format
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units or additional context (e.g., Value could specify Performance
    Index or similar)
  - Cell annotation text color is always black, which reduces contrast on darker blue
    cells (e.g., Region G, Q1 2023 at -45.4)
  image_description: The heatmap displays an 8x8 matrix showing performance metrics
    across 8 regions (A-H on the y-axis) and 8 time periods (Q1 2023 through Q4 2024
    on the x-axis). The color scheme uses a diverging palette with Python Blue (#306998)
    for negative values and Python Yellow (#FFD43B) for positive values, with white
    at the midpoint (0). Each cell contains its numerical value as a text annotation.
    The colorbar legend on the right shows the "Value" scale ranging from approximately
    -25 to +25. The title "heatmap-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
    The plot clearly shows a trend pattern where earlier quarters have predominantly
    negative values (blue) and later quarters show positive values (yellow), demonstrating
    regional performance improvement over time.

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_tile + geom_text layering, but
          scale_fill_gradient2 is basic; could leverage faceting or more advanced
          theming
  verdict: APPROVED
