review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent grid layout organizing faces by species with clear row and column labels
  - Outstanding feature mapping legend explaining what each facial feature represents
  - Good use of colorblind-friendly palette (blue, yellow, green) to distinguish species
  - Proper data normalization (0-1) before mapping to facial features
  - Includes both PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging Plotly interactivity
  - All facial features (face shape, eyes, pupils, eyebrows, nose, mouth) are clearly
    rendered
  - Title follows correct format with spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
  weaknesses:
  - Within-species facial variation is subtle, especially for Setosa - faces look
    very similar within each row making it hard to see individual differences
  - Title includes Iris Dataset prefix which deviates slightly from the pure spec-id
    format
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3x5 grid of 15 Chernoff faces representing
    the Iris dataset. Each row corresponds to a species (Setosa in blue, Versicolor
    in yellow, Virginica in green), with 5 samples per species. Each face has elliptical
    shape with eyes (white with black pupils), eyebrows, a triangular nose, and a
    curved mouth. The title reads "Iris Dataset · chernoff-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    at the top. A species legend is positioned in the upper right, and a "Feature
    Mapping" box on the right side explains: Face Width → Sepal Length, Face Height
    → Sepal Width, Eye Size → Petal Length, Smile → Petal Width. Row labels (Setosa,
    Versicolor, Virginica) are on the left, and column labels (Sample 1-5) are at
    the top of each column.'
