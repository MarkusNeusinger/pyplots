review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent signal processing implementation with proper FFT computation and normalization
  - Clear visualization of frequency peaks with effective use of annotations and vertical
    reference lines
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes meeting 4800×2700 resolution
    requirements
  - dB scale properly implemented with floor to avoid log(0)
  - Fill under curve provides good visual emphasis of the spectrum shape
  weaknesses:
  - Line width (2.5) could be increased to 3 for better visibility at full resolution
  - No legend present, though for this single-series plot it is acceptable
  - Could use more distinctive matplotlib features like spine customization or logarithmic
    frequency scale option
  image_description: The plot displays a frequency spectrum with amplitude (dB) on
    the Y-axis ranging from -60 to 10, and frequency (Hz) on the X-axis ranging from
    0 to 300. The spectrum line is rendered in a blue color (#306998) with a semi-transparent
    fill beneath the curve. Three prominent peaks are clearly visible at 50 Hz, 120
    Hz, and 200 Hz, each marked with yellow circular markers and annotated with their
    frequency values. Vertical yellow dashed lines highlight each peak frequency.
    The noise floor fluctuates around -40 to -50 dB. The title follows the correct
    format "spectrum-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai". The overall layout is clean
    with balanced margins and a subtle grid.

        comment: Uses standard matplotlib features (plot, fill_between, scatter, annotate,
          axvline). Could leverage more advanced features like twin axes or custom
          tick formatting
  verdict: APPROVED
