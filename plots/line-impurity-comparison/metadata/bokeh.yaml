review:
  strengths:
  - Shaded area between curves is an excellent visual storytelling technique that
    immediately communicates the difference between the two metrics
  - All spec features implemented including formula legends, max annotations, edge
    case handling, and grid
  - 'Expert use of Bokeh-specific features: HoverTool, click_policy=hide, Span, dual
    PNG+HTML export'
  - Educational annotations (value labels, insight box) transform this from a raw
    plot into a learning resource
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with deterministic data
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (dimensionless quantities, but normalized to [0,1] or similar
    could help)
  - The insight annotation box near the bottom-right is slightly heavy-handed and
    could be more subtly integrated
  image_description: The plot displays two smooth curves on a light gray (#f8f8f8)
    background comparing Gini impurity and entropy as decision tree splitting criteria.
    A solid blue (#306998) line represents Gini impurity (2p(1-p)) peaking at 0.5,
    and a dashed amber/gold (#D4A017) line represents entropy (-p log2(p) - (1-p)
    log2(1-p)) peaking at 1.0. The area between the two curves is filled with a subtle
    amber shading, visually emphasizing their difference. Both curves start at (0,
    0) and end at (1, 0) with maxima at p=0.5, marked by large dots (blue at 0.5,
    amber at 1.0) connected by a dotted vertical segment. A vertical dotted reference
    line sits at p=0.5. Annotations include "p = 0.5 (maximum impurity)" with a white
    background box, "Gini max = 0.5" in blue italic, "Entropy max = 1.0" in dark amber
    italic, and an educational insight box stating "Both criteria agree on optimal
    splits → similar tree structures in practice." The legend in the top-left corner
    shows both formulas. Title reads "line-impurity-comparison · bokeh · pyplots.ai".
    Axis labels are "Probability (p)" and "Impurity Measure (normalized)". Subtle
    horizontal grid lines on the y-axis only.
