review:
  strengths:
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all required features (ECDFs, K-S statistic, max distance
    line, p-value, legend) are present and correctly implemented'
  - Excellent realistic data context using credit scoring with beta distributions
    that produce plausible score shapes
  - Clean, well-structured code with proper KISS pattern and appropriate complexity
    for the ECDF computation
  - 'Good use of matplotlib idioms: step plots, annotate with arrowprops, transAxes
    coordinate system'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Color accessibility could be improved: blue-red pair lacks line style differentiation
    (e.g., dashed vs solid) for colorblind viewers'
  - Axis label Credit Score could include scale context (e.g., Credit Score 0-100)
  - The area between the two ECDFs at the maximum distance point could be shaded or
    filled to create stronger visual storytelling
  - Design could be elevated with a light fill or shading between the two curves to
    emphasize the distributional gap
  image_description: The plot displays two empirical cumulative distribution functions
    (ECDFs) as step functions against "Credit Score" (x-axis, 0-100) and "Cumulative
    Proportion" (y-axis, 0-1.0). The blue line (#306998) represents "Good Customers"
    and the red line (#D4533B) represents "Bad Customers." A dashed vertical line
    at approximately score 50 marks the point of maximum divergence, with two dark
    dots (white-edged) at the endpoints of the distance. An annotation "D = 0.722"
    with a horizontal arrow points to the midpoint of the distance line. The p-value
    (< 0.001) is displayed in gray in the bottom-right corner. The title reads "ks-test-comparison
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. Top and right spines are removed,
    and a subtle y-axis grid is visible. The legend is in the upper-left corner. The
    two distributions are clearly separated, with Bad Customers accumulating faster
    (shifted left) compared to Good Customers.
