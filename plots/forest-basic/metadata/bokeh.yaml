review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of all forest plot elements (diamond, whiskers, reference
    line, weighted markers)
  - Realistic medical meta-analysis data with appropriate study naming conventions
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper Bokeh idioms (ColumnDataSource, Span, Label)
  - Good visual hierarchy distinguishing individual studies from pooled estimate
  - Proper use of Bokeh patch() for diamond shape
  weaknesses:
  - Right side of canvas has excessive whitespace (x_range extends to 4 but data only
    goes to ~-0.2)
  - All studies favor treatment - missing a study crossing the null line would better
    demonstrate forest plot capabilities
  - Could add HoverTool for interactivity (a Bokeh strength)
  image_description: The forest plot displays a meta-analysis of blood pressure reduction
    trials with 11 individual studies plus a pooled estimate. Each study (Smith et
    al. 2018 through Thomas et al. 2023) is represented by a blue circle (point estimate)
    with horizontal whiskers showing 95% confidence intervals and vertical end caps.
    Marker sizes vary proportionally to study weight. The pooled estimate at the bottom
    is shown as a distinctive yellow diamond. A vertical dashed gray line marks the
    null effect at 0. The x-axis shows "Mean Difference in Blood Pressure (mmHg)"
    ranging from -12 to 4. "← Favors Treatment" and "Favors Control →" labels appear
    at the bottom. All effect sizes are negative, indicating treatment benefit. The
    title "forest-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at top left.
