review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing varied distributions with meaningful outliers across
    plants
  - Clean KISS code structure following all matplotlib guidelines
  - Appropriate sizing for 4800×2700 output (s=150, alpha=0.7, proper font sizes)
  - Effective jitter implementation prevents point overlap
  - Professional manufacturing QC context is neutral and relatable
  weaknesses:
  - Legend labels are set but ax.legend() is never called, resulting in unused code
    (labels in scatter calls)
  - No distinctive matplotlib features used beyond basic scatter - could leverage
    ax.errorbar() for confidence intervals or custom marker styles
