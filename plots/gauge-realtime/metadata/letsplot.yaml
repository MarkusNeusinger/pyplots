review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of gauge chart using geom_polygon for arc segments with
    proper color zone mapping
  - Creative use of ghost needles (semi-transparent segments) to show motion blur
    effect for real-time simulation
  - Clean, professional appearance with appropriate color scheme following intuitive
    green/yellow/red convention
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles with clear data preparation
  - Proper use of coord_fixed() to maintain aspect ratio and theme_void() for clean
    gauge appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Ghost needles could be slightly more visible (higher alpha or thicker lines) to
    better convey the motion effect
  - Could benefit from using lets-plot interactive HTML features more prominently
    since it generates HTML output
  - The tick marks could be slightly more prominent for better gauge readability at
    a glance
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semi-circular gauge chart representing CPU
    usage. The gauge arc is divided into three distinct color zones: green (0-50,
    "Normal"), yellow/amber (50-80, "Warning"), and red (80-100, "Critical"). The
    arc is composed of fine radial segments with subtle white borders between them.
    A dark needle points to approximately 67%, with three semi-transparent gray "ghost"
    needles trailing behind at positions 58, 62, and 65 to create a motion blur effect
    indicating real-time updates. The needle pivot point has a dark hub with a smaller
    gray center. Tick marks with labels are positioned at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 around
    the gauge perimeter. Below the needle, the current value "67%" is prominently
    displayed in large bold dark text, with "CPU Usage" as a smaller gray label beneath
    it. The title "gauge-realtime · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The
    overall layout is clean with a white background and good use of canvas space.'
