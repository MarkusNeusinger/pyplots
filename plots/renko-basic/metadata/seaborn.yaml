review:
  strengths:
  - Correct Renko brick calculation algorithm with proper stair-step pattern
  - Good visual presentation with uniform brick sizing and gaps
  - Comprehensive annotations (legend, brick size info, clear axis labels)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate use of seaborn styling context for consistent font scaling
  weaknesses:
  - Title format uses hyphens instead of required middle-dot separator (·)
  - Seaborn used only for styling, not for actual plotting (fundamental limitation
    for this chart type)
  - Red/green color scheme is not colorblind accessible (consider using colorblind-friendly
    alternatives like blue/orange)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Renko chart with approximately 40 bricks
    showing stock price movement from around $100. Green bricks represent bullish
    (up) price movements and red bricks represent bearish (down) movements. The chart
    shows a clear downtrend from ~$104 to ~$87, followed by consolidation around $90,
    then an uptrend reaching ~$111. Bricks are uniform in size ($2) with small white-edged
    gaps between them. Title "renko-basic - seaborn - pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    in bold. A legend in the upper left shows "Bullish (Up)" in green and "Bearish
    (Down)" in red. X-axis labeled "Brick Number" (0-40), Y-axis labeled "Stock Price
    (USD)" ($85-$110). Subtle horizontal grid lines are present. An annotation box
    in the bottom right shows "Brick Size: $2".'

        comment: Seaborn only used for styling (set_style, set_context), all plotting
          via matplotlib patches. Fundamental limitation for Renko charts.
