  strengths:
  - Professional donut chart design with center annotation providing context — a signature
    Plotly technique
  - Excellent data storytelling with the AWS callout annotation and exploded slice
    drawing attention to the market leader
  - Custom colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue, with white slice borders
    for clean separation
  - 'Perfect spec compliance: all four requirements (percentages, distinct colors,
    legend, exploded slice) are present'
  - Clean, well-structured code with explicit font sizing throughout and correct output
    dimensions
  - 'Good use of Plotly-specific features: hovertemplate, donut hole, HTML export,
    domain positioning'
  weaknesses:
  - The callout annotation arrow points upward rather than directly at the AWS slice,
    weakening the visual connection between the annotation and the data it references
  - The bright yellow (Azure) slice creates a slight contrast imbalance against the
    pale off-white background
  - Legend is positioned somewhat far from the chart, creating excess whitespace in
    the right portion of the canvas
  image_description: 'The plot displays a donut chart (pie chart with center hole)
    showing cloud computing market share for 2024. Six slices represent: AWS (31%,
    dark navy blue, slightly exploded outward), Azure (24%, golden yellow), Google
    Cloud (11%, teal), Alibaba (4%, light purple), IBM (3%, coral/orange), and Others
    (27%, light blue). Percentage labels with category names are positioned outside
    each slice with connector lines. A vertical legend on the right side lists all
    six categories with colored markers. Inside the donut hole, bold blue text reads
    "Cloud Market 2024". A callout annotation box in the bottom-right corner reads
    "AWS leads with 31% market share" with an upward-pointing arrow. White borders
    (3px) separate each slice. The title "pie-basic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. The background is a subtle off-white (#FAFAFA).'
