review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of the inverse normal CDF (ppf) using Abramowitz
    & Stegun approximation, avoiding scipy dependency
  - Correct use of Blom formula for plotting positions, which is statistically appropriate
  - Good demonstration of Q-Q plot interpretation with intentionally skewed data showing
    deviation from normality
  - Proper scaling (3x scale factor) to achieve target 4800×2700 resolution
  - 'Clean visual design with Python brand colors (blue #306998, gold #FFD43B) and
    minimal theme'
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be slightly more subtle (current alpha appears around 0.5, could
    be 0.3)
  - Wildcard import from lets_plot requires multiple noqa comments
