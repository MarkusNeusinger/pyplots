review:
  strengths:
  - Perfect spec compliance — all suggested features (value labels, single color,
    consistent widths, spacing) are implemented
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle with no unnecessary complexity
  - Realistic product sales data with good value range and descending sort for clear
    ranking
  - Explicit font sizing for all text elements ensures legibility at 4800x2700
  - Good use of pygal-specific features like rounded_bars, print_values with value_formatter
  weaknesses:
  - Design lacks storytelling elements — no annotations highlighting the top performer
    or insights about the data distribution
  - Visual refinement is limited — the plot still looks like a well-configured default
    rather than a publication-quality visualization
  - Could benefit from visual emphasis techniques such as highlighting the leading
    category or adding a subtle gradient/color variation to guide the viewer attention
  - The y-axis tick labels use dollar formatting from pygal defaults but the value
    formatter only applies to bar labels — consider consistent formatting approach
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" on a white background. Six bars in a consistent muted blue (#306998)
    represent quarterly sales by product category, sorted in descending order: Electronics
    ($52,400), Clothing ($34,100), Home & Garden ($28,500), Sports ($17,600), Books
    ($11,200), and Toys ($6,800). The x-axis is labeled "Category" and the y-axis
    "Sales ($)" with dollar-formatted tick marks from $0 to $50,000. Dollar-formatted
    value labels appear above each bar. Light dotted horizontal grid lines provide
    reference. Bars have slightly rounded corners and consistent spacing. No legend
    is shown (appropriate for single-series data).'

        comment: All font sizes explicitly set (title=48, labels=40, values=34). All

          Well-configured but reads as a polished default rather than exceptional

          But overall chrome is still default pygal styling.
