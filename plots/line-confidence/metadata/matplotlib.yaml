review:
  strengths:
  - Clean KISS structure with no functions or classes
  - Excellent use of fill_between for confidence band with appropriate alpha transparency
  - Realistic temperature forecast scenario with widening uncertainty over time
  - Well-formatted title following the required spec-id · library · pyplots.ai format
  - Good legend placement and clear labeling of both central line and confidence interval
  weaknesses:
  - Could use contrasting colors for line vs band as suggested in spec (e.g., dark
    blue line with lighter blue band - currently same color)
