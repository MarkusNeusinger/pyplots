review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with smooth color transitions from 80x80 grid resolution
  - Viridis colormap is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  - Subtle white contour line overlay at 0.4 alpha helps with precise level identification
    without being distracting
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seaborn styling setup
  - Multi-peak surface with saddle region demonstrates varied contour features
  - Correct title format and well-sized text elements
  - Equal aspect ratio ensures geometric accuracy of contours
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels are generic (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) rather than having units
    or representing a specific real-world context
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features since seaborn lacks native contour functions
    - relies primarily on matplotlib for the actual contour plotting
  - Could benefit from a more application-specific scenario (e.g., topographic elevation,
    temperature field) rather than abstract mathematical function
  image_description: 'The plot shows a filled contour visualization of a 2D scalar
    field with multiple Gaussian peaks and a saddle region. The image uses the viridis
    colormap ranging from dark purple (-0.346) through blue, green to yellow (0.997).
    There are two prominent positive peaks: one in the upper-right quadrant (around
    x=1, y=1) and another in the lower-left quadrant (around x=-1, y=-1), both reaching
    yellow intensity values close to 1.0. A negative "valley" region is visible around
    x=0.5, y=-0.5 appearing in dark purple. White contour lines are overlaid at low
    opacity to show level boundaries. The colorbar is positioned on the right with
    the label "Intensity". The title follows the correct format "contour-filled ·
    seaborn · pyplots.ai". Axis labels show "X Coordinate" and "Y Coordinate". The
    plot uses equal aspect ratio, making the contours appear geometrically accurate.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme and sns.set_context for styling, and sns.color_palette
          for colormap. However, seaborn does not have native contour functions, so
          this implementation relies on matplotlib's contourf. The seaborn usage is
          limited to styling rather than core plotting functionality.
  verdict: APPROVED
