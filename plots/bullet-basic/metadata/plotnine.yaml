review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of bullet chart using plotnine grammar of graphics approach
  - Grayscale bands follow spec recommendation for keeping focus on the primary measure
    bar
  - Good data normalization approach to display metrics with different scales on a
    common percentage axis
  - Clean, well-commented code structure with clear separation of data preparation
    and plotting
  - Proper use of geom_segment for the target marker perpendicular to the bar as specified
  - Actual values displayed as text labels for precise reading as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Missing a legend or annotation explaining what the grayscale bands (Poor/Satisfactory/Good)
    represent
