review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Bokeh interactive features (BoxSelectTool, WheelZoomTool, selection
    styling)
  - Well-implemented selection visual feedback (selected points highlighted, non-selected
    dimmed to alpha 0.2)
  - Clean four-cluster dataset that effectively demonstrates brush selection capability
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource and factor_cmap
  - WebGL backend enabled for better performance
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive viewing
  - Good canvas utilization with appropriate margins
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (generic X Value, Y Value)
  - Selection count display not implemented (spec suggests showing count of selected
    points)
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for the 4800x2700 canvas
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a scatter plot with 300 data points organized into 4 distinct clusters. The title "scatter-brush-zoom · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Four clusters are visible:

    - Cluster A (blue, #306998): Located in the lower-left quadrant, centered around (20, 30)
    - Cluster B (yellow, #FFD43B): Located in the upper-right area, centered around (60, 70)
    - Cluster C (red/coral, #E74C3C): Located in the upper-left area, centered around (25, 75)
    - Cluster D (green, #2ECC71): Located in the lower-right area, centered around (70, 25)

    The legend is positioned in the top-right corner showing all four cluster labels. The X-axis is labeled "X Value" (range 0-100), and the Y-axis is labeled "Y Value" (range 0-90+). A subtle dashed grid is visible in the background. Points have white borders and good alpha transparency (0.8). The plot utilizes the full canvas well with balanced margins.
