review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed circle packing algorithm implementation that correctly
    avoids overlap
  - Proper area scaling (sqrt) for accurate visual perception as specified
  - Clean, readable labels positioned inside bubbles with dynamic font sizing
  - Rich hover templates with formatted budget values
  - Good color palette starting with Python colors
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  - Realistic department budget data with appropriate value range
  weaknesses:
  - No legend showing total budget or providing a size reference scale
  - Text in smallest bubbles (Admin, Legal, Design) appears slightly cramped
  - Optional grouping feature from spec not demonstrated (though marked optional)
  image_description: The plot displays a packed bubble chart with 15 circles representing
    department budget allocations. Each circle is labeled with the department name
    (bold) and budget value (in $M or $K format). The circles are packed tightly together
    without overlap, with the largest circles being Engineering ($4.5M), R&D ($3.8M),
    Sales ($3.2M), and Marketing ($2.8M). Smaller departments like Admin ($450K),
    Legal ($650K), and Design ($720K) appear as smaller circles. The color palette
    is diverse - Python blue for R&D, yellow for Engineering, various other colors
    including pink, orange, teal, brown, and purple. The title "Department Budget
    Allocation · bubble-packed · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in
    dark gray text. The background is clean white with no grid lines or axes shown.

        comment: All text is clearly readable. Title is large and prominent. Department
          names and values are legible inside each bubble with white text that contrasts
          well against the colored backgrounds.

        comment: 'Bubble sizes are well-proportioned to show the data differences.
          The force simulation effectively packed the circles. Minor: some smaller
          bubbles (Admin, Legal) have slightly cramped text.'

          blue and yellow featured prominently, other colors well-differentiated.

        comment: Good proportions with circles centered in the plot area. White space
          around the packed bubbles is balanced.

        comment: N/A for packed bubble chart - correctly hidden as position has no
          meaning.

        score: 0
        max: 2
        passed: true
        comment: No legend shown. While a legend isn't strictly necessary since labels
          are on bubbles, a small legend or group indicator could enhance understanding.

        comment: Uses go.Scatter with annotations for labels and hover templates for
          interactivity. The HTML export enables Plotly's interactive features. Could
          leverage Plotly's animation capabilities for the force simulation or use
          custom shapes.
  verdict: APPROVED
