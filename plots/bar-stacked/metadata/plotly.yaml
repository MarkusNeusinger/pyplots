review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing throughout with large, readable fonts at all levels
  - Clean implementation following the spec recommendation for total value labels
    above stacks
  - Well-chosen color palette with good visual distinction between categories
  - Proper use of Plotly barmode=stack and annotation features
  - Professional business context (quarterly revenue) that clearly demonstrates stacked
    bar use case
  weaknesses:
  - Legend order is inverted compared to visual stacking order (shows Support first
    instead of Software)
