review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimalist aesthetic that exemplifies the lollipop chart concept
  - Excellent color scheme with Python-themed blue/yellow that is colorblind-accessible
  - Data properly sorted by value descending for optimal readability
  - Text sizing perfectly calibrated for 4800x2700 output
  - Good use of rotated labels to prevent overlap with 10 categories
  weaknesses:
  - No random seed set (though data is deterministic)
  - Grid styling could include minor gridlines for enhanced readability
