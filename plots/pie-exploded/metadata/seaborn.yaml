review:
  strengths:
  - Clean and professional visual appearance with well-styled legend (shadow, fancybox)
  - Excellent use of seaborn theming capabilities (set_theme, set_context) for consistent
    aesthetics
  - Percentage labels are bold white text with good visibility against colored slices
  - The exploded TechCorp slice effectively draws attention to the market leader
  - Realistic market share scenario that matches the spec application examples
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate multiple exploded slices (spec says 1-3 slices can be exploded)
    to show full feature range
  - Square figsize (12, 12) may not be optimal - standard 16:9 or defined square format
    could improve canvas utilization
  - The seaborn library is primarily used for styling rather than core plotting (acceptable
    since seaborn has no native pie chart)
  image_description: 'The plot shows an exploded pie chart visualizing market share
    analysis. The chart displays 5 company segments: TechCorp (35.2%, dark blue, exploded
    outward from the center), DataSoft (22.8%, yellow), CloudNet (18.5%, teal), AIVentures
    (14.3%, coral/salmon), and CyberSys (9.2%, light mint green). All slices have
    white percentage labels with bold text inside them. The TechCorp slice is visibly
    separated from the center, emphasizing it as the market leader. A legend on the
    right side shows company names with their percentages. The title reads ''Market
    Share Analysis · pie-exploded · seaborn · pyplots.ai'' in bold at the top. The
    chart uses white edge lines between slices and has a clean white background.'
