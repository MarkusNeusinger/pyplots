review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas (42pt title, 32pt
    labels)
  - Clean separation between clusters with 15-unit gaps making visual grouping clear
  - Proper use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource pattern and Span/Label models
  - Colorblind-safe palette (blue/yellow/green) with good contrast
  - Sorted bars within clusters exactly as spec requires
  - Includes both PNG and HTML output leveraging Bokeh dual-format capability
  - Realistic customer segmentation scenario with varied cluster quality
  weaknesses:
  - Stats labels on right side (n=XX, avg=X.XX) appear relatively small compared to
    other text elements
  - Could benefit from hover tooltips showing individual sample silhouette values
    for interactivity
  - No explicit legend element though cluster labels serve the purpose adequately
