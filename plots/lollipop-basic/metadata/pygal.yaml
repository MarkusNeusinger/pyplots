review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lollipop chart using pygal XY chart with creative
    baseline dot hiding technique
  - Clean horizontal orientation that handles category labels well
  - Proper title format and color scheme following pyplots standards
  - Data sorted by value for optimal readability as recommended in spec
  - Good canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with appropriate font scaling
  weaknesses:
  - Missing y_title axis label (could add Product Category or similar)
  - Font sizes in Style could be better optimized for the large canvas
