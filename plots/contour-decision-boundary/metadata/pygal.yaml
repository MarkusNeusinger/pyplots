review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using pygal XY chart with custom SVG injection for
    decision regions
  - Clear visualization of the moon-shaped decision boundary with proper color-coded
    regions
  - Good implementation of misclassified point markers with red X overlay
  - Well-designed legend showing all three marker types
  - Colorblind-safe blue/yellow color scheme
  - Proper use of sklearn make_moons dataset for realistic ML context
  weaknesses:
  - Helper function data_to_svg() breaks KISS principle slightly, though justified
    for coordinate mapping
  - Axis labels lack units (acceptable for synthetic ML data, but Feature 1 normalized
    would be better)
