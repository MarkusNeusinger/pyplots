review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highmaps module with real Europe topology for geographic context
  - Implemented custom marching squares algorithm for contour extraction (sophisticated
    technical approach)
  - Good color progression that is colorblind-safe
  - Proper differentiation between major (1000m intervals) and minor contours via
    line width
  - Interactive HTML version also generated
  - Multiple simulated Alpine peaks showing realistic terrain patterns
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions instead of flat KISS structure (minor violation of
    code style guidelines)
  - Contour lines not labeled directly with elevation values on the lines themselves
  - Title format slightly non-standard (custom name before spec-id format)
  image_description: The plot displays a map of Europe with contour lines overlaid
    on the Alps region (centered on Switzerland, Austria, and Northern Italy). The
    background is a light blue (#f0f8ff) with land masses shown in a muted sage green
    (#d4e6c5). Country borders are visible in gray. The contour lines show elevation
    levels ranging from 500m to 3000m in 500m intervals. The contours form concentric
    nested patterns representing mountain peaks, with the highest elevations (3000m
    shown in orange) at the centers. Colors progress from green (500m) through blue
    (1000m), teal (1500m), purple (2000m), red (2500m) to orange (3000m). A vertical
    legend on the right side shows "Elevation" with color-coded line samples for each
    level. The title reads "Alpine Elevation Contours · contour-map-geographic · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the visualization. The map shows good
    geographic context with all of Europe visible, clearly identifying the Alps as
    the region of interest.
