review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent dual-pane layout with proper 70/30 split as specified
  - Shared x-range between candlestick and volume charts works perfectly
  - CrosshairTool added for both panes as requested in spec
  - Color scheme is colorblind-accessible (blue/yellow instead of red/green)
  - Volume bars correctly color-coded to match candlestick up/down days
  - Text sizes well-scaled for 4800×2700 output
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could be more subtle (current alpha 0.3 is slightly prominent)
  - Volume bar colors appear more muted compared to candlesticks - consider matching
    fill_alpha
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance Bokeh interactive capabilities
