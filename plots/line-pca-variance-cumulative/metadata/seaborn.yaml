review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent spec compliance: implements all specified features including the optional
    bar overlay for individual variance'
  - 'Strong data storytelling: the red marker and arrow annotation clearly communicate
    the 95% crossing point, making the key insight immediately visible'
  - Real dataset (Wine) provides authentic PCA results with a natural elbow curve
  - Clean white-fill markers with blue edges create a polished, professional look
  - Well-structured code that follows KISS principle with no unnecessary abstraction
  weaknesses:
  - The 95% and 90% threshold labels are positioned too close together in the upper
    left, creating slight visual crowding — consider spacing them out or moving one
    to the right side
  - The red-purple color pair for threshold lines is not the strongest for colorblind
    accessibility — consider using more perceptually distinct colors (e.g., blue-orange)
  - The custom legend, while functional, could benefit from better visual integration
    (e.g., match the marker sizes more closely to the actual plot elements)
  image_description: The plot displays a combined line-and-bar chart on a white background
    with subtle y-axis gridlines. A blue line with white-filled, blue-edged circular
    markers traces the cumulative explained variance from approximately 36% at component
    1, rising through an elbow-shaped curve to nearly 100% at component 13. Light
    blue semi-transparent bars behind the line show the individual variance contribution
    per component, decreasing from about 36% for the first component to near zero
    for components 11-13. A red dashed horizontal line marks the 95% threshold and
    a purple dash-dot line marks 90%, with bold colored labels ("95%" in red, "90%"
    in purple) placed at the left edge. A prominent red-filled dot at component 10
    highlights where cumulative variance first exceeds 95% (~96.2%), connected by
    a curved red arrow to an annotation reading "10 components (96.2%)". The title
    reads "line-pca-variance-cumulative · seaborn · pyplots.ai" in a medium-weight
    font. X-axis is labeled "Number of Principal Components", Y-axis is "Explained
    Variance (%)". A legend in the lower right identifies "Cumulative Variance" (line+marker)
    and "Individual Variance" (filled rectangle). Top and right spines are removed.
