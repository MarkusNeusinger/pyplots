review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts packedbubble chart type with proper physics simulation
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between sectors
  - Smart data label filtering to show labels only on larger bubbles (value > 230)
  - Realistic market sector data that perfectly demonstrates the packed bubble use
    case
  - Clean separation of sectors in the legend with appropriate grouping
  - Proper inline JavaScript embedding for headless Chrome rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Large whitespace around the packed bubble cluster could be reduced by adjusting
    layout parameters
  - Title includes extra descriptor which deviates slightly from the pure spec-id
    format
  - Some smaller bubbles have no visible labels even though they are part of the visualization
  image_description: 'The plot displays a packed bubble chart showing market sectors
    with circles of varying sizes representing market value in billions of dollars.
    The visualization uses 5 distinct colors: blue (Technology sector with Software,
    Hardware, Cloud Services, Semiconductors, Cybersecurity), yellow (Finance sector
    with Banking, Insurance, Asset Management, Fintech), purple (Healthcare with Pharmaceuticals,
    Medical Devices, Biotech, Healthcare Services), cyan (Energy with Oil & Gas, Renewables,
    Utilities), and brown/tan (Consumer with Retail, Food & Beverage, Automotive,
    Entertainment). The largest bubbles are Software (850B), Banking (720B), and Cloud
    Services (680B). Labels appear inside larger bubbles with white text and contrast
    outline. The title follows the correct format, subtitle explains the size encoding,
    and a legend at the bottom identifies each sector.'
