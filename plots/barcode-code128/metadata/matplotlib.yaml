review:
  strengths:
  - Comprehensive Code 128B implementation with complete encoding tables
  - 'Proper barcode structure: start code, data, checksum (modulo 103), and stop pattern'
  - Clean visual presentation with appropriate quiet zones for scannability
  - Human-readable text properly positioned below barcode
  - Excellent contrast and crisp bar rendering using imshow with binary colormap
  weaknesses:
  - Could demonstrate subset switching (A/B/C) for optimal encoding efficiency as
    mentioned in spec
  - Encoding tables are comprehensive but make the code lengthy; could be more compact
  image_description: The plot displays a Code 128 barcode rendered as a series of
    vertical black bars on a white background. The barcode encodes the text "SHIP-2024-ABC123"
    which appears centered below the barcode in a bold monospace font. The title "barcode-code128
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top of the image. The barcode includes
    proper quiet zones (white space) on both left and right sides. The bars vary in
    width according to Code 128 encoding standards, with the characteristic start
    pattern, data encoding, checksum, and stop pattern all visible. The layout is
    clean with good use of whitespace and the barcode occupies approximately 60% of
    the canvas width.
