review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent faceted grid layout with clear row (Region) and column (Quarter) organization
  - Good use of px.scatter built-in faceting capabilities with facet_row and facet_col
  - Realistic business scenario with marketing spend vs sales data showing positive
    correlation
  - Clean readable code following KISS principles
  - Appropriate marker sizing and opacity for the data density
  - Proper title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - 'Redundant color encoding: Region is already encoded by facet rows, so using color=Region
    adds no information and creates visual confusion'
  - Should use color to encode an additional dimension or remove color differentiation
    entirely
  - Legend shows Region which is redundant with row labels
  - Only 2 visually distinct colors (blue and yellow) for 4 regions makes differentiation
    within color groups impossible
