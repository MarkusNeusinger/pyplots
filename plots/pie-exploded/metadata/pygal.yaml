review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal XML filter mechanism to implement custom explosion effect
  - Well-designed custom style with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  - Clean color palette with good accessibility
  - Creative approach to exploded pie since pygal lacks native explosion support
  - Both PNG and HTML output provided
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a function definition (explode_slices) which deviates from KISS structure,
    though justified by pygal API design requiring a callable for add_xml_filter
  image_description: 'The plot displays an exploded pie chart titled "Market Share
    Analysis · pie-exploded · pygal · pyplots.ai". It shows 5 company segments: TechCorp
    (35.2%, dark blue, exploded outward), DataFlow (22.8%, yellow), CloudBase (18.5%,
    teal/cyan, slightly exploded), NetSys (14.3%, coral/salmon), and Others (9.2%,
    gray). The pie chart fills approximately 60-70% of the square canvas. Percentage
    labels are displayed within each slice. A legend at the bottom shows all five
    categories in a horizontal row with colored squares. The colors are distinct and
    visually appealing. The TechCorp slice (market leader) is clearly separated/exploded
    from the center, and CloudBase has a smaller explosion effect.'
