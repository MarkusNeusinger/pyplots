review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Symmetric y-axis range around zero for visual balance as specified
  - Clear horizontal reference line at y=0 with dashed styling for visual distinction
  - Good marker visibility with increased dots_size (14) and appropriate transparency
    (0.6)
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper random seed for reproducibility
  - Outliers effectively demonstrate detection capability as intended
  weaknesses:
  - Legend positioned in top-left corner overlaps with the upper plot area; bottom
    placement would be cleaner
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use more descriptive context)
  - Realistic context could be stronger with more specific scenario labeling
  image_description: 'The plot displays a residual scatter plot on a white background
    with blue circular markers (Python Blue #306998) representing residuals plotted
    against fitted values. The fitted values range from approximately 10 to 50 on
    the x-axis, while the residuals span from -8 to +8 on the y-axis with symmetric
    scaling. A dashed red/salmon horizontal reference line at y=0 helps assess systematic
    bias. The title "residual-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center
    in gray text. Axis labels clearly show "Fitted Values" and "Residuals". The legend
    is positioned in the top-left corner showing "Residuals" (blue square) and "Zero
    Reference" (red square). Several outliers are visible at approximately (+15, +8.5),
    (+30, -9.2), and (+42, +7.8). The majority of points cluster randomly around the
    zero line, demonstrating good model behavior. Subtle horizontal dotted grid lines
    aid readability.'
