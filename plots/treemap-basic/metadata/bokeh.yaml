review:
  strengths:
  - Implements squarify treemap algorithm from scratch since bokeh lacks native treemap
    support
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with 5 distinct, visually appealing colors
  - Smart label sizing logic that hides labels on small rectangles to prevent clutter
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output leveraging bokeh strengths
  - Clean data structure with realistic budget allocation scenario
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource and LabelSet for flexible data binding
  weaknesses:
  - Legend overlaps slightly with the treemap content area in upper-right; could be
    positioned outside the plot area
  - No visual hierarchy indication beyond color (e.g., category grouping borders or
    nesting)
  - Code complexity from manual squarify implementation could be simplified if using
    squarify library
  image_description: 'The treemap displays a budget allocation visualization with
    12 nested rectangles representing different departments and projects. The largest
    rectangles are Backend ($220K) in blue and Enterprise ($200K) in teal, positioned
    in the bottom-left quadrant. Categories are color-coded: Engineering (Python blue
    #306998), Marketing (yellow #FFD43B), Sales (teal #4ECDC4), HR (terra cotta #E07A5F),
    and Finance (sage green #81B29A). Each rectangle shows the subcategory name and
    dollar value (e.g., "Frontend $180K", "Digital $150K"). The legend is placed in
    the upper-right corner with colored squares and category labels. The title "treemap-basic
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top. White borders separate rectangles
    clearly.'
