review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the crossword grid using geom_tile for cells
  - Proper 180-degree rotational symmetry in black cell placement
  - Clean, publication-ready monochrome design suitable for printing
  - Correct numbering logic that identifies word start positions (across and down)
  - Good use of coord_fixed(ratio=1) for square cells
  - Appropriate use of theme_void() for clean appearance
  - Correct title format and good text sizing
  - Deterministic, reproducible code with clear structure
  weaknesses:
  - Library features score could be higher; the implementation uses basic lets-plot
    features without leveraging interactive capabilities
  image_description: The plot displays a 15×15 crossword puzzle grid with a clean,
    newspaper-style layout. White entry cells are bordered with black lines, and black
    blocking cells are solid black squares. Clue numbers (1-69) are positioned in
    the top-left corner of cells that start across or down words, displayed in blue
    bold text (#306998). The grid exhibits proper 180-degree rotational symmetry in
    its black cell pattern. The title "crossword-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered above the grid in bold black text. The overall design is monochrome (black
    and white with blue numbers), optimized for printing. The grid uses square cells
    with 1:1 aspect ratio and proper spacing.

        comment: Uses geom_tile effectively, coord_fixed for square aspect ratio,
          theme_void, and lets-plot's ggsize() for proper sizing. Could leverage more
          interactive features.
