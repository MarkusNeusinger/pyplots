review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with all font sizes explicitly configured for target
    resolution
  - Effective diverging RdBu colorscale centered at zero with zmid — immediately reveals
    positive vs. negative growth
  - 'Thoughtful data storytelling: subtitle guides reader to seasonal patterns, data
    engineered with realistic seasonal effects (summer outdoor peaks, Q4 holiday spikes,
    spring fashion, back-to-school)'
  - 'Rich Plotly-specific features: hovertemplate with HTML formatting, HTML subtitle,
    interactive HTML alongside static PNG'
  - Clean KISS code structure with elegant seasonal pattern generation loop
  weaknesses:
  - 'Canvas utilization could be tighter — left margin (160px) and colorbar placement
    leave the heatmap area somewhat constrained with moderate whitespace (VQ-05: 2/4)'
  - 'Aesthetic polish is strong but falls short of publication-ready — could benefit
    from a custom font family or more typographic refinement (DE-01: 6/8)'
  - Cell annotations using texttemplate format +.0f rounds to integers, losing the
    decimal precision available in the data
  image_description: 'The plot displays a heatmap of monthly sales growth percentages
    for 8 retail product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Food & Beverage, Books,
    Sports, Home & Garden, Beauty, Toys) across all 12 months (Jan–Dec). A diverging
    RdBu colorscale is used, centered at zero — blue tones for negative growth, red/warm
    tones for positive growth. Each cell contains an annotated value with sign (e.g.,
    +14.3, -15.3). The title reads "Monthly Sales Growth · heatmap-basic · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" with a gray subtitle: "Retail categories show clear seasonal surges
    — summer outdoor/leisure peaks and Q4 holiday gift spikes." A colorbar on the
    right shows "Sales Growth (%)" ranging from roughly -20% to +20%. Clear seasonal
    patterns are visible: Sports, Home & Garden, and Toys show summer peaks (Jun–Aug
    in dark red), while Electronics, Toys, Books, and Beauty show holiday spikes (Nov–Dec
    in deep red/maroon). Clothing shows spring (Apr) and back-to-school (Sep) bumps.
    The background is clean white with subtle gaps between cells.'
