review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of hierarchical drilldown concept using pygal xlink feature
    and embedded JavaScript
  - Well-structured 3-level hierarchy (Company → Divisions → Teams → Sub-teams) with
    realistic business data
  - Clean breadcrumb navigation shown in both the chart and the HTML wrapper
  - Good use of pygal styling system with custom fonts and colors for high-resolution
    output
  - HTML output includes interactive instructions and styled breadcrumb for navigation
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement and styling could be improved for better visual integration
  - Static PNG only shows root level; the drilldown value is primarily in the HTML
    output
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart with three bars representing
    company divisions: Technology ($4,200K), Sales ($3,100K), and Operations ($2,400K).
    The bars are rendered in a consistent blue color (#306998). The title reads "bar-drilldown
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. The Y-axis is labeled "Budget (in thousands
    $)" with values ranging from $0K to $4,000K. The X-axis shows the breadcrumb navigation
    "Breadcrumb: Company" indicating the current hierarchy level. Value labels are
    displayed on top of each bar showing the exact budget amounts. A small legend
    "Divisions" appears in the top-left corner. The background is white with subtle
    horizontal grid lines.'
