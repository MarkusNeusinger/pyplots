review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Voronoi tessellation with proper clipping to bounding box using mirror
    points technique
  - Clear visual differentiation between regions with HUSL color palette and white
    edges
  - Seed points prominently displayed with appropriate sizing and styling
  - Correct title format and well-labeled axes with units
  - Clean, reproducible code with proper random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn usage is limited to styling (set_style, set_context) and scatterplot for
    seed points; the core Voronoi visualization uses scipy and matplotlib patches
  - No legend explaining what the seed points represent (e.g., Store Locations)
  - Some adjacent HUSL colors are similar (multiple pinks/corals near each other)
  image_description: The plot displays a Voronoi tessellation on a 100x100 km coordinate
    system. Twenty seed points (dark blue circles with white edges, size ~350) are
    distributed across the plane. Each seed point has its own Voronoi cell, colored
    distinctly using the seaborn "husl" palette with alpha=0.7 transparency. Colors
    include teal, olive green, coral/salmon, pink/magenta, orange, and seafoam green.
    White edges (linewidth 2.5) separate adjacent regions. The diagram is bounded
    to [0,100] on both axes, with cells clipped at boundaries. Title "voronoi-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" appears at top in bold. Axis labels read "X Coordinate
    (km)" and "Y Coordinate (km)" with tick labels at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. A subtle
    blue border frames the plot. The layout uses equal aspect ratio, resulting in
    a near-square visualization.
