review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent label collision avoidance algorithm prevents text overlap
  - Clean color coding distinguishes increases from decreases effectively
  - Professional styling with removed top/right/bottom spines for clean slopegraph
    aesthetic
  - Properly sized text elements for high-resolution output (4800x2700)
  - Realistic business context with quarterly product sales comparison
  weaknesses:
  - Data labels on the left side show adjusted positions that do not align perfectly
    with the actual data point markers
  - Legend placed in upper right could be more elegantly positioned below the title
    or integrated differently
  - Right-side labels only show values without product names, requiring visual line-following
    to identify products
  image_description: 'The plot displays a slope chart (slopegraph) with 8 products
    comparing Q1 2024 vs Q4 2024 sales figures in millions of dollars. Blue lines
    represent products with increased sales, while yellow/gold lines show decreases.
    Products are labeled on the left side with their name and Q1 value (e.g., "Product
    C: $15.2M"), and the right side shows Q4 values (e.g., "$18.5M"). The title "slope-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend in the upper right distinguishes
    "Increase" (blue) from "Decrease" (yellow). The Y-axis shows "Sales (Millions
    $)" ranging from ~6 to 18, with horizontal gridlines. Time periods "Q1 2024" and
    "Q4 2024" are bold labels at the bottom.'

        comment: Grid is subtle at alpha 0.3 with dashed style, but legend placement
          in upper right overlaps potential data space and feels slightly disconnected

        comment: Uses matplotlib properly with ax methods, Line2D for custom legend,
          spines manipulation. Could leverage more advanced features like annotations
          with arrows or ConnectionPatch
