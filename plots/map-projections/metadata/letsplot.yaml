review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format following the specification
  - Good use of Tissot indicatrices concept to demonstrate projection distortion
  - Clean visual design with appropriate color contrast (blue continents, yellow circles)
  - Proper graticule implementation at 30° intervals
  - Uses lets-plot distinctive coord_map() function
  - Caption explaining the Tissot indicatrices is helpful
  weaknesses:
  - Tissot indicatrices appear as uniform circles across all latitudes; they should
    become elliptical and stretched at higher latitudes to show actual Mercator distortion
  - Continent shapes are extremely simplified polygons rather than actual geographic
    boundaries
  - Only shows one projection (Mercator-like via coord_map) instead of comparing multiple
    projections as spec suggests
  - No legend explaining what the blue shapes and yellow circles represent
  - Missing actual country borders and clean coastlines as specified
  - The os/shutil imports for file workaround are non-ideal
  image_description: The plot displays a world map with simplified continent polygons
    in blue (#306998) on a light blue background (#e6f0f5). Yellow Tissot indicatrices
    (circles) are distributed across the map at regular intervals (every 30° latitude,
    every 60° longitude). The graticule (lat/lon grid) is shown as dashed gray lines.
    The continents rendered include North America (upper left), South America (lower
    left center), Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The Tissot circles appear uniform
    in size across all latitudes, which is unusual for a Mercator-like projection
    where they should become more distorted (elliptical and larger) at higher latitudes.
    The title "map-projections · letsplot · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top in
    bold. Axes show Longitude (-180 to 180) and Latitude (-70 to 70). A caption at
    the bottom explains the Tissot indicatrices.
