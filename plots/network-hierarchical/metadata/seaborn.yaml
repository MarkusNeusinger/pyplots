review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical tree layout with clear level differentiation
  - Good use of color to distinguish hierarchy levels (Python blue/yellow theme)
  - Clean visual design with appropriate node sizing by level
  - Realistic organizational chart scenario with meaningful labels
  - Proper title format following spec requirements
  weaknesses:
  - Level 3 node labels could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  - sns.set_style() is deprecated in favor of sns.set_theme()
  - numpy imported but seed is deterministic anyway since layout is explicit
  image_description: The plot displays a hierarchical network graph representing a
    software project team organizational structure with 24 employees across 4 levels.
    The root node (CEO) is positioned at the top center as a large dark blue (#306998)
    circle. Three VP nodes (VP Engineering, VP Product, VP Operations) are on Level
    1 in yellow/gold (#FFD43B). Six Directors/Managers are on Level 2 in lighter blue
    (#4B8BBE), and 14 team members form Level 3 at the bottom in green (#8BC34A).
    Gray edges connect parent-child relationships with good visibility (linewidth=2.5,
    alpha=0.7). Node labels appear below each node using annotate with appropriate
    font sizes based on hierarchy level (12pt for executives, 10pt for managers, 9pt
    for team members). The background is a light gray (#f8f9fa), and a legend in the
    upper right explains the hierarchy levels with marker colors. The title uses the
    correct format "network-hierarchical · seaborn · pyplots.ai" at 24pt bold. Axis
    labels describe the conceptual dimensions ("Organization Width" and "Hierarchy
    Level (Top to Bottom)") without numeric ticks, which is appropriate for this type
    of network visualization.
