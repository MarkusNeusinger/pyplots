review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data design showing diverse distributions (tight, wide, bimodal, outliers)
    that effectively demonstrates swarm plot capabilities
  - Clean implementation of median markers with proper legend explanation
  - Proper use of hue parameter with legend=False to avoid seaborn 0.14+ deprecation
    warnings
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible and visually appealing
  - Appropriate point size and alpha for the data density
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could include units (e.g., "Performance Score (points)" or "Performance
    Score (0-100)")
  - Could leverage more seaborn features like sns.set_theme() for consistent styling
  image_description: 'The plot displays a swarm plot showing employee performance
    scores across four departments: Engineering (blue), Marketing (yellow), Sales
    (teal), and Support (coral/salmon). Each department has its data points spread
    horizontally in a beeswarm pattern to avoid overlap, clearly showing the distribution
    shape. The title "swarm-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is at the top. The y-axis
    shows "Performance Score" ranging from about 30 to 100, and the x-axis shows "Department"
    with the four category labels. Each department has a dark diamond marker indicating
    the median value. A legend in the upper right identifies the diamond as "Median".
    The grid is subtle with dashed horizontal lines. The Engineering group shows a
    tight cluster around 75-90, Marketing has a wider spread with some points below
    50, Sales shows a bimodal pattern with clusters around 60-70 and 80-90, and Support
    shows outliers both high (~95) and low (~45-48).'
