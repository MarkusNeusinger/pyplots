review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent total label implementation with bold 36pt font and proper vertical offset
  - Clean segment separation using white line borders (line_color="white", line_width=2)
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Well-proportioned font sizes scaled appropriately for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Y-axis range properly extended to accommodate labels above bars
  weaknesses:
  - Legend position in top right slightly crowds the Q4 bar label area
  - Could use HoverTool to showcase Bokeh interactive capabilities
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked bar chart with 4 quarterly categories
    (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) on the x-axis. Each bar consists of 4 stacked segments representing
    product categories: Electronics (dark blue #306998), Clothing (golden yellow #FFD43B),
    Home & Garden (teal #4ECDC4), and Sports (coral #FF6B6B). Bold total value labels
    are positioned above each bar stack: $123M (Q1), $157M (Q2), $173M (Q3), and $220M
    (Q4). The title "bar-stacked-labeled · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top
    left. A legend with all four categories is positioned in the top right corner
    with a semi-transparent white background and gray border. The y-axis is labeled
    "Revenue ($M)" and x-axis is labeled "Quarter". The plot has an off-white background
    (#fafafa) with subtle dashed horizontal grid lines. White borders separate the
    stacked segments for clarity.'
