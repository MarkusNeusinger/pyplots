review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent semicircular seat arrangement algorithm with proper left-to-right party
    assignment
  - Clean legend with seat counts using lambda for label formatting
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with theme_void and coord_fixed
  - Proper categorical ordering for consistent legend display
  - Uses neutral fictional party names avoiding political controversy
  weaknesses:
  - Seat markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Does not include optional majority threshold line mentioned in spec
  image_description: 'The plot displays a semicircular parliament seat chart with
    320 total seats arranged in 8 concentric arcs. Individual seats are rendered as
    colored dots. From left to right, the parties are: Progressive Alliance (blue
    #306998, 85 seats), Center Coalition (yellow #FFD43B, 72 seats), Conservative
    Union (teal #4ECDC4, 68 seats), Green Future (green #2ECC71, 42 seats), Liberal
    Democrats (purple #9B59B6, 35 seats), and Independent Group (gray #95A5A6, 18
    seats). The legend is positioned at the bottom in a 2-row horizontal layout, showing
    party names with seat counts in parentheses. The title "parliament-basic · plotnine
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top in bold. The visualization uses theme_void
    with a clean white background.'

        comment: Uses plotnine grammar of graphics well (ggplot, geom_point, theme_void,
          scale_color_manual, guide_legend); coord_fixed for aspect ratio; could leverage
          more advanced features
  verdict: APPROVED
