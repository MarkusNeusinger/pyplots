review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly's Scatter3d with proper colorscale and colorbar
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Correct title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  - Good camera angle providing clear 3D perspective
  - Generates both PNG and interactive HTML output
  weaknesses:
  - Colorbar title font could be larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Data uses generic coordinate labels rather than a more compelling real-world scenario
  - Could leverage Plotly's hover templates for richer interactivity
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3D scatter plot with points distributed
    across three-dimensional space. The title "scatter-3d · plotly · pyplots.ai" is
    centered at the top in black text. The plot uses the Viridis colorscale where
    colors range from dark purple (low Z values around -10) through teal/blue (mid
    Z values around 0) to bright yellow/green (high Z values around 10). Three distinct
    clusters are visible: one cluster in the upper region with yellow-green points
    (high Z), one cluster in the middle-lower area with teal/blue points (mid Z),
    and one cluster with purple/blue points (low Z). All three axes are labeled: "X
    Coordinate (units)", "Y Coordinate (units)", and "Z Coordinate (units)". A vertical
    colorbar on the right shows "Z Value (units)" with tick marks from -10 to 5. The
    background is white with subtle gray gridlines. Point size is uniform and markers
    have good opacity (0.8). The camera angle provides a good 3D perspective view.'
