review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of alternating y_offset heights for event labels prevents overlap
  - Clean ggplot2 grammar implementation with proper layering of geoms
  - Good color contrast between data line (blue) and event markers (red)
  - Appropriate figure sizing with scale=3 for high-resolution output
  - Data shows realistic growth pattern with trend, seasonality, and event impacts
  weaknesses:
  - X-axis label says Day of Year 2024 but displays month names - should be consistent
  image_description: 'The plot displays a line chart of Daily Active Users throughout
    2024. A blue line (#306998) shows user growth from ~1,000 in January to ~7,500
    by December, with visible trend and seasonality. The x-axis shows months (Jan-Jan),
    and the y-axis shows "Daily Active Users" (0-7,500). Five vertical dashed red
    lines (#DC2626) mark significant events with red diamond markers and bold black
    labels: "Feature A" (Feb), "Feature B" (May), "Mobile App" (Jul), "API v2.0" (Oct),
    and "Partners" (Nov). Labels are positioned at staggered heights (4800-6400) to
    avoid overlap. The title "line-annotated-events · letsplot · pyplots.ai" appears
    at top in red. Clean minimal theme with subtle gray gridlines.'

        comment: X-axis says "Day of Year 2024" but displays month names, which is
          slightly confusing; Y-axis says "Daily Active Users" (no units, but users
          don't need units)
