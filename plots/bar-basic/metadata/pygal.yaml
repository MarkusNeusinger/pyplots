review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text legibility with explicitly set font sizes appropriate for 4800x2700
    canvas
  - 'Effective color hierarchy: darker Python Blue highlights the leading category,
    lighter blue for the rest'
  - Strong spec compliance — all required features present including value labels
    and spacing
  - Good use of pygal-specific features (per-bar dict styling, rounded_bars, print_values,
    value_formatter)
  - Clean, realistic business data scenario with sensible values
  weaknesses:
  - Canvas utilization could be improved — right side of chart has empty space as
    bars decrease in height
  - Data storytelling is limited — descending sort and color emphasis are good, but
    no annotations or narrative callouts to explain the insight
  - Grid lines (dashed) are still somewhat prominent; more subtle styling or removing
    them would improve refinement
  - Per-bar data construction code is slightly verbose — could be simplified
  image_description: The plot shows a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · pygal
    · pyplots.ai" with 6 bars representing annual revenue by product category, sorted
    in descending order. Electronics ($58,200) is rendered in a darker Python Blue
    (#306998) to highlight the leader, while the remaining 5 bars (Clothing $37,400,
    Home & Garden $24,800, Sports $15,300, Books $9,100, Toys $4,600) use a lighter
    muted blue (#7FACC6). Dollar-formatted value labels appear above each bar. The
    y-axis reads "Revenue (USD)" with labels from $0 to $60,000 in $10,000 increments.
    The x-axis reads "Category" with all 6 category names clearly readable and unrotated.
    The background is white with a light gray (#FAFAFA) plot area and subtle dashed
    horizontal grid lines. Bars have slightly rounded corners. No overlap issues are
    visible. Overall the chart is clean, professional, and readable.
