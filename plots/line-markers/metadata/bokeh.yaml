review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of different marker shapes (circle, square, triangle) for series
    differentiation
  - Clean implementation of monthly temperature data with realistic seasonal patterns
  - Good color palette that is colorblind-accessible (blue, yellow, red)
  - Properly sized text for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs generated
  - Good use of ColumnDataSource for data management
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text and glyph sizes could be slightly larger for better visibility at
    full canvas size
  image_description: The plot displays a line chart with markers showing monthly temperature
    readings for three weather stations over 12 months (January to December). Station
    A is represented in blue with circular markers, Station B in yellow with square
    markers, and Station C in red/coral with triangle markers. All three lines follow
    a seasonal temperature pattern peaking in July-August. The title reads "line-markers
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top left. The legend is positioned in the upper left
    corner showing all three stations. X-axis shows month abbreviations (Jan-Dec),
    Y-axis shows "Temperature (°C)" ranging from 0 to ~25. A subtle dashed grid is
    visible in the background.
