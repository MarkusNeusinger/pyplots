review:
  strengths:
  - Strong color contrast between significant (blue) and non-significant (gray) coefficients
  - 'Excellent use of Bokeh-specific features: HoverTool with detailed tooltips showing
    variable, coefficient, CI, and status'
  - Clean horizontal layout matching spec preference for long variable names
  - Professional styling with appropriate font sizes for large canvas
  - Zero reference line clearly visible as dashed line
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in top-right slightly overlaps with the data region where Square
    Footage coefficient extends
  - Grid styling could be slightly more subtle (currently at alpha=0.3, could be 0.2)
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal coefficient plot with 10 predictor
    variables for a housing price prediction model. Variables are listed on the y-axis
    (Property Tax Rate, Age of House, Garage Size, Number of Bedrooms, Lot Size, Number
    of Bathrooms, Distance to City Center, School Rating, Crime Rate Index, Square
    Footage) ordered by coefficient magnitude. The x-axis shows "Coefficient Estimate
    (Standardized)" ranging from approximately -0.4 to 0.6. A vertical dashed dark
    gray reference line at x=0 indicates the null hypothesis threshold. Significant
    coefficients (p < 0.05) are displayed in vivid blue (#2171b5) while non-significant
    coefficients appear in muted gray (#969696). Each coefficient is represented by
    a point marker with horizontal confidence interval bars. The legend in the top-right
    corner clearly distinguishes "Significant (p < 0.05)" and "Not Significant" categories.
    The background is light gray (#fafafa) with subtle dashed grid lines. The title
    "coefficient-confidence · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears at the top left.
