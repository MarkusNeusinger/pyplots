review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts native stackLabels feature for total labels with proper
    formatting ($XXK)
  - Clean colorblind-safe color palette following library guidelines
  - Proper segment data labels within each bar
  - Professional tooltip showing both individual values and stack totals
  - Correct title format and descriptive subtitle
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned too far from the chart with excessive whitespace gap
  - Code complexity higher than necessary due to Selenium/urllib requirements (unavoidable
    for highcharts)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a stacked column chart with 4 quarters (Q1,
    Q2, Q3, Q4) on the x-axis and "Revenue (thousands USD)" on the y-axis. Each bar
    consists of 4 stacked segments representing product categories: Electronics (blue
    #306998), Clothing (yellow #FFD43B), Home & Garden (purple #9467BD), and Sports
    (teal #17BECF). Total value labels are prominently displayed above each stack
    in bold format ($310K, $385K, $400K, $440K). Individual segment values are shown
    within each bar segment. The legend is positioned at the top right with horizontal
    layout. The title correctly follows the format "bar-stacked-labeled · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" with a subtitle explaining the data context. Grid lines are subtle
    and the overall layout is clean and professional.'
