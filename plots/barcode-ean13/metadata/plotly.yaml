review:
  strengths:
  - Correct EAN-13 encoding implementation with L, G, and R code patterns
  - Proper guard bar heights (taller than data bars)
  - Clean human-readable digit placement with first digit outside left guard
  - Good use of Plotly shapes and annotation systems
  - Deterministic output with real product code example
  weaknesses:
  - Guard pattern indices may be slightly off (positions 45-50 should be 45-49 for
    center guard)
  - HTML output is generated but interactivity does not add value for static barcode
  image_description: 'The plot displays a properly rendered EAN-13 barcode on a white
    background. The barcode consists of black vertical bars of varying widths encoding
    the number "4006381333931" (a German product code). The title "barcode-ean13 ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in black text. The human-readable
    digits are displayed below the barcode: the first digit "4" is positioned to the
    left of the left guard bars, digits "006381" appear below the left half of the
    barcode, and digits "333931" appear below the right half. The start, center, and
    end guard patterns are rendered taller than the data bars, which is standard EAN-13
    formatting. The barcode is centered horizontally on the canvas with adequate quiet
    zones on both sides.'
