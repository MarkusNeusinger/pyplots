quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of cumulative gains chart with all three required curves
    (model, random baseline, perfect model)
  - Clear, readable text sizing following the library guidelines (28pt title, 22pt
    labels, 18pt ticks)
  - Good use of Plotly fill feature to highlight the gain over baseline
  - Well-structured code with clear data simulation using beta distributions for realistic
    model scores
  - Correct title format and professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in lower-right corner has minor overlap with the baseline diagonal
    line
  - Could better leverage Plotly interactive features (hover tooltips with specific
    values, annotations for key thresholds)
