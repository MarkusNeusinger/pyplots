review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of geom_segment with appropriate sizing for Gantt bars
  - Clean implementation of the current date marker with dashed red line
  - Well-organized categorical color palette matching project phases
  - Proper task ordering by start date with reversed y-axis for logical top-to-bottom
    flow
  - Perfect title format and comprehensive theme customization
  weaknesses:
  - Yellow (#FFD43B) and light blue (#4B8BBE) colors may be difficult to distinguish
    for some colorblind users; consider using a colorblind-safe palette
  - The lineend="butt" parameter in geom_segment may cause deprecation warnings in
    newer plotnine versions
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal Gantt chart for a software development
    project. It shows 10 tasks (Requirements, UI Design, Backend Architecture, Database
    Setup, API Development, Frontend Development, Integration, Testing, Documentation,
    Deployment) arranged vertically on the y-axis. The x-axis shows dates from mid-January
    2025 to mid-March 2025 with rotated date labels. Each task is represented by a
    horizontal bar spanning from start to end date. Tasks are color-coded by phase:
    Planning (dark blue), Design (yellow), Development (light blue), QA (gray), and
    Deployment (green). A dashed red vertical line indicates the current date (Feb
    10, 2025). The legend on the right shows the Phase categories. The title reads
    "gantt-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in bold.'

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_segment for bars, scale_color_manual
          for custom colors, theme customization. Could have used faceting or additional
          plotnine-specific features for enhancement.
  verdict: APPROVED
