review:
  strengths:
  - Correct implementation of Point and Figure algorithm with proper 3-box reversal
    logic
  - Good use of plotnine grammar of graphics with layered composition
  - Excellent text sizing following the 16:9 canvas guidelines
  - Clean code structure with well-commented P&F algorithm
  - Proper color coding with green X's and red O's as specified
  weaknesses:
  - Legend displays prefix before labels (shows "a Falling (O)" instead of "Falling
    (O)")
  - Red-green color combination could be improved for better colorblind accessibility
  - Box size of $2 on ~$100 price is relatively large (2%), typical P&F uses smaller
    relative box sizes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Point and Figure chart with columns of X''s
    (green, #2E8B57) representing rising prices and O''s (red, #DC143C) representing
    falling prices. The X-axis shows "Column (Reversals)" ranging from 0 to 20, and
    the Y-axis shows "Price Level ($)" ranging from approximately 82 to 158. The chart
    effectively shows the characteristic pattern of P&F charts with columns of only
    X''s or only O''s, demonstrating clear uptrends (columns of X''s extending upward)
    and downtrends (columns of O''s extending downward). The title correctly uses
    the format "point-and-figure-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai". A legend on the right
    indicates "Direction" with "Falling (O)" and "Rising (X)" labels. The grid has
    horizontal lines at price levels which aid readability, and the minimal theme
    provides a clean background.'
