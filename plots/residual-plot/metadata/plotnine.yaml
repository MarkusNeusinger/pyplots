review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: zero reference line, ±2σ bands,
    LOWESS smoothing, and outlier coloring'
  - Clean ggplot2-style grammar of graphics approach with proper layering of geoms
  - Good visual hierarchy with distinct colors for normal points (blue) vs outliers
    (red/coral)
  - Appropriate sizing and alpha for 150 data points
  - Manual OLS calculation demonstrates understanding without external dependencies
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (e.g., could use more descriptive context like "Fitted
    Response" or add domain context)
  - Data is somewhat generic - could use a more realistic scenario with meaningful
    variable names instead of abstract X/y_true
  image_description: 'The plot displays a residual plot with fitted values (ranging
    from ~3 to ~23) on the x-axis and residuals (ranging from ~-7 to ~8) on the y-axis.
    The title "residual-plot · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at the top.
    Points are colored by type: blue (#306998) for "Normal" points and red/coral (#E74C3C)
    for "Outlier" points. A dark blue horizontal reference line at y=0 represents
    perfect predictions. Two gray dashed horizontal lines mark the ±2 standard deviation
    boundaries for outlier detection. A yellow LOWESS smoothing line runs through
    the data near zero, showing no strong systematic pattern. The legend labeled "Point
    Type" appears on the right side. The background uses theme_minimal with subtle
    gray gridlines.'

        comment: Grid is subtle but legend title says "Point Type" (should match data
          semantics better); also the grid is slightly prominent

        comment: Shows outliers (4 points beyond ±2σ), random scatter around zero

        comment: Good use of ggplot grammar with geom_point, geom_hline, geom_smooth,
          scale_color_manual, and theme customization; could leverage more plotnine-specific
          features like faceting or stat_smooth variants
  verdict: APPROVED
