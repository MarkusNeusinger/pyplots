review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent three-panel design effectively communicates the drill-down hierarchy
    concept
  - Good use of breadcrumb navigation boxes with consistent styling
  - Effective visual highlighting of drillable regions (bold blue borders)
  - Clean handling of potentially overlapping city labels through manual positioning
  - Appropriate use of seaborn scatterplot with size encoding for the cities panel
  weaknesses:
  - Panels 1 and 2 rely heavily on matplotlib Rectangle patches rather than seaborn
    plotting functions
  - The colorbar overlaps slightly with the middle panel x-axis label (Longitude partially
    obscured)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a three-panel layout showing a hierarchical geographic drill-down visualization of sales revenue data.

    Panel 1 (Level 1: Countries): Shows 5 countries (USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina) represented as rectangles on a coordinate grid with longitude/latitude axes. Each country is colored using a Blues colormap based on sales value, with USA highlighted with a bold blue border ($4,500M). A "World" breadcrumb appears in the top-left corner.

    Panel 2 (Level 2: States): Drills into USA showing 6 states (California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Washington) as rectangles. California is highlighted with a bold blue border ($1,200M). A "World > USA" breadcrumb is displayed.

    Panel 3 (Level 3: Cities): Drills into California showing 6 cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, San Jose, Sacramento, Fresno) as bubbles using seaborn scatterplot with size encoding. Los Angeles is the largest bubble ($450M). A "World > USA > California" breadcrumb is shown. A legend showing "Sales" values is in the lower right.

    Blue arrows connect the panels indicating drill-down flow. A horizontal colorbar at the bottom shows "Sales Revenue ($M)" from ~50 to ~4500. The title correctly uses the format "map-drilldown-geographic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" with an italic subtitle explaining the interaction concept.
