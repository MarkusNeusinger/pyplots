review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent gradient fill implementation that fades from top to bottom, creating
    visual depth
  - Good use of realistic website traffic data with seasonal patterns and growth trend
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper title format matching spec requirements
  - Markers with white borders add visual polish
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label could benefit from units (e.g., Page Views thousands)
  - Legend positioned far from data in top-right corner; could be integrated closer
    to the chart
