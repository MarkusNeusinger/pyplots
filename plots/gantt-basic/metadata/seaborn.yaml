review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a Gantt chart using seaborn barplot with creative
    use of date2num conversion for positioning
  - Well-chosen software development project scenario with realistic task durations
    and overlapping activities
  - Colorblind-friendly custom palette with 6 distinct category colors
  - Proper use of matplotlib.dates for date formatting and axis locators
  - Clean Today indicator line with dashed style and good visibility
  - Tasks logically sorted by start date for easy reading
  - Proper axis inversion to show first tasks at top
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in lower right overlaps with the Frontend Development and Backend
    Development bars - should be moved outside the plot area or to upper right
  - The grid on y-axis (alpha=0.15) is unnecessary for a Gantt chart and adds visual
    noise
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal Gantt chart for a software development
    project timeline spanning January to April 2025. It shows 12 tasks organized from
    top to bottom: Training, Deployment, User Acceptance Testing, Integration Testing,
    Documentation, API Integration, Unit Testing, Frontend Development, Backend Development,
    Database Design, UI/UX Design, and Requirements Analysis. Each task is represented
    as a horizontal bar with its position on the x-axis indicating the timeframe.
    Tasks are color-coded by category: blue for Planning (Requirements Analysis),
    yellow/gold for Design (UI/UX Design, Database Design), light blue for Development
    (Backend, Frontend, API Integration), gray for Testing (Unit, Integration, User
    Acceptance), brown for Documentation, and green for Deployment (Deployment, Training).
    A red dashed vertical line indicates "Today" (Feb 15, 2025). The legend is positioned
    in the lower right corner. The x-axis shows dates in "Mon DD, YYYY" format with
    labels rotated 45 degrees. The title "gantt-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed
    prominently at the top.'
