review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of viridis colormap with colorbar for depth perception as spec recommends
  - Semi-transparent bars (alpha=0.85) help reveal bars behind taller ones per spec
    guidance
  - Well-chosen viewing angle (elev=25, azim=45) provides good visibility of all bars
  - Professional title format and axis labels with units
  - Realistic sales data scenario with meaningful variation between products and quarters
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Grid styling could use alpha parameter for subtler appearance
  - Could benefit from slightly more contrast in bar heights (all values in 65-225
    range, some near-zero values would show more variation)
  image_description: The plot shows a 3D bar chart with 5 products (Product A through
    E) on the x-axis, 4 quarters (Q1-Q4) on the y-axis, and sales values (ranging
    from ~65 to ~225) on the z-axis. The bars use a viridis colormap where purple/dark
    blue represents lower values (~65-100), teal/green for mid-range values (~120-160),
    and yellow for higher values (~200-225). The viewing angle is set at elevation
    25° and azimuth 45°, providing good visibility of most bars. A colorbar on the
    right reinforces the sales values. The bars have semi-transparent faces (alpha=0.85)
    with dark gray edges. All axis labels are clear and readable, with "Product" and
    "Quarter" labels and "Sales (thousands $)" on the z-axis.

        comment: Uses bar3d which is matplotlib's standard 3D plotting, but doesn't
          use advanced features like annotations, custom lighting, or multiple subplots
          for rotation views
  verdict: APPROVED
