review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper segment sizing proportional to total trade
    volume
  - Well-implemented bezier ribbons connecting regions with appropriate transparency
  - Good use of inner track to display additional GDP growth data
  - Realistic trade flow scenario with sensible numeric values
  - Clean legend placement and region labeling with proper text rotation
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Inner track annotation positioned at bottom-left is quite small and easy to miss
  - Title font at 48pt appears relatively small for the 3600x3600 canvas size
  - Some ribbon colors could use slightly more differentiation when many overlap in
    the center
