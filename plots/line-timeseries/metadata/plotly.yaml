review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent seasonal temperature model with realistic sinusoidal pattern peaking
    in late July
  - Clean, professional visual design with well-chosen font sizes for 4800x2700 output
  - Custom hovertemplate provides good interactivity with formatted date and temperature
  - Proper use of plotly_white template for clean appearance
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated correctly
  weaknesses:
  - Missing plotly-specific features like range slider (rangeslider), zoom buttons
    (rangeselector), or spike lines that are distinctive for time series
  - 'Grid/legend scoring: legend disabled but could optionally show the series name'
  - Line width could be slightly increased (3.0) for better visibility at high resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a time series line chart showing daily temperature
    readings throughout 2024. The line is a medium blue color (#306998), plotted against
    a clean white background with subtle gray gridlines. The x-axis shows months from
    January 2024 to December 2024 with monthly tick marks (format: "Mon YYYY"). The
    y-axis shows temperature in degrees Celsius ranging from approximately -5°C to
    35°C. The title "Daily Temperature 2024 · line-timeseries · plotly · pyplots.ai"
    is centered at the top. The data shows a clear sinusoidal seasonal pattern with
    temperatures lowest in winter (around -5°C to 5°C in Jan/Dec) and highest in summer
    (around 25°C to 35°C in Jul/Aug), with realistic daily noise variation.'
