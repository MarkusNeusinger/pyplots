review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of position=fill for proper 100% stacking normalization
  - Colorblind-safe color palette with good visual distinction between energy sources
  - Real-world data scenario (European energy mix) that demonstrates meaningful proportional
    differences
  - Clean, well-organized code following KISS principles
  - Proper categorical ordering ensures consistent stacking across all bars
  - Good text sizing for 4800x2700 output with scale=3
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (current default may be slightly prominent)
  - Could add percentage labels inside segments for larger portions to enhance readability
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 100% stacked bar chart showing the energy
    source mix across six European countries (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Poland).
    Each bar reaches 100% and is divided into five colored segments representing different
    energy sources: Coal (dark gray), Natural Gas (blue), Nuclear (purple), Renewables
    (green), and Other (light gray). The y-axis shows "Share of Energy Mix" with percentage
    labels from 0% to 100%. The x-axis shows "Country" with the six country names.
    A legend on the right side clearly identifies each energy source. The title reads
    "bar-stacked-percent · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top. The chart uses
    a minimal theme with subtle horizontal grid lines.'

        comment: Uses ggplot grammar with position="fill", scale_y_continuous with

          features
  verdict: APPROVED
