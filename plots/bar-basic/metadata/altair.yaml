review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative API with proper encoding types and layer composition
    for bars + labels
  - Text legibility well handled with explicitly set font sizes throughout
  - Clean data scenario with realistic retail sales values and proper dollar formatting
    on both axes and value labels
  - Sorted bars by descending value aids readability and comparison
  - Rounded top corners on bars add a subtle professional touch
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis has excessive tick density (25 tick labels from $0 to $50,000 in $2,000
    increments) — reduce to fewer, rounder intervals (e.g., $0, $10k, $20k, $30k,
    $40k, $50k)
  - No data storytelling — no annotations highlighting the top performer or providing
    context (e.g., Electronics leads with $45.2k)
  - Missing visual emphasis to guide the viewer eye (e.g., highlight the top bar,
    add a subtle color gradient, or distinguish top vs. bottom performers)
  image_description: The plot displays a vertical bar chart titled "bar-basic · altair
    · pyplots.ai". It shows 7 product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden,
    Sports, Books, Toys, Food) sorted in descending order by sales value on the x-axis,
    with x-axis labels rotated at approximately -45 degrees. All bars are rendered
    in Python Blue (#306998) with rounded top corners. Each bar has a dollar-formatted
    value label centered above it ($45,200 down to $12,300). The y-axis is labeled
    "Sales ($)" with dollar-formatted ticks at $2,000 intervals from $0 to $50,000.
    The x-axis is labeled "Product Category". The background is clean white with no
    border, and subtle dashed horizontal gridlines appear at low opacity. The layout
    is landscape (16:9 proportions) and the chart fills the canvas reasonably well.
