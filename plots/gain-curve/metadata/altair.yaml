review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair's layered composition pattern with separate charts for
    model curve, area fill, baseline, and custom legend elements
  - Clean implementation of monotone interpolation for smooth curve rendering
  - Good visual hierarchy with shaded area under the model curve providing clear differentiation
    from baseline
  - Proper use of Altair's configure_axis and configure_view for styling
  - Custom legend implementation shows creative use of mark_line and mark_text layers
  weaknesses:
  - Custom legend placement in upper-left overlaps the plot data area slightly; consider
    moving to a less intrusive location
  - The axis labels include (%) in the title text but this could be formatted more
    consistently
  image_description: The plot shows a cumulative gains chart with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
    The title "gain-curve · altair · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center in a dark
    font. The main model curve is displayed as a solid blue line (#306998) that starts
    at the origin (0,0) and curves upward above the diagonal, reaching 100% at the
    right edge. A light blue shaded area fills under the model curve, providing visual
    emphasis. The diagonal dashed gray line represents the "Random (Baseline)" reference.
    The x-axis is labeled "Population Targeted (%)" ranging 0-100, and the y-axis
    is labeled "Positive Cases Captured (%)" ranging 0-100. A custom legend in the
    upper-left area shows "Model" (solid blue line) and "Random (Baseline)" (dashed
    gray line). The grid is subtle with light dashed lines. Text sizes are appropriate
    and readable.

          a steeper initial curve would better demonstrate the value proposition
