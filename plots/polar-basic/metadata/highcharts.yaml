review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts polar chart capability with proper configuration
  - Realistic 24-hour temperature scenario directly from spec applications
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  - Clean, readable code structure with reproducible seed
  - Good color choice (Python Blue) that is colorblind-safe
  - Properly downloads and embeds Highcharts JS including highcharts-more.js for polar
    support
  - Interactive HTML version also saved with responsive sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis (radial) title is rotated vertically making it harder to read
  - Grid alpha could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3 rather than 0.15)
  - Could use hour labels (0h, 6h, 12h, 18h) instead of degrees for better context
  image_description: The plot displays a polar chart with a white background. The
    title "polar-basic · highcharts · pyplots.ai" is shown in bold black text at the
    top, with the subtitle "24-Hour Temperature Pattern" below it in gray. The circular
    chart has angular axis labels at 30° intervals (0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°) around
    the perimeter. The radial axis shows temperature in Celsius from 0°C to 30°C with
    gridlines every 5°C, and a rotated "Temperature (°C)" label. Data points are connected
    by blue lines forming an irregular polygon shape, showing temperature variation
    throughout a 24-hour cycle. The temperatures are lower around 0° (near the center)
    and higher around 90-180° (extending outward). A legend at the bottom shows "Temperature"
    with a blue marker. The chart uses a blue color (#306998) which is colorblind-safe.
