review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and well-chosen font
    sizes
  - Clear notch visualization that enables statistical comparison between groups
  - Good data variety showing different distribution shapes, spreads, and outliers
    across departments
  - Realistic salary data context that demonstrates practical application
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is disabled (showlegend=False) - while x-axis labels work, an explicit
    legend would improve accessibility
  - Could leverage Plotly interactive features more (custom hovertemplate showing
    statistics)
  image_description: 'The plot displays 5 notched box plots showing employee salary
    distributions across departments (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance).
    Each department has a distinct color: Engineering (steel blue #306998), Marketing
    (yellow #FFD43B), Sales (green #2CA02C), HR (purple #9467BD), and Finance (pink
    #E377C2). The notches around the medians are clearly visible and properly shaped.
    Outliers appear as individual circular markers beyond the whiskers - notably visible
    for Engineering (high outliers around $145k-$150k and low around $42k), Sales
    (high at $135k, low at $25k-$28k), HR (low around $33k), and Finance (high at
    $140k, low at $45k). The title "box-notched · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top. Y-axis displays "Annual Salary (USD)" with currency formatting ($20,000
    to $140,000+). X-axis shows "Department" with all 5 department names clearly readable.
    Background uses plotly_white template with subtle gridlines.'

        comment: Uses go.Box with notched=True, but doesn't leverage Plotly's interactive
          hover features in any meaningful way (static output). Could use hovertemplate
          for enhanced tooltips.
  verdict: APPROVED
