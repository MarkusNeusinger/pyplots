review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette with distinct colors for each component (blue,
    yellow, purple, teal)
  - Clear vertical stacking of all four decomposition components with shared time
    axis
  - Proper use of statsmodels seasonal_decompose for accurate decomposition
  - Good handling of NaN values in trend and residual components
  - Well-formatted datetime axis labels (YYYY-MM format)
  - Generates both static PNG and interactive HTML output
  - Realistic airline passenger dataset with appropriate 10-year monthly span
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses a helper function (create_chart_config) which slightly violates the
    KISS principle for plot implementations
  - Individual subplot heights appear somewhat compressed - could benefit from slightly
    taller subplots
  - Legend text could be slightly larger for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: The plot displays a time series decomposition with four vertically
    stacked subplots, each sharing a common time axis from 2018-01 to 2028-01. The
    first subplot shows the **Original Series** in blue (#306998), displaying airline
    passenger data with both upward trend and seasonal variation, ranging from ~50
    to ~400 thousand. The second subplot shows the **Trend Component** in yellow/gold
    (#FFD43B), displaying a smooth upward trend from ~100 to ~300. The third subplot
    shows the **Seasonal Component** in purple (#9467BD), with regular annual cycles
    oscillating between approximately -40 and +40. The fourth subplot shows the **Residual
    Component** in teal (#17BECF), with random noise fluctuating around zero between
    approximately -40 and +40. Each subplot has clear titles, y-axis labels with units,
    legends on the right side, and light grid lines. The main title "timeseries-decomposition
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top.
