review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of DFS maze generation algorithm ensuring exactly one
    solution path
  - Clean black-and-white design optimized for printing as specified
  - Perfect title format and clear START/GOAL markers with directional arrows
  - Good code structure following KISS principles
  - Appropriate 3600x3600 square format for maze puzzle
  weaknesses:
  - START and GOAL labels/arrows are positioned somewhat far from the actual maze
    openings
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive capabilities (hover, zoom) which could enhance
    the puzzle experience in HTML version
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 cell rectangular maze puzzle on a white
    background with black walls. The maze fills most of the square canvas (3600×3600
    px). At the top-left corner, there is a "START" label in blue (#306998) with a
    downward-pointing arrow indicating the entrance opening. At the bottom-right corner
    outside the maze, there is a "GOAL" label in blue with an upward-pointing arrow
    indicating the exit. The title "maze-printable · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears
    centered at the top in black text. The maze has clearly defined passages and walls
    with consistent thickness, suitable for printing. The black-and-white design provides
    excellent contrast for print applications.
