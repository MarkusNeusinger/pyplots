review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of QR code structure with proper finder patterns,
    timing patterns, and alignment pattern
  - Clean, high-contrast black-on-white rendering perfect for QR codes
  - Good use of matplotlib imshow with nearest-neighbor interpolation for crisp module
    edges
  - Appropriate square figure format (12x12) for QR code visualization
  - Informative annotations showing encoded content and version information
  - Proper quiet zone implementation (4 modules)
  weaknesses:
  - The QR code is a structural visualization, not a truly scannable QR code (spec
    recommends using qrcode library for actual encoding)
  image_description: 'The plot displays a QR code visualization on a white background.
    The title "qrcode-basic · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in blue
    (#306998) with bold styling. The QR code itself is a 21×21 module Version 1 pattern
    with high contrast black modules on white. Three finder patterns (7×7 squares
    with nested black-white-black pattern) are correctly positioned in the top-left,
    top-right, and bottom-left corners. Timing patterns (alternating black-white modules)
    connect the finder patterns horizontally and vertically. An alignment pattern
    (5×5) is visible in the lower-right area. The data area contains a pattern derived
    from encoding "https://pyplots.ai". A white quiet zone surrounds the QR code.
    Below the code, "Encoded: https://pyplots.ai" is displayed in monospace font (#555555),
    followed by a smaller note "QR Code Version 1 (21×21) with Error Correction Level
    M" in gray (#888888). The layout uses a square 12×12 inch figure with the QR code
    well-centered.'
