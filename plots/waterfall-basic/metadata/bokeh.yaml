review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of waterfall chart logic with proper bar positioning
    (floating bars for changes)
  - Clear visual distinction between totals (blue), increases (green), and decreases
    (red)
  - Connector lines effectively show the cumulative flow between bars
  - Well-formatted value labels with +/- signs for changes
  - Good use of Bokeh ColumnDataSource and FactorRange for categorical data
  - Proper canvas utilization at 4800x2700 with appropriate font scaling
  - Clean, readable code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Missing HoverTool for interactivity (Bokeh key strength)
  - Red-green color scheme could be improved for colorblind accessibility (consider
    blue-orange)
