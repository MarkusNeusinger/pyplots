review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar with clean layered syntax (ggplot + geom_bar
    + geom_text + labs + theme)
  - Value labels with dollar formatting using format_string add significant readability
  - Text sizing follows library guidelines perfectly (title 24pt, axis 20pt, ticks
    16pt)
  - Realistic business scenario with plausible sales data across product categories
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate figure size (16:9)
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines use default plotnine styling; could be more subtle with explicit alpha
    setting
  - Could use scale_y_continuous to add dollar formatting to y-axis tick labels for
    consistency with value labels
  image_description: 'The plot displays a vertical bar chart showing sales data across
    6 product categories. The bars are rendered in a consistent blue color (#306998).
    The x-axis shows "Product Category" with labels: Books, Clothing, Electronics,
    Home & Garden, Sports, and Toys. The y-axis shows "Sales ($)" ranging from 0 to
    approximately 45,000. Each bar has a value label positioned above it showing the
    exact sales figure with dollar formatting (e.g., $45,200, $32,800, etc.). The
    title reads "bar-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai" in the correct format. The plot
    uses a clean minimal theme with a light gray background and subtle gridlines.
    The layout is well-balanced with a 16:9 aspect ratio.'

          but could leverage more plotnine features like scale_y_continuous for formatting
