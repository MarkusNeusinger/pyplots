review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using choropleth coloring to show Mercator distortion by latitude
    zone
  - Educational value with correctly explained polar region distortion in Mercator
    projection
  - Clean well-commented code explaining Robinson-like base projection vs Mercator
    distortion
  - Professional diverging purple-green color scheme that is colorblind accessible
  - Accurate distortion factors based on real mathematical relationship
  weaknesses:
  - Cannot display graticule (latitude/longitude grid lines) - library limitation
  - Cannot show Tissot indicatrices to visualize distortion - library limitation
  - Cannot show side-by-side projection comparison - only one projection available
  - Some small countries are difficult to see clearly
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a world map using pygal_maps_world (Robinson-like projection). Countries are color-coded into four latitude-based categories showing Mercator projection distortion factors:

    - Dark purple (60°+ latitude, distortion ≥2.4×): Greenland (most prominent), parts of Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Finland
    - Light purple (30°-60° latitude, distortion 1.2-2.4×): USA, UK, Chile, Germany, France, Argentina, New Zealand, Japan, China, Australia, Russia
    - Light green (15°-30° latitude, distortion 1.1-1.2×): Mexico, Egypt, South Africa
    - Dark green (0°-15° latitude, distortion <1.1×): Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia, Nigeria, DR Congo, Ecuador, Uganda, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines

    The title "map-projections · pygal · pyplots.ai" is clearly visible at top. A horizontal legend at the bottom shows all four categories with their distortion ranges. Non-highlighted countries appear in light gray with visible borders. The map uses a clean white background with good overall layout.
