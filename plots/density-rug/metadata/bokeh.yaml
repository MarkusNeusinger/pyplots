review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of manual KDE calculation using Silverman's rule for
    bandwidth selection
  - Bimodal data effectively demonstrates the value of combining KDE with rug marks
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern for Bokeh
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Rug marks correctly placed below y=0 axis with appropriate transparency
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines are slightly too prominent (alpha 0.3 with dashed style; could use
    0.2)
  - Does not leverage Bokeh's interactive features like HoverTool
  image_description: 'The plot displays a kernel density estimation (KDE) curve in
    blue (#306998) with semi-transparent fill (alpha ~0.4) showing API response time
    distribution. The distribution is clearly bimodal: a primary peak around 120ms
    (normal operations) and a secondary smaller peak around 220ms (slow responses).
    Rug marks appear as subtle vertical tick marks along the x-axis below y=0, showing
    the exact location of each of the ~220 data points. The marks are denser in the
    80-160ms range, matching the KDE peak. The title "density-rug · bokeh · pyplots.ai"
    is in the top-left. Axes are labeled "Response Time (ms)" and "Density". Grid
    lines are dashed and subtle. Background is light gray (#fafafa).'
