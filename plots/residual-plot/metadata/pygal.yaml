review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent implementation of all spec requirements: zero reference line, ±2σ threshold
    bands, and outlier highlighting in different color'
  - Realistic house price prediction context with appropriate heteroscedasticity pattern
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper random seed
  - Good use of pygal XY chart with custom styling for high-resolution output
  - Proper axis labels with units and correct title format
  weaknesses:
  - Legend text at bottom is too small to read clearly at the rendered scale
  - Grid guides could be more subtle (lower alpha) for better visual balance
