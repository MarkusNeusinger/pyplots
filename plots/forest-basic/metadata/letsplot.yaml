review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the forest plot structure with all required elements
    (point estimates, CIs, pooled diamond, null reference line)
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles with logical data organization
  - Good use of lets-plot ggplot2-style grammar including geom_polygon for the diamond
    shape
  - Appropriate text sizing for 4800x2700 output (title 24pt, axis text 16pt, axis
    title 20pt)
  - Realistic meta-analysis data with meaningful variation in effect sizes and weights
  - Proper marker sizing proportional to study weight using scale_size_identity()
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size variation based on weight is subtle and could be more visually distinct
    (range of 2-10 is narrow)
  - Grid styling could be improved - currently using panel_grid_major_y=element_blank()
    but might benefit from subtle horizontal grid lines for readability
  - The plot could benefit from lets-plot interactive features like tooltips showing
    exact values on hover
