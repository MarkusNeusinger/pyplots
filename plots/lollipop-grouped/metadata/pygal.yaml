review:
  strengths:
  - Creative approach using XY chart to create lollipop visualization since pygal
    lacks native lollipop support
  - Clean color scheme with good accessibility (blue, yellow, green)
  - Well-organized legend at bottom with proper column layout
  - Good use of node size differentiation (r=0 for base, r=22 for marker)
  - Appropriate canvas sizing (4800x2700) with scaled font sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Function definition (x_label_formatter) slightly deviates from pure KISS structure
  - Legend entries show small color squares rather than lollipop symbols
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped lollipop chart showing quarterly
    revenue by product line across four regions (North, South, East, West). Three
    series are represented: Electronics (blue #306998), Furniture (yellow #FFD43B),
    and Apparel (green #2ecc71). Each region has three lollipops positioned side-by-side
    with slight horizontal offsets. The stems are thin vertical lines extending from
    the baseline (0) to circular markers at the data values. The title "lollipop-grouped
    · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. The y-axis shows "Revenue ($ millions)"
    ranging from 0 to ~55, and the x-axis shows "Region" with category labels. A legend
    at the bottom identifies the three series in a horizontal layout.'
