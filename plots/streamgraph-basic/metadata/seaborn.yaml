review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of centered baseline streamgraph algorithm
  - Beautiful color scheme combining Python branding colors with colorblind-safe palette
  - Realistic data with seasonal patterns and trends that demonstrate the visualization
    effectively
  - Clean separation between layers using white edge lines
  - Well-executed seaborn styling with despine and subtle grid
  - Perfect title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Uses matplotlib fill_between for core plotting rather than native seaborn functions
    (acceptable since seaborn lacks native streamgraph support)
  - Missing smooth interpolation/spline curves - uses linear interpolation between
    points rather than flowing curves as suggested in spec notes
  image_description: 'The plot displays a streamgraph showing music streaming hours
    by genre (Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Classical, Jazz) over 24 months from
    2023-04 to 2024-10. The chart has a symmetric, centered baseline creating a river-like
    appearance. Colors used are: Python blue (#306998) for Pop at the bottom, Python
    yellow (#FFD43B) for Rock, light blue for Hip-Hop, orange for Electronic, teal/green
    for Classical, and darker orange for Jazz at the top. The title reads "streamgraph-basic
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Month" with date
    labels. Y-axis is hidden. A legend in the upper left identifies each genre. The
    plot fills the canvas well with balanced proportions.'

        comment: Uses sns.set_theme, sns.despine, and seaborn color palettes, but
          the core plotting is done with matplotlib's fill_between rather than a native
          seaborn plotting function
  verdict: APPROVED
