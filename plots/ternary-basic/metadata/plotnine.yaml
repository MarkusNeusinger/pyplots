review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of ternary coordinates using plotnine grammar
    of graphics
  - Clean well-organized code with proper Cartesian coordinate conversion
  - Realistic soil composition context with proper scientific application
  - Professional appearance with consistent blue color scheme
  - Proper grid lines at 20% intervals on all three axes
  - All tick labels correctly positioned along edges
  weaknesses:
  - Triangle could be larger to better utilize the 16:9 canvas (currently ~40% utilization)
  - Title format includes Soil Composition prefix rather than pure spec-id format
  - Data points clustered toward center; could benefit from more extreme compositions
  - Tick label font size (10pt) is on the smaller side for 4800x2700 output
