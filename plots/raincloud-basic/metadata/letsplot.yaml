review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent raincloud metaphor execution: clouds rise above, rain falls below each
    category baseline with correct orientation'
  - Strong data storytelling with two annotations and arrows highlighting Treatment
    A speed improvement and Treatment B bimodality
  - Bimodal Treatment B distribution effectively demonstrates why raincloud plots
    matter (boxplots would hide this)
  - 'Publication-quality aesthetic: custom palette, refined background, subtle gridlines,
    intentional typography hierarchy'
  - Idiomatic lets-plot usage with show_half parameter and position_nudge for component
    separation
  weaknesses:
  - Treatment B jittered points in the left cluster (around 300ms) are somewhat densely
    packed despite size 3.5 and alpha 0.6, slightly reducing individual point visibility
  - Annotation text at size=10 is on the smaller side relative to axis labels; could
    benefit from slightly larger annotation text for better readability at full resolution
  image_description: 'The plot displays a horizontal raincloud plot with three experimental
    conditions (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B) on the y-axis and Reaction Time
    (ms) on the x-axis, ranging from 200 to 700. Each condition shows three layered
    elements: a half-violin (cloud) extending above the category baseline, a white
    boxplot centered on the baseline, and jittered points (rain) scattered below the
    baseline. Control is steel blue (#306998) with a normal distribution centered
    around 450ms. Treatment A is golden yellow (#FFD43B) centered around 380ms. Treatment
    B is green (#5BA85B) with a clearly bimodal distribution showing two clusters
    around 300ms and 540ms. Two italic text annotations with arrows guide the viewer:
    one noting "~70ms faster mean than Control" pointing to Treatment A, and another
    noting "Two distinct response clusters" with two arrows pointing to the two modes
    of Treatment B. The background is light gray (#FAFAFA) with subtle x-axis gridlines.
    No legend is shown; categories are identified by bold y-axis labels. The title
    reads "raincloud-basic · letsplot · pyplots.ai" in bold at the top.'
