review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of small multiples grid to represent temporal animation when native
    animation is not available
  - Viridis-inspired colorblind-safe palette is well-chosen for sequential data
  - Realistic seismic activity scenario with believable geographic spread pattern
  - Clean combination of pygal maps with PIL for composite image creation
  - Both PNG and interactive HTML outputs provided
  weaknesses:
  - Legend appears on every panel individually which creates visual redundancy (the
    code intends shared legend but each panel still shows its own)
  - Some smaller countries like Taiwan are difficult to see due to geographic scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2×3 grid of world maps showing "Seismic
    Activity Temporal Progression" across 6 time periods (T1: Initial through T6:
    +72h). Each map shows countries in the Pacific Ring of Fire region colored by
    seismic intensity using a viridis-inspired sequential palette (yellow to dark
    purple). The activity starts concentrated in Japan (dark red/purple) and spreads
    outward over time to Korea, Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Malaysia, New Zealand,
    Australia, and eventually to South America (Chile, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador). Each
    panel has its own legend at the bottom showing 6 activity levels: Minimal (<20),
    Low (20-35), Moderate (35-50), High (50-65), Severe (65-80), and Extreme (80+).
    The main title at the top correctly includes the spec-id, library, and pyplots.ai
    branding. The maps have white backgrounds with subtle country boundaries.'
