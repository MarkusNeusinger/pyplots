review:
  strengths:
  - Clean maze generation using Kruskal's algorithm with proper Union-Find implementation
  - Excellent KISS code structure with no unnecessary functions or classes
  - Good canvas utilization with the maze filling most of the available space
  - Proper concentric ring structure with increasing sector counts
  - Black-on-white color scheme perfect for printable puzzle output
  - Correctly placed entry point on outer boundary with visible gap
  - Reproducible with fixed random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Center goal marker renders as small blue circle with OA text instead of the intended
    star shape - the custom SVG path for the star may not be rendering correctly in
    all export scenarios
  - START label appears upside down when viewed normally since it is positioned at
    the bottom of the circular layout
  image_description: The plot displays a circular maze with 7 concentric rings rendered
    in black walls on a white background. The title "maze-circular · altair · pyplots.ai"
    appears at the top in a clean sans-serif font. At the center is a small blue circle
    containing "OA" text (intended to be a star-shaped goal marker but rendering incorrectly).
    The "START" label appears at the bottom in blue (#306998) but is displayed upside
    down relative to the viewer due to its position on the lower portion of the circle.
    The outer boundary has a visible gap at the bottom serving as the entry point.
    The maze walls are consistently thick black lines (strokeWidth=3) with proper
    arc segments for ring walls and radial lines connecting sectors. The maze structure
    shows varying sector counts per ring (increasing outward) with algorithmically
    generated passages using Kruskal's algorithm. The overall layout is square (900x900
    properties) with balanced margins and good canvas utilization.

        comment: Does not use Altair's declarative/data-binding strengths effectively.
          The implementation treats Altair as a low-level drawing tool, manually constructing
          coordinates for line segments rather than leveraging Altair's data transformation
          and encoding capabilities. A maze is inherently a non-tabular visualization
          which is not Altair's strength.
