review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution to render 3D surfaces in lets-plot (a 2D library)
    using polygon-based projection with painter's algorithm
  - Proper implementation of 3D-to-2D projection with configurable elevation and azimuth
    angles
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility and clear height
    encoding
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear comments explaining each step of the transformation
  - Depth sorting (painter's algorithm) correctly handles polygon occlusion for realistic
    3D appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels could better reflect the 3D nature (e.g., X and Y before projection,
    or note the projection in the label)
  - The Y-axis original dimension is lost in the final visualization (only X and Z
    are labeled)
