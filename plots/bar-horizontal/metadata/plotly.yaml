review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-sized fonts for 4800x2700 output
  - Data scenario (programming language survey) is highly relatable and realistic
  - Proper use of Plotly go.Bar with horizontal orientation and text positioning
  - Clean code following KISS principles
  - Generates both PNG and HTML outputs for interactivity
  - Bars sorted descending for easy comparison as recommended in spec
  weaknesses:
  - Value label font size (32) could be slightly reduced as it appears close to bar
    ends
  - X-axis range padding (1.15x max) creates extra whitespace on right side
  image_description: The plot displays a horizontal bar chart showing survey results
    for "What programming language do you use most?". Ten programming languages are
    listed on the y-axis (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, Ruby,
    PHP, Swift) with horizontal blue bars (#306998) extending to the right representing
    the number of responses. Each bar has a value label displayed outside at the end.
    The bars are sorted in descending order by value, with Python having the longest
    bar (2847 responses) and Swift the shortest (298). The title "bar-horizontal ·
    plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis shows "Number of Responses"
    ranging from 0 to ~3000, and the y-axis is labeled "Programming Language". The
    background uses the plotly_white template with subtle grid lines on the x-axis.
    Overall layout is clean and well-proportioned.

        comment: Uses go.Bar with orientation="h", text labels, template system; generates
          HTML for interactivity. Could leverage more Plotly features like hover customization
          or annotations.
