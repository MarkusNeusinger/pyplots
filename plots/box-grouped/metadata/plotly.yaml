review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent color palette choice (blue/yellow/teal) that is both visually appealing
    and colorblind-accessible
  - Clean data structure with realistic employee performance scenario across departments
    and experience levels
  - 'Properly implements all box plot features: median line, quartile boxes, whiskers,
    and outliers with boxpoints=outliers'
  - Font sizes are well-calibrated for 4800x2700 resolution with title at 32pt, labels
    at 24pt, ticks at 20pt
  - Good use of plotly_white template for clean professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could be Performance Score (0-100) to clarify the scale)
  - Does not leverage Plotly interactive features like custom hover templates showing
    exact statistics
  - Some outliers exceed 100, which is unusual for a 0-100 performance score scale
  image_description: 'The plot displays a grouped box plot showing employee performance
    scores (y-axis, ranging from ~30 to ~110) across four departments (Sales, Engineering,
    Marketing, Support) on the x-axis. Each department contains three side-by-side
    box plots representing experience levels: Junior (steel blue #306998), Mid-Level
    (yellow #FFD43B), and Senior (teal #4ECDC4). The boxes show clear median lines,
    quartile ranges, and whiskers. Outliers are visible as individual points (e.g.,
    low outlier at ~30 for Sales Junior, high outlier at ~112 for Engineering Mid-Level).
    The legend titled "Experience Level" is positioned to the right. The title correctly
    reads "box-grouped · plotly · pyplots.ai" centered at the top.'
