review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent real-world example of diminishing returns in advertising economics
  - R² value and polynomial equation prominently displayed with clean annotation styling
  - Professional color scheme with good contrast between scatter points and regression
    curve
  - Proper use of plotly_white template for clean, publication-quality appearance
  - Outputs both static PNG and interactive HTML for maximum utility
  - All text elements are appropriately sized and readable
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size (14) is slightly small for 80 data points - could be increased to
    18-20 for better visibility
  - Does not use plotly native trendline functionality (px.scatter with trendline
    parameter)
  - No confidence band around the regression curve (optional per spec but would enhance
    visualization)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with 80 data points in blue
    (#306998) with a polynomial regression curve (quadratic, degree 2) in yellow/gold
    (#FFD43B). The title "Ad Spend vs Revenue · scatter-regression-polynomial · plotly
    · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. The x-axis is labeled "Ad Spend ($K)" ranging
    from 0-50, and the y-axis is labeled "Revenue ($K)" ranging from approximately
    10-100. The legend in the top-left corner shows "Data Points" and "Polynomial
    Fit (degree 2)". An annotation box in the bottom-right corner displays "R² = 0.8817"
    and the polynomial equation "y = -0.075x² + 4.75x + 10.8". The background is white
    (plotly_white template) with subtle gray gridlines. The scatter points show a
    clear diminishing returns pattern - revenue increases with ad spend but eventually
    plateaus and decreases.

        comment: Markers at size 14 with 0.65 opacity work well for 80 points, though
          slightly smaller than optimal for the data density (should be closer to

        comment: Uses plotly_white template and annotations well, produces interactive
          HTML output, but doesn't leverage plotly's native trendline capabilities
          (px.scatter with trendline parameter) or hover customization
  verdict: APPROVED
