review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of lower-triangle masking to reduce redundancy as suggested
    in spec
  - Clear, readable correlation annotations with good font size and text outline for
    contrast
  - Proper diverging color scale centered at zero with fixed -1 to 1 range
  - Realistic financial metrics scenario with plausible correlation values
  - Interactive tooltip functionality in the HTML output
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Uses blue-white-yellow color scheme instead of the spec-suggested blue-white-red
    or coolwarm diverging colormap
  - Built with raw HTML/JavaScript rather than the highcharts-core Python library,
    which is the recommended approach in library rules
  - Cell border width (3px) is slightly thick, could be reduced for cleaner appearance
