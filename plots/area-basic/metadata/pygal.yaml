review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the area chart concept with proper fill transparency
    (0.4 opacity)
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Realistic website traffic data with clear weekly patterns (weekend dips, weekday
    peaks)
  - Smart X-axis label strategy showing only every 5th day to prevent clutter
  - Correct title format and proper canvas sizing (4800x2700)
  - Good use of pygal Style class for consistent theming
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label Visitors could include units (e.g., Visitors count)
  - Data dots could be slightly larger for better visibility at the target resolution
  - Could leverage more pygal-specific features like custom tooltips or value formatting
