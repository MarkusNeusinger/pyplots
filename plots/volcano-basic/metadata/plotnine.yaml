review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the volcano plot specification with all required features
    (threshold lines, color coding, gene labels)
  - Clean grammar of graphics approach using plotnine ggplot2-style syntax
  - Good data simulation that realistically represents differential gene expression
    results
  - Text sizes properly configured for 4800x2700 output
  - Proper use of categorical coloring with meaningful significance categories
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap between Gene_469 and Gene_478 on the right side of the plot
  - Could use colorblind-safe palette instead of red-blue (consider using orange or
    different saturation)
  - Grid lines not visible (theme_minimal removes them) which could aid reading values
  image_description: 'The volcano plot displays a scatter plot with Log2 Fold Change
    on the x-axis (ranging from approximately -3 to 4) and -Log10(p-value) on the
    y-axis (ranging from 0 to 4). Three distinct groups of points are visible: blue
    points on the left representing down-regulated genes clustered around x = -2.5
    with high significance (y > 2), gray points in the center showing non-significant
    genes spread across x = -2 to 2 with low significance (y < 1.3), and red points
    on the right representing up-regulated genes clustered around x = 2.5 with high
    significance (y > 2). Dashed threshold lines are present: horizontal line at y
    ≈ 1.3 (significance cutoff) and vertical lines at x = -1 and x = 1 (fold change
    thresholds). Six gene labels are annotated (Gene_416, Gene_415, Gene_443 on the
    left; Gene_469, Gene_478, Gene_475 on the right). The legend shows "Significance"
    with three categories. Title follows the required format.'

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot, aes, geom layers,
          scale_color_manual, theme_minimal), but could leverage more advanced features
          like faceting or stat layers
  verdict: APPROVED
