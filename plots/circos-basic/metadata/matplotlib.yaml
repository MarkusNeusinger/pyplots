review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circular layout with proper segment proportions and visual gaps
  - Bezier curve ribbons correctly show connection magnitude through width
  - Inner data track adds additional information layer as specified
  - Clean colorblind-safe palette with 8 distinct, identifiable colors
  - Professional-quality output suitable for publication
  - Well-structured, readable code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Figure uses 12x12 square format instead of recommended 3600x3600 pixels (12*300=3600,
    so dimensions are correct but explicit figsize comment would help)
  - Legend positioned outside main canvas area requiring bbox_inches=tight - could
    be integrated more elegantly
  - Could use matplotlib built-in Wedge/Arc patches for cleaner segment drawing
  image_description: 'The plot displays a circular Circos visualization showing software
    module dependencies. Eight segments are arranged around a circular ring: Core
    (blue), API (yellow), Database (green), Auth (crimson), Cache (purple), Queue
    (teal), Logger (orange), and Config (gray). Each segment is proportionally sized
    based on module importance. The outer ring shows the segments with white separating
    gaps. An inner concentric track displays bar heights representing importance values
    for each segment. Curved ribbon connections in the center show dependencies between
    modules, with ribbon width proportional to connection strength. The title "circos-basic
    · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top. A legend box labeled "Modules"
    is positioned in the lower right, listing all eight modules with their corresponding
    colors.'

        comment: Good use of PathPatch for Bezier curves, custom polygon drawing with
