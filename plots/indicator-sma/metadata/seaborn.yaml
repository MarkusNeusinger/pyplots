review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data generation with realistic stock price dynamics (geometric random
    walk with drift)
  - Proper use of pandas rolling() for SMA calculations
  - Clean legend with clear series labels
  - Good use of pd.melt() for long-format data suitable for seaborn
  - Well-balanced visual layout with appropriate font sizes
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  weaknesses:
  - Red/green color combination for SMA 50/SMA 200 could be problematic for colorblind
    users; consider using colorblind-safe palette
  - Library features usage is basic - mostly uses lineplot with manual iteration rather
    than leveraging seaborn native hue parameter more elegantly
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Simple Moving Average (SMA) chart for stock
    price data spanning from January 2025 to March 2026. Four lines are shown: a blue
    "Close Price" line showing daily fluctuations, a yellow "SMA 20" line for short-term
    smoothing, a red "SMA 50" line for medium-term trend, and a green "SMA 200" line
    for long-term trend. The price ranges from approximately $85 to $120. The chart
    shows an initial decline from ~$107 to ~$87, followed by a gradual recovery and
    rally to ~$115-120 by late 2025, with subsequent consolidation. The SMA lines
    progressively smooth the data, with the 200-day SMA showing the flattest curve.
    The layout uses a white grid background with dashed gridlines, and a legend is
    positioned in the upper left corner.'
