review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent circle packing algorithm that produces non-overlapping bubbles packed
    efficiently toward center
  - Clean visual design with appropriate colors from seaborn Set2 palette
  - Smart labeling strategy that places text inside large circles and uses annotations
    for smaller ones
  - Realistic market cap data scenario that makes the visualization meaningful and
    relatable
  - Proper area-based scaling (sqrt of value) for accurate visual perception of relative
    sizes
  weaknesses:
  - Seaborn library features are underutilized; most visualization logic is custom
    matplotlib code with seaborn providing only the scatter layer
