review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of seaborn's lineplot with style parameter for automatic marker
    shape differentiation per series
  - Clean, professional visualization with proper font sizing for high-resolution
    output
  - Colorblind-safe custom palette with good contrast between series
  - Realistic data scenario (temperature sensors) that matches the spec's quality
    control application
  weaknesses:
  - Legend frame opacity (framealpha=0.9) is quite opaque; a lower value would be
    more visually appealing
  - Data series patterns are somewhat similar; more variety in trends (e.g., one volatile,
    one cyclical) would better showcase the plot type's utility
