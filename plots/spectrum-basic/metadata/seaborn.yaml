review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with properly sized text elements and good color contrast
  - Realistic machinery vibration scenario with fundamental frequency and harmonics
  - Effective use of fill_between to enhance the spectrum visualization
  - Peak frequency highlighting with vertical dashed lines aids interpretation
  - Proper use of dB scale as recommended in the specification
  - Clean KISS code structure with reproducible random seed
  weaknesses:
  - Uses seaborn primarily for lineplot which is relatively basic; could leverage
    more distinctive seaborn features
  - Grid styling uses alpha=0.3 which is acceptable but slightly at the edge of the
    0.2-0.4 recommendation
  image_description: The plot displays a frequency spectrum with a blue line showing
    amplitude (in dB) on the y-axis ranging from -60 to 10, and frequency (Hz) on
    the x-axis from 0 to 300. The title "spectrum-basic · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is
    clearly displayed at the top. Four distinct peaks are visible at approximately
    50 Hz (~7 dB), 100 Hz (~0 dB), 150 Hz (~-2 dB), and 220 Hz (~-10 dB). Yellow dashed
    vertical lines mark these peak frequencies. The area under the curve is filled
    with a light blue/teal semi-transparent fill. The background noise floor sits
    around -30 to -40 dB with natural variation. Grid lines are subtle and dashed.
    Overall, the plot has a clean, professional appearance with good use of the canvas
    space.
