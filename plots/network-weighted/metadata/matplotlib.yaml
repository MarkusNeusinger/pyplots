review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent force-directed layout implementation from scratch using numpy - demonstrates
    strong matplotlib fundamentals
  - Edge thickness clearly differentiates trade volume with appropriate scaling (1.5-11.5
    linewidth range)
  - Node sizing by weighted degree effectively highlights central hubs like CHN and
    USA
  - Clean region color scheme with good accessibility (blue, yellow, red, green -
    distinguishable)
  - 'Both legends present: region legend and edge thickness annotation explaining
    the weight scale'
  - KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Some node labels slightly overlap with edges in dense areas (CHN/KOR/JPN cluster)
  - The BRA node label appears close to the top edge of the plot area
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a weighted network graph showing international trade relationships between 13 countries. The title "network-weighted · matplotlib · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold black text.

    Nodes are represented as colored circles of varying sizes:
    - Americas (blue): USA, CAN, MEX, BRA - with USA and CHN being the largest nodes indicating highest weighted degree
    - Europe (yellow): DEU, FRA, GBR, ITA - medium-sized nodes clustered on the left side
    - Asia (red): CHN, JPN, KOR, IND - CHN is prominently large in the center-right, JPN also significant
    - Oceania (green): AUS - small green node at the bottom

    Edges connect nodes with varying thickness representing trade volume. The thickest edges are clearly visible between:
    - USA-CAN and USA-MEX (Americas trade corridor)
    - CHN-JPN and CHN-KOR (Asian trade relationships)
    - USA-CHN (major cross-Pacific trade)

    Thinner edges represent smaller trade volumes like IND-AUS and BRA-DEU.

    The layout uses a force-directed algorithm resulting in regional clustering - European countries (yellow) are grouped on the left, Asian countries (red) cluster in the center-bottom, and Americas (blue) spread across the right side.

    Two legends are present:
    1. Upper-left: Region legend showing the four color categories (Americas, Europe, Asia, Oceania)
    2. Lower-left: Edge thickness annotation box explaining "Edge thickness: Trade volume ($20B - $650B USD)"

    The background is white, axes are hidden, and node labels (3-letter country codes) appear above each node in bold gray text. White edge highlights on nodes provide good separation from the gray edges.
