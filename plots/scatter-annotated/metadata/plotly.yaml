review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual annotation positioning with custom offsets for each company prevents
    label overlap
  - Clean annotation styling with white background boxes, blue borders, and connecting
    arrows
  - Good use of realistic tech company data that makes the plot immediately comprehensible
  - Proper title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Both PNG and HTML exports provided
  weaknesses:
  - Does not fully leverage plotly interactive capabilities as a distinctive feature
    (hover is secondary to static annotations)
  - Grid opacity (0.1) is too subtle and could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3 recommended)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart of 12 tech companies comparing
    Market Cap (x-axis, in Billion USD) vs Annual Revenue (y-axis, in Billion USD).
    Each blue circular marker represents a company, with connecting arrows pointing
    to white-background annotation boxes containing company names in bold text. The
    title "scatter-annotated · plotly · pyplots.ai" appears at the top center. Companies
    shown include Amazon (highest revenue ~520B), Apple (highest market cap ~2800B),
    Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, Nvidia, Samsung, TSMC, Oracle, Salesforce, and
    Netflix. The plot uses a clean white template with subtle grid lines, and annotations
    are well-positioned with minimal overlap.

        passed: false
        comment: Uses graph_objects annotations with arrows, but doesn't leverage
          plotly's interactive hover (disabled by using static mode primarily). Hover
          template is defined but the HTML export is secondary. Could better showcase
          plotly's interactivity as a core feature.
  verdict: APPROVED
