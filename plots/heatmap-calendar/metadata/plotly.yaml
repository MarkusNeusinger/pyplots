  strengths:
  - Excellent visual implementation of GitHub-style calendar heatmap with authentic
    green colorscale

    natural activity patterns
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  - Proper handling of week numbering at year boundaries
  - Appropriate cell gaps creating the classic GitHub contribution graph look
  - Good font sizing throughout for readability at 4800x2700 resolution
  - Interactive HTML export leverages Plotly core strength
  weaknesses:
  - Title includes extra context beyond the required format
  - Could leverage more Plotly-specific features like custom hover data showing actual
    dates
  - Colorbar title could include more context
