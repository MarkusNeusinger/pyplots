review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of plotnine grammar of graphics with clean ggplot-style composition
  - Three distinct clusters effectively demonstrate the density contour concept
  - Good overlay of scatter points for context as suggested in spec notes
  - Clean minimal theme with appropriate text sizing
  - Correct title format and colorblind-safe color palette
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (generic Measurement A/B without specifying units)
  - Could utilize filled contours for stronger visual impact as mentioned in spec
  - Contour line thickness could be slightly thicker for better visibility at smaller
    viewing sizes
