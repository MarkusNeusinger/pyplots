review:
  strengths:
  - Well-implemented play/pause and slider controls for animation navigation
  - Good use of Highcharts mapbubble series for geographic point visualization
  - Clean temporal data generation showing spread pattern across Europe
  - Proper title format and date display during animation
  - HTML output allows full interactivity
  weaknesses:
  - Color legend/scale for bubble values is not visible in the rendered output - users
    cannot interpret what the bubble sizes/colors represent
  - Bubble color (olive/khaki) provides weak visual contrast against the gray European
    basemap - should use more vibrant colors
  - Implementation uses raw JavaScript string construction instead of the highcharts-core
    Python library as recommended in library rules
  image_description: 'The plot displays an animated map of Europe showing sensor readings
    over time. The screenshot captures the first frame (Date: 2024-01-01). The map
    shows Europe with a light gray basemap and country boundaries outlined in gray.
    Five bubble markers are visible in Western Europe - clustered around the UK, France,
    Belgium, and Switzerland/Italy area. The bubbles are olive/khaki colored with
    varying sizes representing different sensor values. A "▶ Play" button and time
    slider control are positioned at the bottom of the visualization, along with the
    current date display (2024-01-01). The title "map-animated-temporal · highcharts
    · pyplots.ai" appears at the top with a subtitle showing the current date.'
