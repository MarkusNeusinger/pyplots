review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts packedbubble chart type with proper physics simulation
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between sectors
  - Smart data label filtering to show labels only on larger bubbles (value > 230)
  - Realistic market sector data that perfectly demonstrates the packed bubble use
    case
  - Clean separation of sectors in the legend with appropriate grouping
  - Proper inline JavaScript embedding for headless Chrome rendering
  weaknesses:
  - Large whitespace around the packed bubble cluster could be reduced by adjusting
    layout parameters
  - Title includes extra descriptor which deviates slightly from the pure spec-id
    format
  - Some smaller bubbles have no visible labels even though they are part of the visualization
