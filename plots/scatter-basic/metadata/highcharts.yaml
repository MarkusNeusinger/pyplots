review:
  strengths:
  - Correct title format and clean spec compliance
  - Realistic height-vs-weight data scenario with appropriate scales
  - Explicit font sizing ensures legibility at 4800x2700 resolution
  - White marker edges provide visual separation between overlapping points
  - Alpha transparency at 0.7 as specified in the spec
  - Clean KISS code structure with proper seed for reproducibility
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis extends far beyond data range (to 100 when max is ~92), creating wasted
    space at the top of the chart — should use auto-scaling or set explicit min/max
    closer to data bounds
  - 'No storytelling elements: add a trend line, R-squared annotation, or callouts
    for outliers to guide the viewer'
  - Y-axis gridlines every 2 kg are too dense, creating visual noise — increase the
    tick interval
  - Marker radius=18 is slightly too large for 100 points — causes overlap in dense
    regions around 165-175 cm
  - Does not leverage Highcharts-distinctive features — consider using plotLines,
    plotBands, or data labels for a few key points
  - Design is a well-configured default rather than publication-quality — needs more
    visual refinement
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter chart of Height (cm) on the x-axis
    versus Weight (kg) on the y-axis, with approximately 100 data points. Points are
    rendered as medium-sized blue circles (Python Blue rgba(48,105,152,0.7)) with
    white edge borders against a clean white background. The title "scatter-basic
    · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears at the top in bold. Both axes have descriptive
    labels with units. Light gray gridlines run horizontally and vertically. The data
    shows a clear positive correlation — taller individuals tend to weigh more, with
    heights ranging from ~143-186 cm and weights from ~50-92 kg. There is notable
    empty space at the top of the y-axis (which extends to 100) above the data. No
    legend is shown (single series). The design is clean and functional but visually
    straightforward with no annotations or storytelling elements.
