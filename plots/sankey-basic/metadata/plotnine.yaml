review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative implementation of Sankey diagram using plotnine grammar of
    graphics primitives (geom_polygon, geom_rect, geom_text)
  - Smooth curved flows using cubic interpolation for visually appealing transitions
  - Clear visual hierarchy with distinct colors for sources vs targets
  - Well-positioned flow value labels that avoid overlap
  - Good canvas utilization with balanced layout
  - Real-world energy flow scenario that demonstrates the visualization effectively
  weaknesses:
  - No axis labels (though Sources and Sectors annotations partially compensate)
  - Some flow value labels could be positioned more consistently
