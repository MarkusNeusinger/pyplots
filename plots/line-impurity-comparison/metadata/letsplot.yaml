review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all required features implemented including formulas
    in legend, maximum annotation, edge case handling, and grid
  - Strong visual design with custom color palette, shaded ribbon between curves,
    and thoughtful annotation hierarchy that guides the reader
  - 'Good use of lets-plot distinctive features: layer_tooltips for interactive hover,
    geom_segment with arrow, HTML export alongside PNG'
  - 'Clean educational storytelling: subtitle explains the key insight, annotations
    label the critical points, boundary behavior documented'
  weaknesses:
  - 'Layout balance could be improved: y-axis extends to 1.15 for annotation placement,
    creating wasted vertical space above the data region'
  - Code is slightly verbose with four separate geom_text calls and two separate geom_point
    calls that could potentially be consolidated
  - The arrows_df contains duplicate rows (both point to same location) which is unnecessary
  image_description: 'The plot displays two smooth curves on a clean minimal grid
    background. A blue curve represents Gini impurity (2p(1−p)) peaking at 0.5 at
    p=0.5, and an orange curve represents normalized Entropy peaking at 1.0 at p=0.5.
    A light blue shaded ribbon fills the area between the two curves, visually emphasizing
    their difference. A dashed vertical guideline marks p=0.5. Two open-circle markers
    (orange at the entropy maximum, blue at the Gini maximum) highlight the peak points.
    A bold italic annotation "Maximum uncertainty at p = 0.5" appears above with arrow
    segments pointing down. An italic annotation "Shaded region: difference between
    metrics" appears on the right side. Boundary behavior annotations ("p → 0: both
    → 0" and "p → 1: both → 0") appear at the bottom corners in gray italic. The legend
    at the bottom shows "Gini: 2p(1−p)" and "Entropy (normalized)". The title follows
    the required format "line-impurity-comparison · letsplot · pyplots.ai". Overall
    layout is landscape 16:9 with clean typography and a well-balanced composition.'
