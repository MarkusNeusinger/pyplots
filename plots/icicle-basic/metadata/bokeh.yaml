review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Smart conditional labeling that hides text for small rectangles and includes values
    for larger ones
  - Beautiful color gradient by hierarchy level (Python Blue theme)
  - Level labels on the left margin provide clear context for each row
  - Proportional sizing accurately represents values across the hierarchy
  - Clean white borders and light background enhance readability
  weaknesses:
  - Code uses helper functions (calc_value, assign_level, layout_icicle) instead of
    KISS linear script style
  - Could leverage Bokeh HoverTool for interactive tooltips showing node details
  image_description: 'The plot displays a file system hierarchy as an icicle chart
    with three horizontal layers stacked top-to-bottom. The top layer shows a single
    dark blue (#306998) "Root" rectangle spanning the full width. The second layer
    (Categories) contains three medium blue rectangles: Documents (750 MB), Media
    (1600 MB), and Code (950 MB), with widths proportional to their values. The third
    layer (Subcategories) shows 9 lighter blue rectangles representing leaf nodes:
    Reports (350 MB), Contracts (250 MB), Notes (150 MB), Images (500 MB), Videos
    (800 MB), Audio (300 MB), Python (400 MB), JavaScript (350 MB), and Data (200
    MB). Level labels appear on the left margin (Root, Categories, Subcategories).
    White borders separate rectangles, and the background is light gray (#fafafa).
    The title "File System Structure · icicle-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" is centered
    at the top.'
