review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of letsplot show_half parameter (-1 and 1) to create proper split
    violins
  - Well-designed data scenario with varied distributions showing different improvement
    levels per department
  - Includes inner boxplots for better distribution visualization as recommended in
    spec
  - Proper color scheme using Python Blue/Yellow that is colorblind-safe
  - Interactive tooltips configured for HTML export
  - Correct 16:9 aspect ratio with 3x scale export
  weaknesses:
  - Grid lines appear slightly more prominent than ideal despite alpha=0.3 setting
  - Star import with many noqa comments reduces code clarity
