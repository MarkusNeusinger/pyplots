review:
  strengths:
  - Clear visualization of asymmetric error bars with visible caps and appropriate
    thickness
  - Excellent use of fill_between to show confidence region - enhances visual understanding
  - Well-chosen realistic business scenario with monthly sales data
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good color choice and overall visual balance
  weaknesses:
  - Marker size (15) could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Legend could better explain what asymmetric bounds represent (the fill region
    is not explained)
