review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen Python blue/yellow color scheme that
    provides strong contrast
  - Effective use of Bokeh HoverTool providing detailed information on hover (coordinates,
    class, classification status)
  - Clean implementation of misclassified point highlighting with distinct red X markers
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource pattern for data management
  - Good decision boundary rendering using image with LinearColorMapper
  - Appropriate font sizing for the 4800x2700 canvas
  - Clean, linear code structure following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is placed outside the plot area which creates slight visual separation
    from the main chart
  - The Misclassified legend entry glyph could be more prominent to match the visual
    weight of the X markers in the plot
