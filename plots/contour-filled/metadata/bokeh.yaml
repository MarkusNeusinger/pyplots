review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Viridis colormap for colorblind accessibility
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles
  - Good mathematical surface with multiple peaks demonstrating the visualization
    type well
  - Proper canvas sizing at 4800x2700 with appropriate font scaling
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Missing overlaid contour lines which would help with precise level identification
    (spec suggests this)
  - Generic axis labels (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate) without descriptive context or
    units
  - Colorbar title appears vertical and is difficult to read
  - Grid lines not visible (obscured by the image fill)
  - Uses image() for a heatmap effect rather than true filled contours with discrete
    level bands
