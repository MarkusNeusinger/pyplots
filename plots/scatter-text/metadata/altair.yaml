quality_score: 91
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of mark_text for text-based scatter visualization
  - 'Good interactive features: hover highlight with color/size change, tooltips with
    extra detail'
  - Clean, readable layout with appropriate font sizing and spacing
  - Viridis colormap provides both visual appeal and colorblind accessibility
  - Realistic and engaging dataset (programming languages)
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - The selection_point parameter empty=False is deprecated in newer Altair versions
  - Legend position in top-right corner overlaps slightly with data space (minor)
  image_description: The plot displays a scatter plot with programming language names
    as text labels instead of points. The x-axis shows "Language Age (Years Since
    Creation)" ranging from -2 to 74, and the y-axis shows "Relative Popularity Score"
    ranging from 0 to 105. Text labels are colored using the viridis colormap based
    on popularity (legend on right shows gradient from ~10 purple to ~90 yellow).
    Languages like Python (top, yellow), JavaScript, and Java appear with high popularity,
    while COBOL, Lisp, and Fortran appear in the bottom right as old but less popular
    languages (dark purple/blue). The title correctly reads "scatter-text · altair
    · pyplots.ai" at the top. The layout is clean with good spacing between most labels,
    a subtle grid, and properly sized text.
