review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent geographic data distribution mimicking real seismic zones (Pacific Ring
    of Fire, Mediterranean-Himalayan belt, Mid-Atlantic Ridge)
  - Viridis colormap provides excellent colorblind accessibility and visual appeal
  - Comprehensive hover template showing latitude, longitude, magnitude, and depth
  - White edge outlines on markers improve visibility against map
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs generated for static and interactive viewing
  weaknesses:
  - Size legend is a text annotation rather than a proper bubble size legend (though
    acceptable for this use case)
  - Could add zoom/pan controls configuration or initial view settings for the interactive
    HTML
  image_description: 'The plot displays a world map using Natural Earth projection
    with a light gray landmass (#E5E5E5) and light blue ocean (#D4E8F2). Approximately
    80 scatter points representing global earthquake epicenters are distributed across
    the map, concentrated in seismically active zones: the Pacific Ring of Fire (Japan,
    Indonesia, Chile), Mediterranean-Himalayan belt, and Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Point
    colors use the Viridis colormap encoding earthquake depth (5-300km), ranging from
    dark purple/blue (shallow) to yellow/green (deep). Point sizes vary based on earthquake
    magnitude (3.0-7.5 Richter scale), with larger markers indicating stronger earthquakes.
    White edge outlines around markers enhance visibility. A vertical colorbar on
    the right shows "Depth (km)" with tick values from ~50 to 250+. Below the colorbar,
    a text annotation reads "Point Size = Magnitude" explaining the size encoding.
    The title "scatter-map-geographic · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top.
    Country boundaries are shown with subtle gray lines.'
