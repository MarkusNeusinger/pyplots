review:
  strengths:
  - Clean separation of clusters with distinct colors (Python Blue, Yellow, Red)
  - Good demonstration of silhouette analysis with deliberate cluster overlap showing
    negative values
  - Cluster averages displayed in both legend and x-axis subtitle
  - Proper subsampling of bars for visibility while maintaining pattern
  - Well-structured code with clear comments explaining data generation strategy
  weaknesses:
  - The vertical average reference line (at 0.524) is barely visible and should be
    more prominent as a key visual reference
  - Title format includes extra subtitle which deviates slightly from spec format
