review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Manhattan plot with clear alternating chromosome colors (blue/gray)
    for visual distinction
  - Both genome-wide (red dashed) and suggestive (orange dashed) threshold lines correctly
    positioned at -log10(5e-8) and -log10(1e-5)
  - Smart use of conditional sizing - significant hits above threshold are larger
    (100px) vs non-significant (30px)
  - Chromosome labels clearly positioned below the plot with proper centering
  - 'Good use of Altair features: layered charts, declarative encoding, tooltips for
    interactivity'
  - 'Title follows exact format specification: manhattan-gwas · altair · pyplots.ai'
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis label uses subscript notation (-log₁₀) which displays well, but some tick
    labels on the right side of smaller chromosomes (19-22) appear slightly cramped
