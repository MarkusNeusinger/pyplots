review:
  strengths:
  - Clean implementation of exploded pie chart using Bokeh wedge glyph with manual
    offset calculation
  - Excellent color palette using Python blue as primary with colorblind-safe secondary
    colors
  - Well-formatted legend with percentages included in labels
  - Proper use of square format (3600x3600) for pie chart
  - Generates both PNG and HTML output for interactivity
  - Percentage labels are well-positioned inside slices with good contrast
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is positioned slightly far from the chart, leaving some empty space on
    the right
  - Only one slice is exploded; spec mentions 1-3 slices could be exploded for demonstration
  - Missing HoverTool which would enhance the interactive HTML output with tooltips
  image_description: 'The plot displays an exploded pie chart with the title "pie-exploded
    · bokeh · pyplots.ai" at the top. The chart shows 5 market share segments: "Tech
    Giant" (42.0%) in Python blue (#306998) which is visually exploded/separated from
    the center, "Startup A" (18.0%) in yellow, "Startup B" (15.0%) in green, "Others"
    (14.0%) in purple, and "Legacy Corp" (11.0%) in orange. Each slice has a white
    percentage label positioned inside. The legend is placed on the right side showing
    category names with their percentages. The pie chart uses a 1:1 square format
    (3600x3600) with clean white background and no axes/grid (appropriate for pie
    charts). The explosion effect is clearly visible on the largest "Tech Giant" slice
    which is offset from the center.'

        comment: Uses Bokeh's wedge glyph, ColumnDataSource for labels, LabelSet;
          generates HTML for interactivity. Could leverage more advanced Bokeh features
          like HoverTool for tooltips.
  verdict: APPROVED
