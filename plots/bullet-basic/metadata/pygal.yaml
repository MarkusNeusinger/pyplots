review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using HorizontalStackedBar with custom SVG injection
    to create bullet chart (pygal lacks native bullet chart type)
  - Grayscale qualitative ranges keep focus on the primary measure bar as recommended
    in spec
  - Comprehensive legend clearly identifying all chart elements
  - Realistic sales KPI scenario with appropriate units and values
  - Good colorblind accessibility with grayscale bands and contrasting blue actual
    bars
  weaknesses:
  - Code complexity due to SVG coordinate calculations and manual element injection
    could be cleaner
  - Target markers could use slightly different styling (the spec mentions thin contrasting
    line perpendicular to the bar - current implementation is adequate but thick)
