quality_score: 72
review:
  strengths:
  - Clean P&F algorithm implementation with proper 3-box reversal logic
  - Good use of pygal XY chart for coordinate-based plotting
  - Correct axis semantics (columns vs time, price scale)
  - Well-structured code with clear data generation
  - Appropriate canvas sizing (4800x2700)
  weaknesses:
  - Uses circular dots instead of X and O symbols - P&F charts traditionally use these
    letter symbols for visual distinction
  - Missing support/resistance trend lines mentioned in the specification
  - Red-green color combination has colorblind accessibility issues - consider using
    blue/orange or shapes
  - Grid lines should be at box size intervals ($2) for easier price reading
  image_description: The plot displays a Point and Figure chart using pygal's XY chart
    type. It shows 8 columns (numbered 0-7) representing price reversals. Green circular
    markers represent "X (Rising)" columns showing bullish price movement, while red
    circular markers represent "O (Falling)" columns showing bearish movement. The
    Y-axis shows "Price ($)" ranging from approximately $82 to $110, with horizontal
    grid lines. The X-axis shows "Column (Reversal)" with values 0-7. The title correctly
    displays "point-and-figure-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai". A legend at the bottom
    identifies both series. The overall layout is clean with good use of the canvas
    space.
