review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Altair declarative syntax with theta encoding for pie chart
  - Clean layered approach combining pie slices and text labels
  - Good colorblind-safe palette starting with Python Blue
  - Tooltips add interactivity value to HTML output
  - Well-proportioned square format suitable for pie charts
  - White stroke separation enhances visual clarity
  weaknesses:
  - Missing exploded slice for emphasis on key category (mentioned in spec notes)
  - Title could include a descriptive subtitle for context
  - Pie chart slightly off-center due to legend placement
