review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of the Bland-Altman statistical methodology with correct
    calculations
  - Clear annotations on both legend and right-side text showing exact bias and limits
    of agreement values
  - Realistic blood pressure measurement scenario with appropriate data ranges
  - Clean, readable code following KISS principles
  - Professional color scheme with good accessibility
  weaknesses:
  - Legend and right-side annotations show redundant information; consider removing
    one or making them complementary
  - Marker size (s=150) slightly below the recommended 100-200 range for 80 data points
