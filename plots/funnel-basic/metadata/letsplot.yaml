quality_score: 92
review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with clean trapezoid geometry and smooth color progression
  - Perfect implementation of funnel semantics with proportional widths based on values
  - Clear, readable labels with stage name, value, and percentage on each segment
  - Good use of geom_polygon to create custom funnel shapes not natively available
    in lets-plot
  - Correct title format and appropriate use of theme_void for clean presentation
  weaknesses:
  - Could add np.random.seed(42) comment for reproducibility documentation even though
    data is deterministic
  - HTML output generated but not required by spec (minor)
