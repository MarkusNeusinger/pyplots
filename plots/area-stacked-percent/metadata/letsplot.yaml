review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual clarity with well-chosen colors that are colorblind-friendly
  - Perfect 100% stacked area representation matching the spec exactly
  - Realistic and informative market share scenario that clearly shows composition
    changes over time
  - Clean ggplot2-style code structure using lets-plot grammar of graphics
  weaknesses:
  - Year labels display with comma separators (2,016 instead of 2016) which looks
    unnatural for year values
  - The HTML export setup_html() call is unnecessary overhead for PNG-only output
