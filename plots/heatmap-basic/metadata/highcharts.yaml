review:
  strengths:
  - Clean heatmap visualization with excellent cell color differentiation
  - Value annotations in each cell enhance readability
  - Realistic website traffic scenario with logical patterns (lower weekend, higher
    midday)
  - Proper use of Highcharts heatmap module with colorAxis configuration
  - Colorblind-safe single-hue blue colormap
  - Correct title format following pyplots conventions
  weaknesses:
  - Legend/colorbar could have a title (e.g., Activity Level)
  - Data only shows positive values; spec mentions diverging colormap for +/- values
    (not implemented, though not strictly required for basic)
  - Total and Avg rows/columns semantically unclear in the context of the data
  image_description: 'The heatmap displays a 6x8 matrix of website traffic data by
    time period (rows: Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Total) and day
    of week (columns: Mon-Sun plus Avg). Colors range from white (low values ~0) to
    deep blue (#306998, high values ~100). Each cell contains a numeric annotation
    showing the exact value. The colorbar legend on the right shows the scale from
    0-100. Notable patterns include: Thursday Afternoon shows the maximum value (100),
    while Thursday Night and Midday show lower values (12, 14). Weekend columns (Sat,
    Sun) show generally lower values as expected. Cell borders are white, providing
    clear separation. Title uses the correct format at the top.'

        comment: Uses Highcharts heatmap module, dataLabels, colorAxis, and tooltip.
          Could leverage more advanced features like custom formatters or click handlers
          for interactivity.
  verdict: APPROVED
