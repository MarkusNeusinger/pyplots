review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of OHLC bar structure using Altair layered approach with
    three mark_rule components
  - Creative use of transform_calculate for horizontal tick offsets (10 hours in milliseconds)
  - Colorblind-friendly blue/yellow color scheme
  - Proper use of Vega-Lite encoding types (:T for temporal, :Q for quantitative,
    :N for nominal)
  - Clean, readable code structure with clear comments
  weaknesses:
  - Missing interactivity - Altair main strength is interactive visualization; adding
    .interactive() or tooltips would showcase the library better
  - Grid and legend styling could be more refined - the legend placement in the top-right
    corner is adequate but could be more integrated
  image_description: The plot displays an OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) bar chart showing
    50 trading days of financial data from January to March 2024. Each bar consists
    of a thin vertical line representing the high-low price range, with horizontal
    ticks extending left for the opening price and right for the closing price. The
    chart uses Python Blue (#306998) for "Up" bars (close >= open) and Python Yellow
    (#FFD43B) for "Down" bars (close < open). A clear downtrend is visible from approximately
    $150 to $125. The title "ohlc-bar · altair · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the
    top. A legend labeled "Direction" distinguishes Up vs Down days. The x-axis shows
    dates formatted as "Mon DD" (e.g., "Jan 03", "Feb 15"), and the y-axis displays
    "Price (USD)" ranging from $120 to $174. Subtle grid lines aid in reading exact
    price levels.
