review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent interpretation of animated map spec using small multiples approach appropriate
    for pygal
  - Strong data narrative showing seismic activity spreading across Pacific Ring of
    Fire over time
  - Colorblind-friendly viridis-inspired palette with clear binned categories
  - Both PNG (composite grid) and HTML (interactive final snapshot) outputs provided
  - Clean, well-organized code with clear data structure
  weaknesses:
  - Redundant legends on each panel add visual clutter; could benefit from a single
    shared legend
  - Legend text somewhat small relative to the overall image size
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 2×3 grid of small multiple world maps showing
    "Seismic Activity Temporal Progression" across 6 time periods (T1: Initial through
    T6: +72h). The main title at the top correctly uses the format "{spec-id} · {library}
    · pyplots.ai". Each panel shows a world map with country boundaries, and countries
    are colored according to a viridis-inspired sequential color palette (yellow →
    green → teal → blue → purple) representing seismic intensity from "Minimal (<20)"
    to "Extreme (80+)". The temporal progression shows activity originating in Japan
    and spreading across Pacific Ring of Fire countries (Philippines, Indonesia, Korea,
    Taiwan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador). Each
    panel has its own legend at the bottom showing the 6 activity level categories.
    The maps use white backgrounds with country outlines clearly visible.'
