review:
  strengths:
  - Clear 3-panel layout effectively communicates the drill-down hierarchy concept
  - Consistent color scale across all panels enables meaningful comparison
  - Breadcrumb navigation boxes are well-styled and clearly indicate hierarchy path
  - Good use of seaborn scatterplot with size encoding for the cities panel
  - Appropriate use of Blues colormap for sequential data
  - Title and subtitle formatting is professional
  weaknesses:
  - Minor text overlap in panel 3 between San Jose/San Francisco labels
  - Panel 2 x-axis label (Longitude) is partially obscured by colorbar placement
  - Missing size legend for the scatter points in panel 3
  - Heavy reliance on matplotlib Rectangle patches rather than seaborn native plot
    types for panels 1 and 2
  - Grid could be more subtle (lower alpha)
  image_description: |-
    The plot displays a 3-panel layout showing a geographic drill-down hierarchy for sales data.

    Panel 1 (Left - "Level 1: Countries"): Shows 5 countries in the Americas as rectangles colored by sales value using a Blues colormap. USA is highlighted with a thick blue border ($4,500M), Canada ($1,200M), Mexico ($900M), Brazil ($1,800M), and Argentina ($650M). A "World" breadcrumb is shown in the top-left corner.

    Panel 2 (Center - "Level 2: States (USA)"): Shows 6 US states as rectangles. California is highlighted with thick blue border ($1,200M), Texas ($950M), Florida ($680M), New York ($720M), Illinois ($480M), Washington ($350M). Breadcrumb shows "World > USA". Blue arrows connect panels 1 and 2.

    Panel 3 (Right - "Level 3: Cities (California)"): Shows 6 California cities as circles (using seaborn scatterplot) with size and color encoding value. Los Angeles is largest ($450M), San Francisco ($280M), San Diego ($180M), San Jose ($150M), Sacramento ($90M), Fresno ($50M). Breadcrumb shows "World > USA > California".

    A horizontal colorbar at the bottom shows "Sales Revenue ($M)" ranging from ~50 to 4500. The main title follows the required format. Light blue backgrounds and whitegrid style create a cohesive look.

        comment: Uses sns.scatterplot with size and hue encoding, sns.set_theme, and
          sns.color_palette. Relies heavily on matplotlib patches for rectangle-based
          panels.
