review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution for 3D in a 2D library using isometric projection
    with proper rotation matrices
  - Depth sorting and size variation create effective pseudo-3D depth perception
  - Clean implementation of custom 3D axis lines with arrows
  - Viridis colormap effectively adds fourth dimension (Z-value) encoding
  - Proper use of ColumnDataSource and Bokeh idioms
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - Marker sizes (15-35px) are slightly small for optimal visibility at 4800x2700;
    could be increased to 25-50px
  - Colorbar title is somewhat generic; could clarify relationship to Z-axis
  - Grid is visible in the 2D projection space which slightly conflicts with the 3D
    axis visualization aesthetic
  image_description: 'The plot displays a 3D scatter visualization using an isometric
    projection onto a 2D canvas. Three dark gray axis lines with arrow tips emanate
    from a central origin point, labeled "X-Axis (units)", "Y-Axis (units)", and "Z-Axis
    (units)". The scatter points (150 total) form three distinct clusters in 3D space,
    projected to 2D. Points are colored using the Viridis colormap based on their
    Z-value (elevation), ranging from deep purple (low Z ~-2) through green to yellow
    (high Z ~4). A vertical color bar on the right side is titled "Color: Elevation"
    with numeric scale markers. The title "scatter-3d · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top left. The background is a light off-white (#f9f9f9) with subtle dashed
    grid lines. Marker sizes vary based on depth to create a pseudo-3D effect.'

        comment: 'Title 48pt is excellent, axis labels at 44pt are very readable,
          colorbar text is clear. Slightly deducted because colorbar title "Color:
          Elevation" is rotated and harder to read at a glance.'

        comment: Markers sized 15-35px are visible but slightly small for 150 points
          at this canvas size. Alpha 0.8 works well. Could be slightly larger.

        comment: Good use of canvas space, though the plot is slightly left-heavy
          with more whitespace on the right near the colorbar.

        comment: Grid is subtle (alpha 0.25) which is good, but slightly visible.
          Colorbar is well placed.

        comment: Uses ColumnDataSource, ColorMapper, interactive tools (pan, zoom,
          box_zoom, reset, save). However, the plot is saved as static PNG which limits
          the interactivity benefit. The HTML export does provide interactive capability.
  verdict: APPROVED
