review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual representation of step function behavior with clear horizontal
    and vertical transitions
  - Thoughtful addition of markers at data points and fill under the curve enhances
    visual understanding
  - Realistic server capacity scenario that demonstrates practical application of
    step plots
  - Clean, well-structured code following KISS principles with appropriate font sizes
    for 4800x2700 output
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement in upper right overlaps with peak data region; upper left would
    be better
  - Could utilize more advanced matplotlib features (annotations at key transitions,
    twin axes for additional metrics)
