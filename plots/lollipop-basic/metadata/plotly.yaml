review:
  strengths:
  - Clean, minimalist lollipop chart that perfectly matches the spec description
  - Excellent text legibility with appropriately scaled fonts for high-resolution
    output
  - Good use of plotly Graph Objects for precise control over stems and markers
  - Hover template provides formatted dollar values for interactivity
  - Data is properly sorted descending for easy comparison
  - White marker borders provide nice visual separation
  weaknesses:
  - Data values are too perfectly rounded (all multiples of 1000) - more realistic
    data would have varied precision
  - Could leverage more plotly-specific features like custom hover modes or improved
    interactivity
  image_description: The plot displays a basic lollipop chart showing product sales
    by category. Ten categories are displayed on the x-axis (Electronics, Clothing,
    Home & Garden, Sports, Books, Toys, Beauty, Automotive, Food & Grocery, Health)
    with sales values on the y-axis ranging from $0 to approximately $137,500. Each
    data point consists of a thin blue vertical stem (#306998) extending from the
    baseline to a circular blue marker with a white border. The title "lollipop-basic
    · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top. Category labels are rotated -45
    degrees. Y-axis shows dollar formatting with grid lines. Data is sorted descending
    from Electronics ($125,000) to Health ($31,000). The plot uses plotly_white template
    for a clean background.
