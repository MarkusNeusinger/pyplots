review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visualization of step function with clear horizontal and vertical transitions
  - Realistic server load scenario that demonstrates the plot type well
  - Perfect text sizing and legibility at target resolution
  - Good use of markers to highlight actual data points on the step line
  - Clean color scheme (Python blue/yellow) with good colorblind accessibility
  - Proper title format following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - sns.set_style("whitegrid") is called after figure creation, which may not apply
    the style correctly (should be called before plt.subplots)
  - Limited use of seaborn-specific features - the implementation relies heavily on
    matplotlib drawstyle parameter passed through seaborn
  image_description: 'The plot displays a step line chart showing server load percentage
    (0-100%) over 24 hours (Hour of Day 0-23). A blue step line with `steps-post`
    style creates clear horizontal segments that persist until the next data point,
    then jump vertically to the new value. Yellow circular markers (with blue edges)
    appear at each data point, making the actual measurements visible. The title "line-stepwise
    · seaborn · pyplots.ai" is displayed at the top. The background uses seaborn''s
    whitegrid style with subtle dashed grid lines (alpha ~0.3). X-axis ticks appear
    every 2 hours. The data shows a realistic server load pattern: low overnight (~15-25%),
    ramping up in morning (~40-70%), peak during business hours (~75-92%), and declining
    in evening back to ~25%.'

        comment: Grid alpha is 0.3 which is acceptable, but no legend is needed here
          (-0 for no legend issue, however `sns.set_style("whitegrid")` is called
          after subplot creation which may not apply correctly)

        comment: Uses `sns.lineplot` with drawstyle and `sns.scatterplot`, but drawstyle
          is a matplotlib passthrough parameter, not a seaborn-native feature. Could
          have used more seaborn-specific features like statistical aggregation or
          themed palettes.
  verdict: APPROVED
