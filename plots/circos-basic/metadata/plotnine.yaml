review:
  strengths:
  - Impressive manual construction of Circos plot using plotnine basic geoms (polygons,
    paths, text)
  - Clean bezier curve implementation for ribbon connections
  - Good color scheme with distinct, accessible colors for each region
  - Proper use of coord_fixed for circular aspect ratio
  - Inner concentric track adds visual depth as mentioned in spec
  - Realistic trade flow data scenario
  weaknesses:
  - Title appears cut off on the left side
  - Similar teal colors for North America and South America reduce differentiation
  - Title format includes descriptive prefix instead of just spec-id · library · pyplots.ai
