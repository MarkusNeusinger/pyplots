review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent manual implementation of violin plot using KDE calculation and patch
    rendering
  - Clean color scheme with Python Blue violins and golden yellow boxes provides excellent
    visual distinction
  - Proper legend with all four components clearly identified
  - Good data variety showing different distribution shapes (normal, bimodal, with
    outliers)
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai conventions
  - Appropriate font sizing for 4800x2700 canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is placed outside the plot area creating slight visual separation from
    the main plot
  - Outlier markers could be slightly larger for better visibility at full resolution
  - Grid/legend positioning could be improved by placing legend inside the plot area
