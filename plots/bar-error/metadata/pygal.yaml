review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of pygal native confidence interval (ci) feature for error bars
    with caps
  - Clean professional appearance with appropriate font scaling for 4800x2700 canvas
  - Well-chosen scientific context (treatment comparison) that matches spec applications
  - Proper title format and comprehensive axis labeling with units
  - Good use of custom Style for consistent visual appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Legend placement at bottom-left corner appears disconnected from the chart
  - Grid lines could be more subtle (currently dotted but still prominent)
  - Only symmetric error bars shown when spec mentions asymmetric as an option
  image_description: The plot displays a bar chart with 5 blue bars representing treatment
    groups (Control, Treatment A, Treatment B, Treatment C, Treatment D) on the x-axis.
    The y-axis shows "Response Value (units)" ranging from 0 to 100. Each bar has
    error bars extending vertically from the top, showing confidence intervals with
    horizontal caps at the ends. The bars are a consistent blue color (#306998). The
    title reads "bar-error · pygal · pyplots.ai" at the top. A legend at the bottom
    left shows "Mean ± 1 SD" with a blue square indicator. The background is white
    with subtle horizontal grid lines. Treatment B has the highest value (~78) and
    Control has the lowest (~45).
