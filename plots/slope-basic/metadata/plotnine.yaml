review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of slope chart using plotnine grammar of graphics
  - Clear color distinction between increasing (blue) and decreasing (yellow) trends
  - Labels at both endpoints with entity names on left and values on right
  - Good figure sizing (16x9) and text scaling for readability
  - Minimal theme with appropriate grid removal (no vertical gridlines)
  - Realistic business scenario (quarterly product sales) matching spec applications
  weaknesses:
  - Minor label overlap around similar values (Product J 180 / Product F 175)
  - Right-side labels could include product names for very long charts
  - Legend could be positioned differently to save horizontal space
  image_description: The plot displays a slope chart (slopegraph) comparing 10 products'
    sales between Q1 and Q4. Lines connect values at two time points, with blue (#306998)
    indicating increases and yellow (#FFD43B) indicating decreases. The left side
    shows product names with Q1 values in parentheses (e.g., "Product C (200)"), while
    the right side shows only Q4 values. The y-axis is labeled "Sales (thousands $)"
    ranging from approximately 65 to 230. X-axis shows "Q1" and "Q4" labels. A legend
    titled "Change Direction" appears on the right side. The layout is clean with
    minimal theme and removed vertical gridlines. There is some minor label overlapping
    visible around the 170-180 range where Product J and Product F are close together.

        comment: Good use of plotnine's grammar of graphics (ggplot, aes, geom_line,
          geom_point, geom_text), scale_color_manual, theme customization. Could utilize
          faceting or other advanced features, but appropriate for this simple plot
          type.
  verdict: APPROVED
