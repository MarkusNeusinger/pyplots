review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent colorblind-safe palette using Python Blue, Yellow, Teal, and Purple
  - Good force-directed layout configuration with verlet integration and proper simulation
    parameters
  - Node degree-based sizing effectively shows connection importance
  - Clean community structure visualization with clear cross-group bridges
  - Proper use of Highcharts networkgraph module with inline JS for headless Chrome
    compatibility
  - 15-second wait time ensures layout stabilization
  weaknesses:
  - Three node labels (Ivy, Tom, Paul) appear outside their nodes instead of centered
    inside, creating visual inconsistency
  - Legend is small and positioned far from the network in the right margin
  - Some layout imbalance with whitespace distribution
