review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent LOWESS implementation using geom_smooth with loess method and confidence
    band (se=True)
  - Perfect title format and descriptive axis labels with units
  - Realistic plant growth vs temperature scenario that naturally demonstrates LOWESS
    benefits
  - Good color contrast between blue points and yellow curve with appropriate transparency
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with reproducible seed
  weaknesses:
  - Confidence band fill color (#FFD43B) same as line color - could use a lighter/different
    shade for better visual distinction
  - Some imports listed individually could be consolidated (minor style issue)
