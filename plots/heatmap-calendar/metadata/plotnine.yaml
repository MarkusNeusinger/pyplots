review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent GitHub-style calendar heatmap visualization with clear weekday and month
    structure
  - Realistic data generation with patterns (weekday vs weekend, sprint periods, summer
    slowdown)
  - Clean sequential color gradient that is colorblind-accessible
  - Proper handling of ISO week numbering edge cases at year boundaries
  - Title follows the required format exactly
  - Good text sizing throughout (title 26pt bold, axis text 18pt, legend 16-18pt)
  weaknesses:
  - Layout has some unused space on the right side that could be better utilized
  - Weekday ordering shows Monday at top rather than following the spec suggested
    Sunday at top pattern
  - Legend could be positioned closer to the plot for better visual balance
