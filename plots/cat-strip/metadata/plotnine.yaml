review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent text sizing with clear title, axis labels, and tick marks all easily
    readable
  - Good use of geom_jitter with appropriate width parameter to show individual points
    without excessive overlap
  - Clean KISS code structure following the template exactly
  - Realistic product performance scenario with varied distributions showing different
    spreads and means
  - Proper use of theme_minimal() for a clean, professional appearance
  weaknesses:
  - Color scheme alternates blue/yellow by category but this does not convey meaningful
    information - could use a single color or gradient
  - Axis label Performance Score lacks units (e.g., Performance Score (%) or similar)
  - Some performance scores exceed 100 which may seem unrealistic for a typical percentage-based
    score
