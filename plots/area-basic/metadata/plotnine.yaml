review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent gradient fill technique using 24 stacked geom_ribbon layers creating
    a smooth bottom-to-top gradient effect
  - Strong data storytelling with three well-placed annotations (peak, maintenance
    dip, trend) plus narrative subtitle
  - LOWESS trend line using plotnine native geom_smooth is a distinctive library feature
  - Thoughtful data generation with weekly cycles, upward trend, maintenance dip,
    and plateau showing diverse area chart features
  - Publication-quality styling with custom colors, refined gridlines, and intentional
    typographic hierarchy
  weaknesses:
  - The 24-layer gradient approach with functools.reduce adds code complexity; a single
    geom_ribbon with appropriate alpha could be simpler
  - LM-02 could reach 5/5 with additional plotnine-specific features like scale_*_gradient
    or custom stat layers
  image_description: 'The plot displays a basic area chart of daily website visitors
    over January 2024. A dark blue line (#1e4d6d, size 1.8) traces the daily values,
    with the area below filled using a smooth gradient effect created by 24 stacked
    semi-transparent blue ribbon layers, transitioning from light at the bottom to
    deeper blue near the line. A gold/yellow LOWESS trend line runs through the data
    showing the overall upward trajectory. The title "area-basic · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    is bold at 24pt, with an italic subtitle describing the upward trend with weekly
    cycles, a mid-month maintenance dip, and a brief plateau. Three annotations are
    present: "Peak: 8,213" in bold dark blue near the top-right, "Maintenance: 3,242"
    in italic gray near the mid-month dip, and "Trend (LOWESS)" in bold gold labeling
    the trend line. The x-axis shows dates (Jan 01 through Jan 29) labeled "Date (January
    2024)", the y-axis shows comma-formatted values labeled "Daily Visitors (count)".
    The panel has a light gray (#f8f9fa) background with subtle gridlines, white plot
    background, and balanced margins in a 16:9 aspect ratio.'
