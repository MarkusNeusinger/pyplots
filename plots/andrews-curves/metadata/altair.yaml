review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent Andrews curves transformation with correct Fourier series implementation
  - Good use of transparency (opacity=0.4) for overlapping curves as recommended in
    spec
  - Proper data normalization using StandardScaler before transformation
  - Clear cluster separation visible between species groups
  - Correct title format following pyplots.ai convention
  weaknesses:
  - Missing fixed random seed for full reproducibility (sklearn data is deterministic
    but explicit seed is preferred)
  - Legend text is slightly small relative to plot size
  - Could benefit from a subtitle explaining the visualization technique
