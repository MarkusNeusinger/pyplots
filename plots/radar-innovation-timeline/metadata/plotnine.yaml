review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent 270° arc radar layout with concentric ring fills creating clear visual
    hierarchy from Adopt (green, near-term) to Hold (pink, future)
  - Smart size/alpha encoding by ring adds storytelling dimension — prominent Adopt
    items vs. faded Hold items
  - Effective iterative label collision avoidance algorithm handles 26 labeled items
    without significant overlap
  - Perfect spec compliance with all requested features (ring labels, sector headers,
    background fills, distinct colors, legend)
  - Realistic current technology data with sensible ring placements (e.g., Kubernetes
    in Adopt, Quantum ML in Hold)
  - Clean polished design with removed axes/ticks/gridlines and subtle gray ring boundaries
  weaknesses:
  - Item label text at size 11 and ring labels at size 10 could be slightly larger
    for better readability at publication scale
  - Blue (#1565C0) and teal (#00897B) sector colors are somewhat close perceptually
    especially for color vision deficiency — wider hue separation would improve accessibility
  - Some items at outer Hold ring (e.g., Neuromorphic Comp.) appear somewhat isolated
    from main radar body due to label offset distance
  image_description: 'The plot displays an innovation radar chart using a 270° arc
    layout (open at the bottom). Four concentric rings represent time horizons from
    innermost (Adopt — green-tinted fill) to outermost (Hold — pink-tinted fill),
    with Trial (yellow) and Assess (orange) in between. The arc is divided into four
    equal angular sectors: Data Engineering (top-left, orange markers), Cloud & Infra
    (top-right, teal markers), Security (bottom-left, magenta markers), and AI & ML
    (bottom-right, blue markers). Twenty-six labeled technology items are scattered
    across rings and sectors as colored circular markers. Marker size decreases and
    alpha fades from inner (Adopt) to outer (Hold) rings, reinforcing the time-horizon
    narrative. Sector headers appear in bold at the outer edge of each sector. Ring
    labels (Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold) are positioned in the bottom gap of the arc.
    Subtle gray boundary arcs separate rings, and gray spokes separate sectors. A
    legend in the bottom-left corner maps colors to the four categories. The title
    "radar-innovation-timeline · plotnine · pyplots.ai" is bold and centered at the
    top, with an italic subtitle explaining the ring semantics. The background is
    white with no axes or gridlines.'

        comment: Good marker sizing with size/alpha encoding by ring. Hold-ring items
