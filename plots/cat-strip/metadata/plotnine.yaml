review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of ggplot2 grammar with clean, readable code structure
  - Perfect title format and axis labeling with units
  - Good choice of realistic agricultural data scenario (crop yield by soil type)
  - Appropriate point sizing and transparency for 100 data points
  - Different distributions per category demonstrate the plot type's purpose effectively
  weaknesses:
  - Could leverage more plotnine-specific features like stat_summary or facet_wrap
  - Color palette could be more distinctly colorblind-safe (yellow and tan are somewhat
    similar)
