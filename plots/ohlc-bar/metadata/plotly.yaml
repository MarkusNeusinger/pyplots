review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Plotly native OHLC trace type which handles bar rendering automatically
  - Colorblind-safe color scheme using Python signature blue and yellow
  - Realistic stock price data generation with proper OHLC relationships
  - Clean disabling of range slider for uncluttered static view
  - Both PNG and HTML outputs provided for static and interactive use
  weaknesses:
  - 'Minor: showlegend=False hides legend elements, though reasonable for single-series
    OHLC'
  image_description: The plot displays an OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) bar chart showing
    45 trading days of stock price data from early June through late July 2024. Each
    bar consists of a vertical line representing the high-low range, with horizontal
    ticks on the left for open price and right for close price. Blue bars (#306998,
    "Python Blue") indicate up days (close > open) and yellow/gold bars (#FFD43B,
    "Python Yellow") indicate down days (close < open). The price ranges from approximately
    $125 to $170, showing an overall downward trend from ~$165 in mid-June to ~$130
    by late July. The title "ohlc-bar · plotly · pyplots.ai" is centered at the top
    in a large, readable font. The x-axis shows dates formatted as "Mon DD" (e.g.,
    "Jun 09", "Jul 14") and the y-axis shows "Price (USD)" with dollar-prefixed tick
    values. A subtle gray grid (alpha 0.3) aids in reading exact price levels. The
    layout is clean with balanced margins, no range slider, and the plot fills the
    canvas well.
