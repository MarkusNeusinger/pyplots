review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent creative solution using tile grid cartogram approach for choropleth
    visualization
  - Clean, readable layout with well-sized state labels and values
  - Good use of seaborn heatmap function with appropriate colormap
  - Realistic economic data scenario with plausible GDP growth rates
  - Good colorblind-friendly palette choice (YlGnBu)
  - Well-structured code following KISS principles
  weaknesses:
  - Title format includes extra descriptive text instead of strictly following spec-id
    format
  - Missing data handling (gray hatched cells) not visible in rendered image
  - Subtitle text could be slightly larger for better readability
  - Could show wider range of values to demonstrate more color scale variation
