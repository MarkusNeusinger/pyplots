review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent maze generation using DFS algorithm that guarantees a single solution
    path
  - Perfect black-and-white print-friendly design matching spec requirements
  - Creative use of plotnine geom_tile to render maze walls effectively
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles
  - Proper use of coord_fixed(ratio=1) for square maze cells
  - theme_void() creates clean, distraction-free output ideal for printing
  weaknesses:
  - The S and G markers could be slightly larger for better visibility when printed
    at smaller sizes
  - Margins are present but minimal - spec mentions adequate margins for printing
  image_description: The plot displays a 25x25 cell maze puzzle rendered in black
    and white. Black rectangular tiles form the walls of the maze on a white background.
    The maze has clear pathways (white corridors) between the black walls. An "S"
    marker in blue (#306998) is positioned at the top-left corner indicating the start
    position. A "G" marker in the same blue color is positioned at the bottom-right
    corner indicating the goal. The title "maze-printable · plotnine · pyplots.ai"
    appears centered at the top of the image. The maze uses a square 1:1 aspect ratio
    format appropriate for this type of visualization. The wall thickness is consistent
    throughout, and the passages appear wide enough for pen/pencil marking.
