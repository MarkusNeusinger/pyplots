review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent spec compliance — all specification notes addressed (area-based scaling,
    transparency, size legend)
  - Clean, professional visual design with subtle grid, removed tick marks, and white
    edge highlighting on bubbles
  - Realistic city metrics scenario with plausible data ranges
  - Dual output (PNG + HTML) leverages Bokeh interactive capability
  - Well-structured, readable code following KISS principle
  weaknesses:
  - Data storytelling is weak — the plot displays data without guiding the viewer
    to an insight; consider adding visual emphasis (e.g., color gradient for a fourth
    dimension, highlighted outlier cities, or size-based opacity variation) to create
    a focal point
  - The size legend is placed in data coordinate space, which extends the x_range
    to 13000 and creates empty space in the lower-right quadrant; positioning it outside
    the data area or using a Bokeh Legend/annotation box would be cleaner
  - Visual refinement could be improved — axis spines are still visible, and the overall
    design, while clean, does not reach publication-quality polish
  improvements: []
  verdict: REJECTED
  image_description: The plot displays a bubble chart with 40 data points representing
    cities, plotted on a 4800x2700 canvas. The X-axis shows "Population Density (people/km²)"
    ranging from 0 to ~12000, and the Y-axis shows "Median Income (thousands USD)"
    ranging from ~27 to ~65. All bubbles are a muted steel blue (#306998) with ~55%
    transparency and thin white edge lines, varying in size to represent green space
    per capita (the third dimension). A clear positive correlation between population
    density and median income is visible. A manually constructed size legend in the
    bottom-right data area shows three reference bubbles labeled "Green Space" with
    values "5 m²/capita" (smallest), "31 m²/capita" (medium), and "56 m²/capita" (largest).
    The title "bubble-basic · bokeh · pyplots.ai" appears in the top-left corner.
    Grid lines are subtle (low alpha), tick marks are removed, and the overall appearance
    is clean and professional.
