review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent implementation of a financial dashboard subplot grid with 4 distinct
    chart types
  - Perfect title format following the spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Colorblind-safe color palette throughout (blue, yellow, purple)
  - Clean CSS grid layout for positioning the 4 charts
  - Realistic financial data scenario with meaningful relationships between price,
    volume, and returns
  - Moving average overlay on price chart demonstrates multi-series capability
  - Good use of Highcharts container system for multi-chart layout
  weaknesses:
  - Histogram x-axis labels (return percentages) are not visible in the rendered output
  - LineSeries imported from .area module instead of .line module (minor code issue)
  - Could benefit from synchronized tooltips across charts for better interactivity
  - Legend disabled on most charts where it could provide useful context
