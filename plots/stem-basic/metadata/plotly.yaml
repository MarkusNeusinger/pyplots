review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent stem plot implementation using Plotly graph_objects with clear vertical
    stems and circular markers
  - Well-designed hover template showing sample index and amplitude with 3 decimal
    precision
  - Good use of signal processing context (damped oscillation) that demonstrates stem
    plot purpose
  - Clean code structure following KISS principles with proper reproducibility (seed=42)
  - Appropriate marker sizing (16px) with white border for visibility against stems
  weaknesses:
  - Axis labels lack units (could use Sample Index (n) and Amplitude (a.u.) for dimensionless
    quantities)
  - Grid alpha (0.1) is very subtle, could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3) for
    better readability
