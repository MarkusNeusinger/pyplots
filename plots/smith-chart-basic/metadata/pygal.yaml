review:
  strengths:
  - Correctly implements Smith chart mathematics (impedance to reflection coefficient
    transformation)
  - Clean separation of grid elements (R circles, X arcs) as grouped data series
  - Realistic antenna impedance data with frequency sweep
  - Good use of color differentiation between grid (gray), boundary (blue), and data
    (red)
  - Frequency markers clearly labeled in legend with distinct colors
  - Square aspect ratio appropriate for circular Smith chart
  - Custom style provides good text sizing for 3600px canvas
  weaknesses:
  - Legend is overcrowded with 8 entries including grid elements that could be unlabeled
  - Grid elements (R Grid, X Grid, Real Axis) should not appear in legend as they
    are structural, not data
  - Frequency marker labels only appear in legend, not as annotations near the actual
    points on the chart
  image_description: 'The plot displays a Smith chart for RF/impedance analysis rendered
    at 3600×3600 pixels (square format). The chart features a blue unit circle boundary
    (|Γ|=1) as the outer edge, with light gray dashed constant resistance circles
    and constant reactance arcs forming the characteristic Smith chart grid pattern.
    A dark gray horizontal real axis runs through the center. The impedance locus
    data ("Antenna Z(f)") is plotted in red/coral color as a connected line with small
    dots showing an antenna impedance sweep. Three larger colored markers indicate
    frequency points: a purple dot for 1 GHz, a yellow/orange dot for 3.5 GHz, and
    a green dot for 6 GHz. The title "smith-chart-basic · pygal · pyplots.ai" appears
    at the top. Axis labels show "Reflection Coefficient Real Part" (x-axis) and "Reflection
    Coefficient Imaginary Part" (y-axis). A legend at the bottom lists all series
    including the boundary, R Grid, X Grid, Real Axis, Antenna Z(f), and the three
    frequency markers.'
