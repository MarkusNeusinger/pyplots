review:
  strengths:
  - 'Excellent data storytelling: the progression from 20 tightly-clustered events
    to 200 dispersed events clearly shows temporal spread'
  - Realistic seismic scenario with appropriate magnitude decay pattern
  - Clean small multiples layout following the spec fallback for non-animation libraries
  - Good use of lets-plot gggrid for combining multiple plots with shared title
  - Appropriate color scale (yellow-red) that is colorblind accessible
  - California basemap provides good geographic context
  weaknesses:
  - No axis labels for lat/lon coordinates (minor for map visualizations but could
    help orientation)
  - Legend hidden - while understandable for space, a shared legend for magnitude
    would improve interpretability
  - Could use lets-plot faceting (facet_wrap) instead of manual gggrid construction
    for cleaner code
  image_description: The plot displays a 2x2 small multiples grid showing seismic
    activity spread across central California over 6 weeks. Each panel shows a simplified
    California state outline in light gray (#E8E8E8) with darker gray border. Earthquake
    events are rendered as circular markers with both size and color mapped to magnitude
    - using a yellow (#FFD43B) to red (#DC2626) gradient where larger/redder markers
    indicate higher magnitude. Week 1 shows 20 events tightly clustered near the epicenter,
    Week 2 shows 65 events beginning to spread, Week 4 shows 155 events with noticeable
    outward expansion, and Week 6 shows all 200 events fully dispersed. The overall
    title reads "Seismic Activity Spread · map-animated-temporal · letsplot · pyplots.ai"
    and a caption at the bottom explains "Aftershock sequence spreading from epicenter
    over 6 weeks | Central California region". Each panel has a bold "Week X" title
    with event count subtitle. Alpha transparency (0.7) helps visualize overlapping
    points. The void theme removes axes for clean map presentation.
