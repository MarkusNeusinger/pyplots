review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent data scenario using country economic indicators - highly relatable and
    demonstrates the bubble chart use case perfectly
  - Clean implementation of dual legends (size and region) which is non-trivial
  - Appropriate log scaling for population sizes to handle multiple orders of magnitude
  - Well-structured regional data generation with realistic parameter ranges per region
  - Good alpha transparency and size scaling for bubble visibility
  weaknesses:
  - Region legend shows tiny dot markers instead of appropriately-sized circles, making
    color identification difficult
  - Does not leverage seaborn-specific statistical features (e.g., could add regression
    line, confidence intervals, or use relplot for faceting by region)
  - Color palette not using seaborn built-in colorblind-safe palettes (colorblind,
    Set2)
