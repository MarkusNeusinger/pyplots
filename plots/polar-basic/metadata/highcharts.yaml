review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent use of Highcharts polar chart capability with proper configuration
  - Realistic 24-hour temperature scenario directly from spec applications
  - Proper title format following pyplots conventions
  - Clean, readable code structure with reproducible seed
  - Good color choice (Python Blue) that is colorblind-safe
  - Properly downloads and embeds Highcharts JS including highcharts-more.js for polar
    support
  - Interactive HTML version also saved with responsive sizing
  weaknesses:
  - Y-axis (radial) title is rotated vertically making it harder to read
  - Grid alpha could be slightly more visible (0.2-0.3 rather than 0.15)
  - Could use hour labels (0h, 6h, 12h, 18h) instead of degrees for better context
