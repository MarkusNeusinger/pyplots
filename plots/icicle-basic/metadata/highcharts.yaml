review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent hierarchical visualization with clear parent-child relationships through
    spatial adjacency
  - Colorblind-safe palette with good contrast between categories
  - Realistic file system example matching spec applications
  - Creative use of Highcharts renderer API to implement icicle chart (not a native
    chart type)
  - Well-formatted title following spec-id · library · pyplots.ai convention
  - Good label truncation strategy prevents overlap while showing as much text as
    possible
  weaknesses:
  - Some leaf node labels are truncated (e.g., Footer, Modal.tsx) - could show more
    with smaller font
  - Uses helper functions instead of pure KISS linear code structure
