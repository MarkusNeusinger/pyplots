review:
  strengths:
  - Excellent visual design with professional dashboard aesthetics
  - Proper color-coded status indicators with green/orange left borders
  - Smart change direction logic (lower is better for CPU/Memory/Error Rate, higher
    is better for Requests/sec)
  - Clean sparkline implementation using Highcharts area charts with gradient fills
  - Responsive grid layout following spec requirements (3x2 for 6 tiles)
  - Correct title format per specification
  weaknesses:
  - Does not include a critical status example (only shows good and warning)
  - Sparklines could be slightly more prominent for the overall canvas size
  - Uses custom helper functions rather than pure KISS structure (acceptable for complexity)
  image_description: |-
    The dashboard displays 6 metric tiles arranged in a 3x2 grid layout on a light gray (#F3F4F6) background. The main title "dashboard-metrics-tiles · highcharts · pyplots.ai" appears centered at the top in dark gray text.

    Each tile is a white rounded rectangle with a colored left border indicating status: green (#059669) for "good" status tiles (CPU Usage, Response Time, Requests/sec, Disk I/O) and orange/amber (#D97706) for "warning" status tiles (Memory, Error Rate).

    Inside each tile:
    - Metric name appears at top in gray (36px equivalent): CPU Usage, Memory, Response Time, Requests/sec, Error Rate, Disk I/O
    - Large value displayed prominently in dark gray: 45, 72, 120, 1,250, 2.3, 156
    - Unit shown next to the value: %, %, ms, (none), %, MB/s
    - Change indicator with colored arrow and percentage: down arrows in green (▼ 5.2%, ▼ 15.0%, ▼ 3.2%) for favorable decreases, up arrows in red (▲ 8.3%, ▲ 0.8%) for unfavorable increases, and green up arrow (▲ 12.5%) for Requests/sec where increase is favorable
    - Sparkline at the bottom showing the 20-point historical trend as a blue (#306998) area chart with gradient fill

    The layout uses balanced spacing with consistent tile dimensions and proper gaps between tiles.

          slight concern that error rate at 2.3% being warning could be debated

        comment: Uses Highcharts area charts for sparklines with gradient fills, but
          the dashboard is primarily HTML/CSS with embedded Highcharts charts; could
          leverage more Highcharts-specific features
